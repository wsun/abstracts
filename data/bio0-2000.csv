Depending upon the discipline, complex systems theory has accrued many flavors. We are after a formal representation, a model that can predict the outcome of a complex adaptive system (CAS). In this article, we look at the nature of complexity, then provide a perspective based on discrete event systems (DEVS) theory. We pin down many of the shared features between CAS and artificial systems. We begin with an overview of network science showing how adaptive behavior in these scale-free networks can lead to emergence through stigmergy in CAS. We also address how both self-organization and emergence interplay in a CAS. We then build a case for the view that stigmergic systems are a special case of CAS. We then discuss DEVS levels of systems specifications and present the dynamic structure extensions of DEVS formalism that lends itself to a study of CAS and in turn, stigmergy. Finally, we address the shortcomings and the limitation of current DEVS extensions and propose the required augmentation to model stigmergy and CAS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.

We reviewed relevant articles for the pathogenesis, histopathology, and quantitative changes in melanocytes related to specific etiologies of PIH. Methodologies to quantify pigmentation changes in dermatologic conditions with clinical hyperpigmentation were also explored.Results: Significant increases in melanocyte counts of irritant affected skin is seen compared with melanocyte counts of unaffected skin. An increase in melanocyte counts was also found for spontaneous inflammatory dermatoses, even in the absence of clinical hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, changes in melanocyte density and appearance are also seen secondary to inflammation. In addition, increases in epidermal melanocytes are seen with cutaneous exposure to certain agents, and melanocyte increases vary by exposure agent.Conclusions: The degree of hyperpigmentation related to the intensity and duration of exposure to the causative factors of PIH is essential to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease process. The application of new methodologies to determine quantitative changes in melanocytes elicited by specific causative inflammatory agents has implications to prevent PIH, add to knowledge about disease duration, to develop better treatments for PIH, and to aid our understanding of the biology of the melanocyte.

The contribution of AnxA1 to human cell biology is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of AnxA1 and its receptor, formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), to the regulation of inflammatory responses in human normal lung fibroblasts (NLF). Silencing constitutive AnxA1 expression in NLF using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with moderate but significant increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced proliferation and interleukin (IL)-6 production, accompanied by reduction of ERK and NF-kappa B activity. AnxA1 regulation of ERK and NF-kappa B activation was associated with effects on proliferation. Blocking FPR2 using the specific antagonist WRW4 mimicked the effects of AnxA1 silencing on TNF-induced proliferation, IL-6, ERK, and NF-kappa B activation. AnxA1 silencing also impaired inhibitory effects of glucocorticoid on IL-6 production and on the expression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), but blocking FPR2 failed to mimic these effects of AnxA1 silencing. These data suggest that AnxA1 regulates TNF-induced proliferation and inflammatory responses in lung fibroblasts, via effects on the ERK and NF-kappa B pathways, which depend on FPR2. AnxA1 also mediates effects of glucocorticoids and GILZ expression, but these effects appear independent of FPR2. These findings suggest that mimicking AnxA1 actions might have therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory lung diseases. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 476484, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Firstly, we prove global existence of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem without any smallness assumption on the initial data. Secondly, we prove both global existence and asymptotic behavior of smooth solutions, provided the initial data are of small H-1-norm energy but possibly large H-s-norm energy. Finally, if the H-s boolean AND L-1-norm of initial data are sufficiently small, we also establish decay rates of the global smooth solutions. These results are obtained by constructing a new nonnegative convex entropy and combining spectral analysis with energy methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was motivated by some problems arising from computational biology, for reverse engineering the structure of mechanisms in gene regulatory networks. For this purpose polynomial expressions have to be generated, which match known state combinations observed during experiments. Earlier approaches using Grobner techniques have not been powerful enough to treat real-world applications.The proposed method avoids expensive Grobner basis computations completely by directly calculating reduced normal forms. The problem statement can be described by Boolean polynomials, i.e. polynomials with coefficients in {0, 1} and a degree bound of one for each variable. Therefore, the reference implementations mentioned in this work are built on the top of the POLYBORI framework, which has been designed exclusively for the treatment of this special class of polynomials.A series of randomly generated examples is used to demonstrate the performance of the direct method. It is also compared with other approaches, which incorporate Grobner basis computations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The most frequent type, clear-cell carcinoma, is not homogenous regarding gene mutations or transcriptomic profiles, but the biologic classifications are not yet mature. Therefore, biologically driven strategies of treatment have not yet been developed in the clinical setting. The choice of first-line agent currently depends on the prognostic criteria published by Motzer et al. [J Clin Oncol 1999;17:2530-2540] and recently by Heng et al. [J Clin Oncol 2009;27:5794-5799], with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies for good- or intermediate-prognosis groups and anti-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for poor-risk patients. In the past years, biological changes leading to resistance to targeted agents have been widely investigated. Discoveries resulted in the development of second-generation VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, characterized by an improved potency and selectivity. Besides, co-inhibition of signalling pathways mediating resistance to anti-VEGF are being developed targeting fibroblast growth factor and c-Met. Dual mTOR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors have greater efficacy than rapalogs in preclinical models and are being investigated in early clinical trials. In conclusion, the changing landscape in the biology and treatment of kidney cancer offers new opportunities for clinicians to treat patients, but, due to relatively high costs, the use of targeted therapies will likely be strongly controlled by health authorities.

In contrast, lineage committed cells acquire an extended symmetrical cell cycle. Self-renewal of tissue-specific stem cells is sustained by asymmetric cell division where one progeny cell remains a progenitor while the partner progeny cell exits the cell cycle and differentiates. There are three principal contexts for considering the operation and regulation of the pluripotent cell cycle: temporal, regulatory, and structural. The primary temporal context that the pluripotent self-renewal cell cycle of hESCs is a short G1 period without reducing periods of time allocated to S phase, G2, and mitosis. The rules that govern proliferation in hESCs remain to be comprehensively established. However, several lines of evidence suggest a key role for the naive transcriptome of hESCs, which is competent to stringently regulate the embryonic stem cell (ESC) cell cycle. This supports the requirements of pluripotent cells to self-propagate while suppressing expression of genes that confer lineage commitment and/or tissue specificity. However, for the first time, we consider unique dimensions to the architectural organization and assembly of regulatory machinery for gene expression in nuclear microenviornments that define parameters of pluripotency. From both fundamental biological and clinical perspectives, understanding control of the abbreviated ESC cycle can provide options to coordinate control of proliferation versus differentiation. Wound healing, tissue engineering, and cell-based therapy to mitigate developmental aberrations illustrate applications that benefit from knowledge of the biology of the pluripotent cell cycle. J.

A special form of this equation is the Hutchinson-Wright equation which is a mile stone in the mathematical modeling of population dynamics and mathematical biology. Taking the delay parameter as a bifurcation parameter, Hopf bifurcation analysis is studied by following the theory in the book by Hazzard et al. By analyzing the associated characteristic polynomial, we determine necessary conditions for the linear stability and Hopf bifurcation. In addition to this analysis, the direction of bifurcation, the stability and the period of a periodic solution to this equation are evaluated at a bifurcation value by using the Poincare normal form and the center manifold theorem.

Probe 1 showed excellent high selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg2+ over commonly coexistent metal ions in neutral solution, which could be attributed to the Hg2+-triggered ring opening of the spirolactam of the rhodamine moiety and the formation of a 1:1 1-Hg2+ complex.

The pathobiological mechanisms of human AAA are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to identify novel pathways involved in the development of AAAs. Methods: A custom-designed 'AAA-chip' was used to assay 43 of the differentially expressed genes identified in a previously published microarray study between AAA (n = 15) and control (n = 15) infrarenal abdominal aorta. Protein analyses were performed on selected genes. Results: Altogether 38 of the 43 genes on the 'AAA-chip' showed significantly different expression. Novel validated genes in AAA pathobiology included ADCY7, ARL4C, BLNK, FOSB, GATM, LYZ, MFGE8, PRUNE2, PTPRC, SMTN, TMODI and TPM2. These genes represent a wide range of biological functions, such as calcium signaling, development and differentiation, as well as cell adhesion not previously implicated in AAA pathobiology. Protein analyses for GATM, CD4, CXCR4, BLNK, PLEK, LYZ, FOSB, DUSP6, ITGA5 and PTPRC confirmed the mRNA findings. Conclusion: The results provide new directions for future research into AAA pathogenesis to study the role of novel genes confirmed here.

The groups were daughter cells with no bud scars, and mother cells separated further by number of scars (one, two and more than two). Cells with more than three scars were very rare.Compression testing by micromanipulation was used to determine key mechanical properties of the sorted cells. For all cells the force and fractional deformation at bursting could be determined. For 69% of cells overall but only 32% of daughter cells, a large strain mathematical model using a linear elastic constitutive equation for the wall material could be fitted to force deformation data up to cell wall failure. For these cells, the wall surface modulus, elastic modulus, initial stretch ratio and strain energy per unit volume at bursting could be estimated. For the remainder of the cells, the lack of permanent deformation on repeated compression and release (at deformations not causing bursting) suggested the cell wall material was non-linear elastic but with no observable plastic behaviour.This is the first report to show directly that bud scars affect the global mechanical properties of yeast cells and that the important distinction with respect to scars is between daughter and mother cells. The former were smaller with more elastic walls and a higher mean initial stretch ratio. For cells for which the model could be fitted, the mean circumferential strain at bursting decreased with scarring (consistent with stiffer walls) whilst the stress increased. This may be due to the reported absence of chitin in the walls of daughter cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

NO is synthesized by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and often functions through its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG). This study combined NO imaging, immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology to localize NO and its downstream signaling pathways in the mouse retina. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) was localized primarily in puncta in the inner plexiform layer, in amacrine cells, and in somata in the ganglion cell layer. Endothelial NOS was in blood vessels. Light-stimulated NO production imaged with diaminofluorescein was present in somata in the inner nuclear layer and in synaptic boutons in the inner plexiform layer. The downstream target of NO, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), was in somata in the inner and outer nuclear layers and in both plexiform layers. Cyclic GMP immunocytochemistry was used functionally to localize sGC that was activated by an NO donor in amacrine, bipolar, and ganglion cells. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) Ia was found in bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and both plexiform layers, whereas PKG II was found in the outer plexiform layer, amacrine cells, and somata in the ganglion cell layer. This study shows that the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is functional and widely distributed in specific cell types in the outer and inner mouse retina. A better understanding of these signaling pathways in normal retina will provide a firm basis for targeting their roles in retinal pathology. J. Comp. Neurol. 520:42044217, 2012.

The current manuscript presents an analysis of multi-scale interactions involved in D. discoideum aggregation and non-aggregation events. The multi-scale fractal dimensions of a sequence of microscope images were used to estimate changing structure at different spatial scales. Three regions showing aggregation and three showing non-aggregation were considered. The results showed that both aggregation and non-aggregation regions were strongly multi-fractal. Analyses of the over-time relationships among nine scales of the generalized dimension, D(q), were conducted using vector autoregression and vector error-correction models. Both types of regions showed evidence that across-scale interactions serve to maintain the equilibrium of the system. Aggregation and non-aggregation regions also showed different patterns of effects of individual scales on other scales. Specifically, aggregation regions showed greater effects of both the smallest and largest scales on the smaller scale structures. The results suggest that multi-scale interactions are responsible for maintaining and altering the cellular structures during aggregation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We encourage the incorporation of new sensors and new energy sources within the operational environment of UK-sustained observational programmes to bridge the gap that normally separates laboratory prototype from operational instrument. For interpreting the climate-change records obtained through a variety of national and international sustained observational programmes, creative and dedicated UK scientists should lead efforts to extract the meaningful signals and patterns of climate change and to interpret them so as to project future changes.

UK researchers have authored articles of high impact in all areas described here. In contrast to terrestrial geoscience, however, there have been few instrumented observations made of active processes by UK scientists. This is an area that could be developed over the next decades in the UK. Research on active processes has the potential ability to engage the wider public: Some active processes present significant geo-hazards to populations and offshore infrastructure that require monitoring and there could be commercial applications of technological developments needed for science. Some of the suggestions could involve studies in shallow coastal waters where ship costs are much reduced, addressing tighter funding constraints over the near term. The possibilities of measuring aspects of volcanic eruptions, flowing lava, turbidity currents and mass movements (landslides) are discussed. A further area of potential development is in greater collaboration between the ocean sciences. For example, it is well known in terrestrial geomorphology that biological agents are important in modulating erosion and the transport of sediments, ultimately affecting the shape of the Earth's surface in various ways. The analogous effect of biology on large-scale geomorphology in the oceans is also known but remains poorly quantified. Physical oceanographic models are becoming increasingly accurate and could be used to study further the patterns of erosion, particle transport and deposition in the oceans. Marine geological and geophysical data could in turn be useful for further verification of such models.

Our approach takes the form of a commentary designed to inform responses to future calls for research in predictive toxicology. It is considered essential that computational model-building activities be at the centre of the initiative, driving an iterative process of development, testing and refinement. It is critical that the models provide mechanistic understanding and quantitative predictions. The aim would be to predict effects in humans: in order to help define a challenging but yet feasible initial goal the focus would be on liver mitochondrial toxicity.

Fibrillar collagen in the vascular wall plays a central role in tissue adaptation owing to its relatively short lifetime. Pathological alterations of collagen turnover may fail to result in homeostasis and could be responsible for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth at later stages of the disease. For this reason our previously reported multiscale constitutive framework (Martufi, G. & Gasser, T. C. 2011 J. Biomech. 44, 2544-2550 (doi:10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.07.015)) has been enriched by a collagen turnover model. Specifically, the framework's collagen fibril level allowed a sound integration of vascular wall biology, and the impact of collagen turnover on the macroscopic properties of AAAs was studied. To this end, model parameters were taken from the literature and/or estimated from clinical follow-up data of AAAs (on average 50.7 mm-large). Likewise, the in vivo stretch of the AAA wall was set, such that 10 per cent of collagen fibres were engaged. Results showed that the stretch spectrum, at which collagen fibrils are deposed, is the most influential parameter, i.e. it determines whether the vascular geometry grows, shrinks or remains stable over time. Most importantly, collagen turnover also had a remarkable impact on the macroscopic stress field. It avoided high stress gradients across the vessel wall, thus predicted a physiologically reasonable stress field. Although the constitutive model could be successfully calibrated to match the growth of small AAAs, a rigorous validation against experimental data is crucial to further explore the model's descriptive and predictive capabilities.

We used those flow fields to characterize the aerodynamic footprint in unprecedented detail and revealed previously unseen wake elements that would have gone undetected by two-dimensional or stereo-imaging technology. Vortex iso-surface topographies show the spatio-temporal signature of aerodynamic force generation manifest in the wake of locusts, and expose the extent to which animal wakes can deform, potentially leading to unreliable calculations of lift and thrust when using conventional diagnostic methods.

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N > 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.

The gradient has been hypothesized to be dependent on the biology of the wasps, but recently questions of sampling and description biases have been raised. Here, we show with primary data that the species richness of Ichneumonidae is markedly underestimated in tropical areas and that latitudinal diversity patterns in the family remain uncharacterized. We discovered a startling 177 likely undescribed orthocentrine species with relatively low sampling effort in the forests of Central America and Amazonian Ecuador, over three times the previously known orthocentrine diversity in the world's tropics. Species accumulation curves reveal that we are just beginning to unveil the true extent of tropical orthocentrine diversity. We also found evidence for cryptic species; our DNA analysis revealed additional species not easily distinguishable using morphological characteristics. The difficulty in establishing species richness patterns of Ichneumonidae probably follows from the relative lack of taxonomic expertise and the low density of ichneumonid species throughout the landscape.

One topic of intense interest is the search of specific behavioural mechanisms at stake at the individual level and from which the school properties emerges. This is fundamental for understanding how selective pressure acting at the individual level promotes adaptive properties of schools and in trying to disambiguate functional properties from non-adaptive epiphenomena. Decades of studies on collective motion by means of individual-based modelling have allowed a qualitative understanding of the self-organization processes leading to collective properties at school level, and provided an insight into the behavioural mechanisms that result in coordinated motion. Here, we emphasize a set of paradigmatic modelling assumptions whose validity remains unclear, both from a behavioural point of view and in terms of quantitative agreement between model outcome and empirical data. We advocate for a specific and biologically oriented re-examination of these assumptions through experimental-based behavioural analysis and modelling.

Motility of the rod-shaped cells of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus depends on two motility machineries, type IV pili (giving rise to S-motility) and the gliding motility apparatus (giving rise to A-motility). Cell motility is regulated by occasional reversals. Moving M. xanthus cells can organize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies, depending on their nutritional status. To ultimately understand these two pattern-formation processes and the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as the cell reversal machinery, we analyse spatial self-organization in three M. xanthus strains: (i) a mutant that moves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, (ii) a unidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and (iii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, occasionally reverses its direction of movement. The mutant moving by means of the A-engine illustrates that collective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding bacteria owing to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need of invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant reveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are present, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the study of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces the formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while it results in vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are consistent with what is known from self-propelled rod models, which strongly suggests that the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions is the pattern-formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. On the other hand, we learn that when cells occasionally reverse their moving direction, as observed in the wild-type, cells form small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like structure at high enough densities. These results have been obtained from a careful analysis of the cluster statistics of ensembles of cells, and analysed in the light of a coagulation Smoluchowski equation with fragmentation.

Information about these interactions can improve our understanding of diseases and provide the basis to revolutionize therapeutic treatments. However, current experimental techniques for large-scale detection of protein-protein interactions are biased against membrane proteins, it is necessary to develop novel tools to deal with this kind of bio-network. To realize this, we construct membrane protein interaction network based on gene regulatory network model. Three model forms, basic form, non-dimensionalization form, and more complex form, are proposed to understand the dynamic and collective control of developmental process and the characters of membrane protein interaction network, including small-world network, scale free distributing and robustness, and its significance for biology. Four simulation examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and flexibility of the GRN model method for the study of membrane protein interaction network. The results show that the proposed approach holds a high potential to become a useful tool in prediction of membrane protein interactions. Moreover, it has biological significance and value for biology and pharmacology. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sulfated fucans (SFs) and sulfated galactans (SGs) are one of these classes of glycans with increasing interest to both glycomics and medicine. Besides having very unique structures, some of these molecules exhibit a broad range of pharmacological actions. In certain cases, high levels of effectiveness may be reached when the proper structural requirements are found.Scope of review: Here, we cover the fundamental biochemical mechanisms of some of these medicinal properties. We particularly focus on the beneficial activities of SFs and SGs in inflammation, hemostasis, vascular biology, and cancer.Major conclusions: In these clinical systems. intermolecular complexes directly driven by electrostatic interactions of SFs and SGs with P- and L-selectins, chemokines, antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, thrombin, factor Xa, bFGF, and VEGF, overall govern the resultant therapeutic effects. In spite of that, the structural features of SFs and SGs have shown to be essential determinants for formation and stability of those molecular complexes, which consequently account to the differential levels of the biomedical responses.General significance: Accurate structure-function relationships have mostly been achieved when SFs and SGs of well-defined structures are used for study. Therefore, these types of glycans have become of great usefulness to identify the chemical requirements needed to achieve satisfactory clinical responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

G-rich sequences are able to form quadruplex structures that have been proved to be involved in several important biological processes.Methods: In this paper, we report investigations, based on calorimetric, UV, CD and electrophoretic techniques, on 12 oligodeoxynucleotides analogues of the quadruplex forming human telomere sequence d[TA(G(3)T(2)A)(3)G(3)], in which each guanine has been replaced, one at a time, by an abasic site mimic.Results: Although all data show that the modified sequences preserve their ability to form quadruplex structures, the thermodynamic parameters clearly indicate that the presence of an abasic site decreases their thermal stability compared to the parent unmodified sequence, particularly if the replacement concerns one of the guanosines involved in the formation of the central G-tetrad.Conclusions: The collected data indicate that the effects of the presence of abasic site lesions in telomeric quadruplex structures are site-specific. The most dramatic consequences come out when this lesion involves a guanosine in the centre of a G-run.General significance: Abasic sites, by facilitating the G-quadruplex disruption, could favour the formation of the telomerase primer. Furthermore they could have implications in the pharmacological approach targeting telomere. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With rapid alterations of ecosystems occurring across the globe, organisms are being faced with sensory challenges that result in behavioural changes and disruptions with potential population-level consequences. Through a consideration of sensory ecology, it is possible to identify the underlying causes of disturbances at the individual level and use this information to develop better-informed, highly targeted, and more effective management strategies. Indeed, sensory-based approaches have already been successful in response to a variety of conservation issues. This article provides a general discussion of how a consideration of sensory ecology can benefit conservation biology and proceeds to describe three areas of rapid growth and potential for expansion: (1) mitigation of anthropogenic noise disturbance; (2) prevention and amelioration of ecological and other evolutionary traps; (3) targeted population control with special attention to aquatic invasive species.

Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations.

The focus in process improvement is often on understanding and manipulating the regulation of metabolism. Nonetheless, one encounters situations where organisms are remarkably resilient to further optimization or their properties become unstable. Therefore it is important to understand the origin of these apparent limitations to find whether and how they can be improved. We argue that by considering fitness effects of regulation, a more generic explanation for certain behaviour can be obtained. In this view, apparent process limitations arise from trade-offs that cells faced as they evolved to improve fitness. A deeper understanding of such trade-offs using a systems biology approach can ultimately enhance performance of cell factories.

The historical reduction in abundance and geographic distribution of the American plains bison (Bison bison bison) and their recovery over the last 125 years is well documented. However, introgression from domestic cattle (Bos taurus) into the few remaining bison populations that existed in the late 1800s has now been identified in many modern bison herds. We examined the phenotypic effect of this ancestry by comparing weight and height of bison with cattle or bison mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Santa Catalina Island, California (U.S.A.), a nutritionally stressful environment for bison, and of a group of age-matched feedlot bison males in Montana, a nutritionally rich environment. The environmental and nutritional differences between these 2 bison populations were very different and demonstrated the phenotypic effect of domestic cattle mtDNA in bison over a broad range of conditions. For example, the average weight of feedlot males that were 2 years of age was 2.54 times greater than that of males from Santa Catalina Island. In both environments, bison with cattle mtDNA had lower weight compared with bison with bison mtDNA, and on Santa Catalina Island, the height of bison with cattle mtDNA was lower than the height of bison with bison mtDNA. These data support the hypothesis that body size is smaller and height is lower in bison with domestic cattle mtDNA and that genomic integrity is important for the conservation of the American plains bison.

To identify virulence-associated genes to improve the biocontrol efficacy of M. acridum, it is necessary to understand the genes expressed by M. acridum during its infection of the insect host cuticle. In this study, we performed a large scale gene expression analysis of M. acridum during locust cuticle infection. We report the identification of 4,739 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 80 % have not been previously identified. Analysis of the ESTs provided evidence that M. acridum may employ several different adaptation strategies to infect locust cuticle, such as metabolism reprogramming, protein secretion, endocytosis, cell-cycle-regulated morphogenesis and effector-dependent suppression of host immune responses. By searching against the pathogen-host interaction database, several genes associated with different adaptation processes were found to potentially encode important virulence genes. Gene expression pattern analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that M. acridum differentially regulates subsets of genes in response to different infection niches between the host cuticle and hemolymph. The present study provides novel candidate genes to investigate the biology of insect infection by M. acridum.

However, data on the early stages of developing stereotypies are currently scarce. We compared the development of stereotypic route-tracing and somersaulting in hand-reared and wild-caught starlings placed in individual cages for the first time. We found that wild-caught birds were less active but showed more escape motivation and more evidence of route-tracing behavior. Furthermore, somersaulting was only observed in wild-caught birds. Development of somersaulting was predicted by subtle differences in behavior during the first few days in cages and developed in individuals with low levels of route-tracing behavior. Our data suggest a role for escape motivation in the development of starling stereotypies and additionally that route-tracing and somersaulting may represent alternative outlets for thwarted escape. In contrast to observations from mammals, our results show that stereotypies are more common in wild-caught starlings. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,Inc.

An intriguing aspect is the morphological and ecological similarity between H. pseudoalbidus and the native saprotroph Hymenoscyphus albidus. We revisited four localities where H. albidus apothecia were collected from 1989 to 2005 and established the current relationship of the species in these Danish ash stands based on microsatellites and differences in ITS sequences (used as CAPs marker). Scottish collections from 2010 supported the hypothesis that Danish herbarium samples prior to 2005 are identical to H. albidus still found in Scotland. The markers further revealed that herbarium samples from 1989 to 1994 were all H. albidus, while the latest collection (2005) was H. pseudoalbidus, which coincides with the first Danish symptom observations. Collections from 2010 were purely H. pseudoalbidus. We suggest that expanding H. pseudoalbidus excludes H. albidus from its niche resulting in H. albidus becoming a rare species in Denmark, which is perhaps already locally extinct.

A thorough knowledge of the biology of barnyardgrass is fundamental for designing effective resistance-management programmes. In the present study, seed production of barnyardgrass in response to time of emergence was investigated in cotton and rice, respectively, in Fayetteville and Rohwer, Arkansas, over a 2-year period (2008-09). Barnyardgrass seed production was greater when seedlings emerged with the crop, but some seed production was observed even if seedlings emerged several weeks after crop emergence. Moreover, barnyardgrass seed production was highly variable across environments. When emerging with the crop (0 weeks after crop emergence (WAE)), barnyardgrass produced c. 35500 and 16500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 39000 and 2900 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Seed production was observed when seedlings emerged up to 5 WAE (2008) or 7 WAE (2009) in cotton and up to 5 WAE (2008, 2009) in rice; corresponding seed production was c. 2500 and 1500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 14700 and 110 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The results suggest that cultural approaches that delay the emergence of barnyardgrass or approaches that make the associated crop more competitive will be useful in integrated management programmes. In the context of herbicide resistance management, it may be valuable to prevent seed return to the seedbank, irrespective of cohorts.

To address this challenge and maximize the return on the efforts required for validating genomic screen hits, the screening strategy must be designed to increase the robustness of the primary screening hits and include assays that inform on the mechanism of action of the knocked-down transcripts. Here, we describe the implementation of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify genes that sensitize the effect of poly-(ADP ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor on cell survival. In the strategy we designed for the primary screen, two biological activities, apoptosis and cell viability, were measured simultaneously at different time points in the presence and absence of a PARP inhibitor (PARPi).

The STARD1 (STARD1 and STARD3) and STARD4 subfamilies (STARD4-6) have an internal cavity large enough to accommodate sterols. To provide a deeper understanding on the structural biology of this domain, the binding of sterols to STARD5, a member of the STARD4 subfamily, was monitored. The SAR by NMR [H-1-N-15 heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC)] approach, complemented by circular dichroism (CD) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), was used. Titration of STARD5 with cholic (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), leads to drastic perturbation of the H-1-N-15 HSQC spectra and the identification of the residues in contact with those ligands.

There was a statistically significant bias in sex ratio toward females (Chi-square test, p<0.05) in both regions. The CCorrA resulted in a canonical correlation coefficient of 0.32 (p<0.00001). Both temperature and grain size composition of the sediment showed high correlation mainly with the presence of reproductive females, followed spermatophore-bearing males and recruits. In general, these demographic classes were most common in conditions of low temperature and fine sediments. These findings, as well as other studies carried out in colder regions with the same species, are consistent with the classical paradigm of lower longevity at lower latitudes. However, our results also suggest that this species maintained abiotic preference as populations located in cold temperate regions, mainly with temperature, indicating a different behavior from other shrimp species explored by fishery in the same region.

Previous works with Tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus (TBSV) revealed the recruitment of either peroxisomal or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes for replication. In case of Carnation Italian ringspot tombusvirus (CIRV), the mitochondrial membranes supported CIRV replication. In this study, we developed ER and mitochondrion-based in vitro tombusvirus replication assays. Using purified recombinant TBSV and CIRV replication proteins, we showed that TBSV could use the purified yeast ER and mitochondrial preparations for complete viral RNA replication, while CIRV preferentially replicated in the mitochondrial membranes. The viral RNA became partly RNase resistant after similar to 40 to 60 min of incubation in the purified ER and mitochondrial preparations, suggesting that assembly of TBSV and CIRV replicases could take place in the purified ER and mitochondrial membranes in vitro. Using chimeric and heterologous combinations of replication proteins, we showed that multiple domains within the replication proteins are involved in determining the efficiency of tombusvirus replication in the two subcellular membranes. Altogether, we demonstrated that TBSV is less limited while CIRV is more restricted in utilizing various intracellular membranes for replication. Overall, the current work provides evidence that tombusvirus replication could occur in vitro in isolated subcellular membranes, suggesting that tombusviruses have the ability to utilize alternative organellar membranes during infection that could increase the chance of mixed virus replication and rapid evolution during coinfection.

In order to keep the manufacturing process of the sensor simple, arrays of single split-ring-resonators are used. Two types of resonators, square and circular, are designed to cover different frequency ranges. An unknown material is then added as an overlayer to the metamaterial in order to explore the performance of the entire system in terms of sensing phenomenon. The changes in the transmission resonances are monitored upon variation of the thickness, the dielectric constant, and the coverage (distribution of the unknown material within each unit cell) of the overlayer. The results show good sensitivity of the sensors suggesting they can be used for a myriad of terahertz sensing applications in biology and chemistry.

Here, a comparative study between these proteomes was performed to find potential proteins and functions associated with human sperm maturation. Seven reproductive proteomes associated with human sperm physiology were integrated. Gene ontology analysis were performed using DAVID and Panther tools to determine enriched functions. Total of 270 proteins overlapped between epididymal, prostatic milieu and sperm proteome were thought to be candidate proteins involved in sperm maturation, and they showed enriched functions of proteasomal protein catabolic process and protein folding. 34 epididymal milieu proteins and 274 prostatic milieu proteins were contributed to the composition of seminal fluids proteome. Literatures have confirmed the involvements in sperm maturation of many of these proteins The spatial expressions of 24 epididymal milieu proteins involved in chaperone and antioxidant activity were authenticated by real-time RT-PCR. These proteins may serve as candidate molecules for future studies of sperm maturation and male infertility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LPL gene and to determine their associations between these polymorphisms and growth traits in Xiangxi cattle breed. In this study, six novel SNPs (C355157T, T355169C, T355186G, A355210G, T355348A and T355420C) and one reported SNP (A355427T, has been recorded in dbSNP, ID rs110590698) were detected using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing method. Genotyping and genetic diversity analysis were performed in 240 Xiangxi cattle on the basis of sequence alignment, which indicated that five SNPs (C355157T, 355186G, T355348A, T355420C, A355427T) were in abundant genetic diversity, and the other two SNPs (T355169C and TA355210G) were in low genetic diversity. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that 18 different haplotypes were identified in these animals. Moreover, the results of the association between LPL gene polymorphisms and growth traits indicated that the individuals with H1H1 haplotype combination had higher BW and HG than those with other haplotype combinations (P < 0.05). The animals with CC genotype maintain higher mean values for BW than those with the CT and TT genotypes (P < 0.05) at T355420C locus. The animals with the AA genotype have lower mean values for WH, BL, HG and BW than those with the AT and TT genotypes at A355427T locus (P < 0.05).

In this study, we reported the cloning of an IKK homologue cDNA (designated as AmphiIKK) from amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri. The full-length cDNA consists of 3,087 bp with an ORF that encoded a predicted protein of 777 amino acid residues. The putative amphioxus IKK protein possesses the characteristic organization of the mammalian IKK proteins, which consists of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a leucine zipper motif and a putative helix-loop-helix motif. And the deduced amino acid of AmphiIKK shared 43.8-64.0 % similarity and 23.6-43.3 % identified with the IKKs from other species. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that AmphiIKK was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and we also discovered that the expression of AmphiIKK was affected after lipopolysaccharides stimulation. Our findings help to highlight a potential important regulatory pathway in the innate immune response in the amphioxus and the evolution of the IKK family.

We examine the evolutionary relationships within the subfamily Halictinae (""sweat bees"") to investigate the origins of social behaviour within the tribe Halictini. We present a new phylogeny of the subfamily Halictinae based on three nuclear genes (elongation factor-1 alpha, wingless, and long-wavelength rhodopsin) and one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c oxidase 1) sequenced for 206 halictine bees. We use model-based character reconstruction to infer the probability of a shared eusocial ancestor for the genera Halictus and Lasioglossum, the two genera of Halictini which display eusociality. Our results suggest a high probability for a single origin of eusociality for these two genera, contradicting earlier views of separate origins within each taxon. Fossil-calibrated divergence estimates place this ancestor at approximately 35 million years ago, about 14 million years earlier than previous estimates of eusocial origins in the halictid bees.

Olive knot is present wherever olive is grown; although losses are difficult to assess, it is assumed that olive knot is one of the most important diseases of the olive crop. The last century witnessed a large number of scientific articles describing the biology, epidemiology and control of this pathogen. However, most P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi strains are highly recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which has effectively prevented the pathogen from benefitting from the scientific progress in molecular biology that has elevated the foliar pathogens of the P.?syringae complex to supermodels. A number of studies in recent years have made significant advances in the biology, ecology and genetics of P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi, paving the way for the molecular dissection of its interaction with other nonpathogenic bacteria and their woody hosts. The selection of a genetically pliable model strain was soon followed by the development of rapid methods for virulence assessment with micropropagated olive plants and the analysis of cellular interactions with the plant host. The generation of a draft genome of strain NCPPB 3335 and the closed sequence of its three native plasmids has allowed for functional and comparative genomic analyses for the identification of its pathogenicity gene complement. This includes 34 putative type III effector genes and genomic regions, shared with other pathogens of woody hosts, which encode metabolic pathways associated with the degradation of lignin-derived compounds. Now, the time is right to explore the molecular basis of the P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoiolive interaction and to obtain insights into why some pathovars like it necrotic and why some like it knot. Synonyms Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi. Taxonomy Kingdom Bacteria; Phylum Proteobacteria; Class Gammaproteobacteria; Family Pseudomonadaceae; Genus Pseudomonas; included in genomospecies 2 together with at least P.?amygdali, P.?ficuserectae, P.?meliae and 16 other pathovars from the P.?syringae complex (aesculi, ciccaronei, dendropanacis, eriobotryae, glycinea, hibisci, mellea, mori, myricae, phaseolicola, photiniae, sesami, tabaci, ulmi and certain strains of lachrymans and morsprunorum); when a formal proposal is made for the unification of these bacteria, the species name P.?amygdali would take priority over P.?savastanoi. Microbiological properties Gram-negative rods, 0.40.8?x?1.03.0?mu m, aerobic. Motile by one to four polar flagella, rather slow growing, optimal temperatures for growth of 2530?degrees C; oxidase negative, arginine dihydrolase negative; elicits the hypersensitive response on tobacco; most isolates are fluorescent and levan negative, although some isolates are nonfluorescent and levan positive. Host range P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi causes tumours in cultivated and wild olive and ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Although strains from olive have been reported to infect oleander (Nerium oleander), this is generally not the case; however, strains of P.?savastanoi pv. nerii can infect olive. Pathovars fraxini and nerii are differentiated from pathovar savastanoi mostly in their host range, and were not formally recognized until 1996. Literature before about 1996 generally names strains of the three pathovars as P.?syringae ssp. savastanoi or P.?savastanoi ssp.savastanoi, contributing to confusion on the host range and biological properties. Disease symptoms Symptoms of infected trees include hyperplastic growths (tumorous galls or knots) on the stems and branches of the host plant and, occasionally, on leaves and fruits. Epidemiology The pathogen can survive and multiply on aerial plant surfaces, as well as in knots, from where it can be dispersed by rain, wind, insects and human activities, entering the plant through wounds. Populations are very unevenly distributed in the plant, and suffer drastic fluctuations throughout the year, with maximum numbers of bacteria occurring during rainy and warm months. Populations of P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi are normally associated with nonpathogenic bacteria, both epiphytically and endophytically, and have been demonstrated to form mutualistic consortia with Erwinia toletana and Pantoea agglomerans, which could result in increased bacterial populations and disease symptoms. Disease control Based on preventive measures, mostly sanitary and cultural practices. Integrated control programmes benefit from regular applications of copper formulations, which should be maintained for at least a few years for maximum benefit. Olive cultivars vary in their susceptibility to olive knot, but there are no known cultivars with full resistance to the pathogen.

Several components of body composition variability (fat/lean ratio, fat distribution, lean mass composition and metabolism, and adipose tissue biology) are increasingly linked with cardiometabolic risk and vary substantially across ethnic groups. Constituents of lean mass are proposed to contribute to metabolic capacity, a generic trait favouring the maintenance of homeostasis. Adiposity is proposed to contribute to metabolic load, which at higher levels challenges metabolic homeostasis, elevating cardiometabolic risk. Ethnic differences in body composition, representing different load-capacity ratios, may therefore contribute to ethnic variability in cardiometabolic risk. Ecological and evolutionary factors potentially contributing to ethnic variability in body composition are explored. In contemporary populations, clinicians encounter an increasing range of ethnicity, along with many individuals of mixed-ethnic ancestry. Increasing understanding of the contribution of body composition to cardiometabolic risk may reduce the need to treat ethnic groups as qualitatively different. A conceptual model is proposed, treating insulin sensitivity and stroke risk as composite functions of body composition variables. Operationalizing this model may potentially improve the ability to assess cardiovascular risk across the full ethnicity spectrum, and to predict cardiometabolic consequences of excess weight gain.

Experiments with different strengths of Hoaglands solution showed that all three pathogens survived at a broad range of EC levels for at least 3 days and were stimulated to grow and sporulate at ECs > 1.89 dS m-1. Recovery of initial populations after a 14-day exposure was over 20% for P. alni subsp. alni and P. kernoviae, and 61.3% and 130% for zoospores and sporangia of P. ramorum, respectively. Zoospore survival of these pathogens at ECs < 0.41 dS m-1 was poor, barely beyond 3 days in pure water; only 0.3% (P. alni), 2.9% (P. kernoviae) and 15.1% (P. ramorum) of the initial population survived after 14 days at EC = 0.21 dS m-1. The variation in rates of survival at different EC levels suggests that these pathogens survive better in cropping systems than in irrigation water. Containment of run-off and reduction in EC levels may therefore be non-chemical control options to reduce the risk of pathogen spread through natural waterways and irrigation systems.

There have, however, been few studies of the variation of pollen traits, especially variation of pollen size. Here, we describe the morphology of pollen grains from Pachycereus weberi, paying particular attention to variation of the diameter of the grains. We found that pollen grains from P. weberi are spheroidal, isopolar, and tricolpate, with microperforate and spinulate tectum and visible perine. Pollen diameter is highly variable.

These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.

We propose that use of the developing embryonic femur as a model to further understand skeletogenesis, and the effects of key differentiation agents, will aid our understanding of the developing bone niche and inform bone reparation. We have used a three-dimensional organotypic culture system of embryonic chick femora to investigate the effects of two key skeletal differentiation agents, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), on bone and cartilage development, using a combination of microcomputed tomography and histological analysis to assess tissue formation and structure, and cellular behavior.Stimulation of embryonic day 11 (E11) organotypic femur cultures with PTH and PTHrP initiated osteogenesis. Bone formation was enhanced, with increased collagen I and STRO-1 expression, and cartilage was reduced, with decreased chondrocyte proliferation, collagen II expression, and glycosaminoglycan levels.This study demonstrates the successful use of organotypic chick femur cultures as a model for bone development, evidenced by the ability of exogenous bioactive molecules to differentially modulate bone and cartilage formation. The organotypic model outlined provides a tool for analyzing key temporal stages of bone and cartilage development, providing a paradigm for translation of bone development to improve scaffolds and skeletal stem cell treatments for skeletal regenerative medicine.

Optimization of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles of biotherapeutics is crucial for clinical, as well as commercial, success of these drugs. This review focuses on the common questions and challenges in ADME optimization of biotherapeutics for inflammatory conditions. For these immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive biotherapeutics, special consideration should be given to the assessment of the interdependency of ADME profiles, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships, and immunogenicity profiles across various preclinical species and humans, including the interdependencies both in biology and in assay readouts. The context of usage, such as dosing regimens, extent of disease, concomitant medications, and drug product characteristics may have a direct or indirect (via modulation of immunogenicity) impact on ADME profiles of biotherapeutics. Along these lines, emerging topics include assessments of preexisting reactivity to a biotherapeutic agent, impact of immunogenicity on tissue exposure, and analysis of penetration to normal versus inflamed tissues. Because of the above complexities and interdependences, it is essential to interpret PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody results in an integrated manner. In addition, because of the competitive landscape in autoimmune and inflammatory markets, many pioneering ADME-centric protein engineering and subsequent in vivo testing (such as optimization of novel modalities to extend serum and tissue exposures and to improve bioavailability) are being conducted with biotherapeutics in this therapeutic area.

Their use, however, is often limited by availability of plant resources and may jeopardize rare species of medicinal plants. Plant cell cultures can serve as a renewable source of valuable secondary metabolites. To the date, however, only few examples of their commercial use are known. The main reasons for such a situation are the insufficient production of secondary metabolites and high cultivation costs. It is possible to increase the performance of plant cell cultures by one or two orders of magnitude using traditional methods, such as selection of highly productive strains, optimization of the medium composition, elicitation, and addition of precursors of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The progress in molecular biology methods brought about the advent of new means for increasing of the productivity of cell cultures based on the methods of metabolic engineering. Thus, overexpression of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the synthesis of the target product or, by contrast, repression of these genes significantly influences the cell biosynthetic capacity in vitro. Nevertheless, the attempts of the production of many secondary metabolites in plant cell culture were unsuccessful so far, probably due to the peculiarities of the cell culture as an artificial population of plant somatic cells. The use of plant organ culture or transformed roots (hairy root) could turn to be a considerably more efficient solution for this problem. The production of plant-derived secondary metabolites in yeast or bacteria transformed with plant genes is being studied currently. Although the attempts to use metabolic engineering methods were not particularly successful so far, new insights in biochemistry and physiology of secondary metabolism, particularly in regulation and compartmentation of secondary metabolite synthesis as well as mechanisms of their transport and storage make these approaches promising.

Recent data, however, suggests that two categories can be distinguished on basis of molecular and clinical data, i.e. the high grade neuroendocrine (NE) carcinomas and the carcinoid tumors.Bronchial carcinoids and SCLCs may originate from the same pulmonary NE precursor cells, but a precursor lesion has only been observed in association with carcinoids, termed diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. The occurrence of mixed tumors exclusively comprising high grade NE carcinomas also supports a different carcinogenesis for these two groups. Histopathologically, high grade NE lung tumors are characterized by high mitotic and proliferative indices, while carcinoids are defined by maximally 10 mitoses per 2 mm(2) (10 high-power fields) and rarely have Ki67-proliferative indices over 10%. High grade NE carcinomas are chemosensitive tumors, although they usually relapse. Surgery is often not an option due to extensive disease at presentation and early metastasis, especially in SCLC. Conversely, carcinoids are often insensitive to chemo- and radiation therapy, but cure can usually be achieved by surgery.A meta-analysis of comparative genomic hybridization studies performed for this review, as well as gene expression profiling data indicates separate clustering of carcinoids and carcinomas. Chromosomal aberrations are much more frequent in carcinomas, except for deletion of 11q, which is involved in the whole spectrum of NE lung tumors. Deletions of chromosome 3p are rare in carcinoids but are a hallmark of the high grade pulmonary NE carcinomas. On the contrary, mutations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene are restricted to carcinoid tumors.Many of the differences between carcinoids and high grade lung NETs can be ascribed to tobacco consumption, which is strongly linked to the occurrence of high grade NE carcinomas. Smoking causes p53 mutations, very frequently present in SCLCs and LCNECs, but rarely in carcinoids. It further results in other early genetic events in SCLCs and LCNECs, such as 3p and 17p deletions. Smoking induces downregulation of E-cadherin and associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Also, high grade lung NETs display higher frequencies of aberrations of the Rb pathway, and of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic routes. Carcinoid biology on the other hand is not depending on cigarette smoke intake but rather characterized by aberrations of other specific genetic events, probably including Menin or its targets and interaction partners. This results in a gradual evolution, most likely from proliferating pulmonary NE cells via hyperplasia and tumorlets towards classical carcinoid tumors.We conclude that carcinoids and high grade NE lung carcinomas are separate biological entities and do not comprise one spectrum of pulmonary NETs. This implies the need to reconsider both diagnostic as well as therapeutic approaches for these different groups of malignancies. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) function as a master transcription factor, which regulates hypoxia responsive genes and has been recognized to play critical roles in tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemo-radiation resistance, and contributes to increased cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, tumor hypoxia with deregulated expression of HIF and its biological consequence lead to poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with solid tumors, resulting in higher mortality, suggesting that understanding of the molecular relationship of hypoxia with other cellular features of tumor aggressiveness would be invaluable for developing newer targeted therapy for solid tumors. It has been well recognized that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic cells are associated with therapeutic resistance and contribute to aggressive tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and believed to be the cause of tumor recurrence. Interestingly, hypoxia and HIF signaling pathway are known to play an important role in the regulation and sustenance of CSCs and EMT phenotype. However, the molecular relationship between HIF signaling pathway with the biology of CSCs and EMT remains unclear although NF-kappa B, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Notch, Wnt/beta-catenin, and Hedgehog signaling pathways have been recognized as important regulators of CSCs and EMT. In this article, we will discuss the state of our knowledge on the role of HIF-hypoxia signaling pathway and its kinship with CSCs and EMT within the tumor microenvironment. We will also discuss the potential role of hypoxia-induced microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor development and aggressiveness, and finally discuss the potential effects of nutraceuticals on the biology of CSCs and EMT in the context of tumor hypoxia.

Since then, the anti-apoptotic activity of BAG3 has been confirmed in other tumor types, where it has been shown to regulate the intracellular concentration and localization of apoptosis-regulating factors, including NF-kappa B-activating (IKK gamma) and Bcl2-family (Bax) proteins. Furthermore, growing evidences support its role in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia response to therapy. Moreover in the last years, the contribution of BAG3 to autophagy, a process known to be involved in the pathogenesis and response to therapy of leukemia cells, has been disclosed, opening a new avenue for the interpretation of the role of this protein in leukemias' biology.

Both the names ascorbic acid and vitamin C reflect its antiscorbutic properties due to its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues. Ascorbate acts as an electron-donor keeping iron in the ferrous state thereby maintaining the full activity of collagen hydroxylases; parallel reactions with a variety of dioxygenases affect the expression of a wide array of genes, for example via the HIF system, as well as via the epigenetic landscape of cells and tissues. In fact, all known physiological and biochemical functions of ascorbate are due to its action as an electron donor. The ability to donate one or two electrons makes AscH(-) an excellent reducing agent and antioxidant. Ascorbate readily undergoes pH-dependent autoxidation producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the presence of catalytic metals this oxidation is accelerated. In this review, we show that the chemical and biochemical nature of ascorbate contribute to its antioxidant as well as its prooxidant properties. Recent pharmacokinetic data indicate that intravenous (i.v.) administration of ascorbate bypasses the tight control of the gut producing highly elevated plasma levels; ascorbate at very high levels can act as prodrug to deliver a significant flux of H2O2 to tumors. This new knowledge has rekindled interest and spurred new research into the clinical potential of pharmacological ascorbate. Knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms of action of pharmacological ascorbate bring a rationale to its use to treat disease especially the use of i.v. delivery of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant in the treatment of cancer.

Defining past range changes/fragmentations during interglacial periods may provide tools to understand possible impacts of global warming on present biodiversity. To test this assumption we studied a marker gene in the bush-cricket Poecilimon birandi, a species confined to South-west Anatolia that demands a cold climate. Haplotypes of P. birandi constituted three main phylogroups,West, East and Demre. All haplotypes are unique to the respective phylogroup. An AMOVA suggested considerable divergence at all hierarchical levels. Though there is a strong isolation between phylogroups, the East and West groups harbour considerable haplotype diversity. Most of the demographic analyses suggest stable historical populations for the West and East phylogroups, but a coalescent-based demographic analysis indicates a bottleneck for the West phylogroup. The main conclusions are; (i) P. birandi contains considerable phylogenetic signal in 16S rDNA, (ii) there were at least three contemporaneous radiations, which might have originated from isolated refugial populations during Pleistocene, (iii) within a refugium, range changes induced by climatic shifts may be only vertical through an altitudinal gradient, (iv) significant genetic structure can arise in a small heterogeneous area, if the species requires particular habitats and has weak dispersal ability, (v) climatic shifts may cause fragmentation or extinction of populations, but can also lead to divergence of populations suffering from fragmentation, and (vi) altitudinal heterogeneity plays a buffering role, allowing for survival of the refugial biodiversity.

The transition from hPSC into committed differentiated cells is accompanied by secretome activity, remodeling of extracellular matrix and self-organization into germ layers. In this work, we aimed to investigate how different three-dimensional microenvironments regulate the early differentiation of the three germ layers in human embryonic stem (hES) cells derived embryoid bodies. In particular, a permeable, biocompatible, hydrogel microwell array was specifically designed for recreating a confined niche in which EB secreted molecules accumulate in accordance with hydrogel diffusional cut-off. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique was performed to accurately evaluate hydrogel permeability, mesh size and diffusional cutoff for soluble molecules. Three different culture conditions of EB culture were analyzed: suspension, confinement in microwells of width/depth ratio 1:1 and 1:2. Results show that EBs cultured in microwells are viable and have comparable average size after 8 days culture. Whole genome microarrays show that significative differential gene expression was observed between suspension and confined EBs culture. In particular, EBs culture in microwells promotes the expression of genes involved in pattern specification processes, brain development, ectoderm and endoderm differentiation. On the contrary, suspension EBs express instead genes involved in mesoderm specification and heart development. These results suggest that local accumulation of EBs secreted molecules drives differentiation patterns, as confirmed by immunofluorescence of germ layer markers, in hydrogel confined EB culture from both hES cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. Our findings highlight an additional potential role of biomaterial in controlling hPSC differentiation through secreted factor niche specification. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 31193132.

Using an exogenous regulator, irrE, from the radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans, we previously showed that a novel global regulator engineering (GRE) approach significantly enhanced tolerances of Escherichia coli to alcohol and acetate stresses. In this work, an irrE library was subjected to selection under various stresses of furfural, a typical hydrolysate inhibitor. Three furfural tolerant irrE mutants including F1-37 and F2-1 were successfully obtained. The cells containing these mutants reached OD600 levels of 4- to 16-fold of that for the pMD18T cells in growth assay under 0.2% (v/v) furfural stress. The cells containing irrE F1-37 and F2-1 also showed considerably reduced intracellular oxygen species (ROS) levels under furfural stress. Moreover, these two irrE mutants were subsequently found to confer significant cross tolerances to two other most common inhibitors, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF), vanillin, as well as real lignocellulosic hydrolysates. When evaluated in LuriaBertani (LB) medium supplemented with corn stover cellulosic hydrolysate (prepared with a solid loading of 30%), the cells containing the mutants exhibited lag phases markedly shortened by 2444?h in comparison with the control cells. This work thus presents a promising step forward to resolve the inhibitor problem for E. coli. From the view of synthetic biology, irrE can be considered as an evolvable part for various stresses. Furthermore, this GRE approach can be extended to exploit other exogenous global regulators from extremophiles, and the native counterparts in E. coli, for eliciting industrially useful phenotypes.

HA/ZrO2 composite powder prepared by using powder of HA and ZrO2 with different proportions sintered at 1600 degrees C were compared with pure HA powder and pure ZrO2 powder. The effects of the composite powder suspensions on the proliferation of the rabbit MSCs were measured by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assay), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were measured by the ALP colorimetric assay, and the cellular expression levels of Collagen I, osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNAs were determined by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The HA phase was transformed into the beta-Ca-3(PO4)(2)(beta-TCP), alpha-Ca-3(PO4)(2) and CaZrO3 phases in the composite powder after sintering at 1600 degrees C, with a positive correlation between the contents of the HA phase and the new phases. The MIT assay showed that both pure HA powder and HA containing composite powder were able to promote cellular proliferation, but pure ZrO2 powder had no effect in stimulating cell proliferation (P < 0.05). Vonkossa staining revealed that the composites and pure HA powder were capable of reducing the percentages of positively stained cells. The ALP colorimetric assay demonstrated that the ALP activities of cells maintained in culture media with HA and HA containing composite powder were significantly higher than that of cells cultured in regular media or media containing pure ZrO2 (P < 0.05). RT-PCR results showed that the composite powder were able to stimulate the expression of Collagen I and osteocalcin. The HA/ZrO2 composite powder can also facilitate osteogenic differentiation.

Nrf2 is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1). To identify novel small molecules that will disturb Nrf2Keap1 binding and promote activation of the Nrf2- antioxidant response element pathway, we generated a quantum model based on the structures of known Nrf2- antioxidant response element activators. We used the quantum model to perform in silico screening on over 18 million commercially available chemicals to identify the structures predicted to activate the Nrf2- antioxidant response element pathway based on the quantum model. The top hits were tested in vitro, and half of the predicted hits activated the Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway significantly in primary cell culture. In addition, we identified a new family of Nrf2-antioxidant response element-activating structures that all have comparable activity to tBHQ and protect against oxidative stress and dopaminergic toxins in vitro. The improved ability to identify potent activators of Nrf2 through the combination of in silico and in vitro screening described here improves the speed and cost associated with screening Nrf2-antioxidant response element -activating compounds for drug development.

Inhibitors of QC are currently in development as potential therapeutics. The crystal structures of the potent inhibitor PBD150 bound to human and murine QC (hQC, mQC) have been described recently. The binding modes of a dimethoxyphenyl moiety of the inhibitor are significantly different between the structures, which contrasts with a similar Ki value. We show the conformation of PBD150 prone to disturbance by proteinprotein interactions within the crystals. Semi-empirical calculations of the enzymeinhibitor interaction within the crystal suggest significant differences in the dissociation constants between the binding modes. To probe for interactions in solution, a site-directed mutagenesis on hQC was performed. The replacement of F325 and I303 by alanine or asparagine resulted in a 800-fold lower activity of the inhibitor, whereas the exchange of S323 by alanine or valine led to a 20-fold higher activity of PBD150. The results provide an example of deciphering the interaction mode between a target enzyme and lead substance in solution, if co-crystallization does not mirror such interactions properly.

With the purpose of developing molecules with the highest probability for blocking the adverse effects of these two oncogenes, we designed AL622, which contains a quinazoline head targeted to EGFR and a linker that bridges it to the PP2-like structure for targeting c-Src. In case the entire molecule would not be capable of blocking c-Src, we designed AL622 to hydrolyze to an intact c-Src-targeting PP2 molecule. After confirming its binary c-Src-EGFR targeting potency of AL622, we analyzed its potency in isogenic NIH3T3 cells transfected with EGFR and HER2 and human breast cancer cells known to be dominated by c-Src function. The results showed that in EGFR/HER-2-driven cells, it was more potent than PP2 and its activity was in the same range as the latter in more c-Src-driven cells. Its ability to block motility and invasion was comparable with that of PP2 and corresponding combinations, indicating that AL622 could be a better antitumor agent in cells where c-Src and/or EGFR play a role.

The pathogen was identified based on bacteriological characteristics and pathogenicity tests and the identity of strains was confirmed by DAS ELISA and PCR amplification using primers CMM5/6 and PSA4/R. The strains showed homogeneity in biochemical and physiological properties. However, pathogenicity tests revealed differences in virulence that are presumably due to a loss of the pat-1 gene. Further strain characterization using DNA-based methods revealed a high diversity of the Serbian Cmm strains. Based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of five genes, Cmm strains were divided into seven groups. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern of a selection of strains supported the groupings based on trees of the kdpA/sdhA sequences. On the other hand, groupings made according to PFGE and MLST were not correlated to plasmid content in all cases. This study suggested that high genetic variability of the Serbian Cmm strains was detected both in MLST and PFGE analyses, and could have resulted either from new Cmm strains being introduced by seeds from different origins or as a consequence of an intraspecific hybridization process. In addition, this study proposed MLST as an efficient tool in epidemiological studies, population biology investigations and tracking the routes of transmission of pathogens. Four of the five house-keeping genes (kdpA, sdhA, ligA and gyrB) selected to characterize Cmm strains proved to be suitable for the MLST analysis.

However, the lack of standardized harvesting protocols has made regulation difficult. This, in combination with the impacts of oceanographic disturbances has resulted in some kelp populations being considerably reduced during the last decade. Consequently, harvest methods that maintain kelp resources are sorely needed if harvesting is to remain a viable industry in Chile. Here, experiments were done to identify sustainable methods for harvesting Macrocystis pyrifera along the coast of northern Chile. Three methods were compared with regard to their impacts on kelp populations; one that involves extracting half of the fronds from each individual in a population, one that involves extracting all the fronds from half of the individuals in a population, and a third that involves extracting all the fronds from all of the individuals in a population (i.e., the method currently used). Following this, populations were evaluated over a 2-month period to monitor re-growth of the remaining individuals and recruitment of new individuals, as well as changes in understory algal diversity and herbivore abundance. Our results indicate that removing half of the fronds from each individual in a population was the best method for maintaining the resource for future harvest because, it (1) maintains rapid growth of new fronds on the harvested individuals, (2) promotes recruitment of new individuals, and (3) reduces herbivore densities through physical abrasion.

This study seeks to understand how some biomaterials elicit anticoagulant responses from endothelial cells (ECs), whereas others do not. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to correlate the activity of four relevant signaling molecules [extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Akt, and I?B kinase (IKK)] with human umbilical vein EC secretion of prostacyclin and clotting time of whole blood in contact with these cells. Prostacyclin secretion was increased when JNK activity (mean of all time-points) was elevated and IKK activity at 30 min was reduced. In addition, the clotting time, R-time measured by thromboelastography, was increased (reduced coagulability) when activity of both ERK and JNK (mean of all time-points) were increased and when Akt activity was increased at longer contact times (2472 h after cell contact with material). Inhibition of each signaling molecule with subsequent testing for prostacyclin secretion and R-time confirmed the interrelationship between EC intracellular signaling and prostacyclin secretion. Generally, JNK inhibition decreased and IKK inhibition increased prostacyclin secretion. Inhibition of ERK or JNK generally increased coagulability, and Akt inhibition decreased the R-time of samples normally eliciting reduced coagulability. These findings increase our understanding of the signaling pathways involved in endothelial prostacyclin release and suggest targets for developing EC-seeded biomaterial surfaces that can minimize coagulation.

While effective vaccines against YF, JE and TBE are in widespread use, the development of a dengue vaccine has been hampered for a long time because of concerns of immunopathological consequences of vaccination. Phase III clinical trials with a recombinant chimeric live vaccine are now ongoing and will show whether the enormous problem of dengue can be resolved or at least reduced by vaccination in the future.Unprecedented details of the flavivirus particle structure have become available through the combined use of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy that led to novel and surprising insights into the antigenic structure of these viruses. Recent studies provided evidence for an important role of virus maturation as well as particle dynamics in virus neutralization by antibodies and thus added previously unknown layers of complexity to our understanding of flavivirus immune protection. This information is invaluable for interpreting current investigations on the functional activities of polyclonal antibody responses to flavivirus infections and vaccinations and may open new avenues for studies on flavivirus cell biology and vaccine design.

In this study, 668 residents from the islands around the Tucurui Dam were selected. Blood samples were collected for investigation of serological markers (HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBS, and anti-HCV) by enzyme immunoassays. HCV-positive subjects were tested using RT-PCR and RFLP for the identification of viral genotypes. Among the 668 subjects studied, 1.9% were HBsAg positive, 28% were total anti-HBc positive, and 41.9% were anti-HBs positive. The anti-HBs marker alone (vaccine response) was detected in 25.7% of the volunteers. Anti-HCV antibody was detected in 2.2% of the subjects and genotype 1 was the predominant genotype (70%). The results indicate an intermediate level of HBV and HCV endemicity in the region studied, as well as low HBV vaccination coverage. J. Med. Virol. 84:19071912, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

At a Workshop at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Orthopaedic Research Society, we reviewed the molecular, cellular, and tissue scale approaches to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the periosteum's regenerative potential as well as translational therapies engineering solutions inspired by its remarkable regenerative capacity. The entire population of osteoblasts within periosteum, and at endosteal and trabecular bone surfaces within the bone marrow, derives from the embryonic perichondrium. Periosteal cells contribute more to cartilage and bone formation within the callus during fracture healing than do cells of the bone marrow or endosteum, which do not migrate out of the marrow compartment. Furthermore, a current healing paradigm regards the activation, expansion, and differentiation of periosteal stem/progenitor cells as an essential step in building a template for subsequent neovascularization, bone formation, and remodeling. The periosteum comprises a complex, composite structure, providing a niche for pluripotent cells and a repository for molecular factors that modulate cell behavior. The periosteum's advanced, smart material properties change depending on the mechanical, chemical, and biological state of the tissue. Understanding periosteum development, progenitor cell-driven initiation of periosteum's endogenous tissue building capacity, and the complex structurefunction relationships of periosteum as an advanced material are important for harnessing and engineering ersatz materials to mimic the periosteum's remarkable regenerative capacity.

Drechsl. ex Dast., are important diseases of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. However, the population biology of C. sativus is still poorly understood. In this study, the genetic structure of three C. sativus populations, consisting of isolates sampled respectively from barley leaves (BL), barley roots (BR) and wheat roots (WR) in North Dakota, was analysed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 127 AFLP loci were generated among 208 C. sativus isolates analysed with three primer combinations. Gene diversity (H = 0.277-0.335) were high in all three populations. Genetic variation among C. sativus individuals within population accounted for 74%, whereas 26% of the genetic variation was explained among populations. Genetic differentiation was high (empty set PT = 0.261, corrected G ''(st)= 0.39), whereas gene flow (Nm) ranged from 1.27 to 1.56 among the three populations analysed. The multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) ((r) over bard = 0.0760.117) was moderate in C. sativus populations. Cluster analyses indicate that C. sativus populations differentiated according to the hosts (barley and wheat) and tissues (root and leaf) although generalists also exist in North Dakota. Crop breeding may benefit from combining genes for resistance against both specialists and generalists of C. sativus.

One hundred and eighty-four markers were chosen to determine genetic and genotypic diversity and to test the hypothesis of random mating and population differentiation of Rcc isolates. Among the 337 isolates collected, the overall gene diversity was moderate ((h) over cap = 0.216). The level of multilocus genotypic diversity was higher within populations than among them. All individuals had unique multilocus genotypes. Genetic differentiation was significant among populations in localities, but at a moderate level (theta = 0.12; P < 0.001), suggesting that gene flow is occurring among populations. The isolates from all twelve clusters produced by Structure were found in all local populations, although at different frequencies. Therefore, the inferred clusters did not represent geographical populations. Although the null hypothesis of random mating in Rcc populations was rejected, the high level of genotypic diversity suggests that the Rcc population structure appears to be generated by a mixed reproductive system including both asexual and sexual reproduction, along with a rather high migration rate.

Structural features responsible for the activity of the compounds were characterized by using physicochemical, topological, and electrotopological descriptors, calculated from the Molecular Design Suite software (V-life MDSTM 3.5). Correlations between the inhibitory activities (KDR and KDRcell) of aminopyrazolopyridine urea derivatives and the calculated descriptors were established through simulated annealing method. The best QSAR models generated from the study explain 89 and 88% of the variation in KDR and KDRcell inhibitory activities, respectively. Internal and external validation methods were used to evaluate the predictive capacity of the generated models. The significant cross-validated correlation coefficient (Q (2) > 0.6) and other statistical parameters suggest that the models exhibited considerable predictivity. The generated QSAR models divulge that factors related to lipophilicity and topological state of atoms in the molecule influences KDR and KDRcell inhibitory activities of aminopyrazolopyridine urea derivatives.A QSAR study has been performed on aminopyrazolopyridine urea derivatives which exhibited VEGFR kinase inhibitory activity, and the results derived show that the lipophilicity and the topological state of atoms in the molecule influences KDR and KDRcell inhibitory activities.

Metabolomics-a comprehensive study of global metabolites-has become a highly sensitive and powerful tool for biomarker discovery thanks to recent technological advances. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/TOF MS/MS)-based metabolomics approach was employed to investigate sera from galactosamine-treated rats to find potential biomarkers for acute liver injury. Hepatic damage was quantified by determining serum transaminase activity and in situ liver histological lesions. Principal component analysis in combination with coefficient of correlation analysis was used for biomarker selection and identification. According to the data, serum levels of several metabolites including glucose, amino acids, and membrane lipids were significantly modified, some of them showing a high correlation with the degree of liver damage determined by histological examination of the livers. In conclusion, this study supports that UPLC-MS/MS based serum metabolomics in experimental animal models could be a powerful approach to search for biomarkers for drug- or disease-induced liver injury.

Although data generated by different ""Omics"" technologies are usually considered and analyzed separately, their interrelation may offer a valuable opportunity for assessing the emerging 'integrated biology' concept. The overall strategy of analysis first investigated data pretreatment and variable selection for each dataset. Then, three multivariate analyses were applied to investigate the links between the abundance of metabolites and the expression of proteins collected on the same samples. Unfold principal component analysis and regularized canonical correlation analysis did not take into account the presence of groups of individuals related to the intervention study. On the contrary, the predictive MultiBlock Partial Least Squares method used this information. Regularized canonical correlation analysis appeared as a relevant approach to investigate of the relationships between the two datasets. However, in order to highlight the molecular compounds, proteins and metabolites, associated in interacting or common metabolic pathways for the experimental groups, MultiBlock partial least squares was the most appropriate method in the present nutritional case study.

The Network of Excellence EURRECA (EURopean micronutrient RECommendations Aligned) aims at harmonising micronutrient intake recommendations through population groups. The lack of proper markers of status for some micronutrients limits progress in this area: metabolomics could help identifying such new markers. We developed an original metabolomic strategy in order to monitor the largest fraction of a list of > 270 metabolites known to be influenced by the micronutrients of interest. To improve the coverage of these metabolites in plasma, a multi platform approach was performed using both liquid and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. A sample preparation protocol based on a three-step plasma fractionation has been set up, using both liquid and solid phase extractions. Four fractions were obtained containing respectively polar metabolites, neutral lipids, free fatty acids and polar lipids. Recoveries were determined using spiked plasma samples, and the advantages and drawbacks of the fractionation method compared to a commonly used single preparation step method were investigated in terms of metabolites detection and robustness. Fractionation improved coverage of the endogenous metabolome more than twice in terms of extracted features, allowing to identify 90 metabolites.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the central players in the regulation of gene expression, participating in many physiological processes. A comprehensive knowledge of miRNA expression in the human heart is essential for the understanding of myocardial function. The aim of this study was to compare the miRNA signature in human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. Agilent human miRNA arrays were used to indicate the miRNA expression signatures of the right atrial (n = 8) and ventricular (n = 9) myocardium of healthy individuals. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs) were used to validate the array results. DIANA-mirPath was used to incorporate the miRNAs into pathways. MiRNA arrays showed that 169 miRNAs were expressed at different levels in human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on the 169 dysregulated miRNAs showed that miRNA expression categorized two well-defined clusters that corresponded to human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. The qRT-PCR results correlated well with the microarray data. Bioinformatic analysis indicated the potential miRNA targets and molecular pathways. This study indicates that distinct miRNA expression signatures in human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. The findings provide a novel understanding of the molecular differences between human atrial and ventricular myocardium and may establish a framework for an anatomically detailed evaluation of cardiac function regulation.

From an applications perspective, it is desirable that second-generation bioenergy crops have lignin that is readily degraded by chemical pretreatments but still fulfill its biological role in plants. Because plants can tolerate large variations in lignin composition, often without apparent adverse effects, substitution of some fraction of the traditional monolignols by alternative monomers through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to tailor lignin in bioenergy crops. However, successful engineering of lignin incorporating alternative monomers requires knowledge about phenolic metabolism in plants and about the coupling properties of these alternative monomers. Here, we review the current knowledge about lignin biosynthesis and the pathways towards the main phenolic classes. In addition, the minimal requirements are defined for molecules that, upon incorporation into the lignin polymer, make the latter more susceptible to biomass pretreatment. Numerous metabolites made by plants meet these requirements, and several have already been tested as monolignol substitutes in biomimetic systems. Finally, the status of detection and identification of compounds by phenolic profiling is discussed, as phenolic profiling serves in pathway elucidation and for the detection of incorporation of alternative lignin monomers.

Conchologically driven species delineations in microgastropods (Carychiidae, Carychium)","Abstract: Valid taxonomic descriptions are paramount in evolutionary biology. Many date back centuries and are based on ambiguous morphological data. Microgastropods, in particular the taxon Carychiidae (Eupulmonata, Ellobioidea), demonstrate a paucity of informative conchological features. However, as exemplified by Carychium mariae Paulucci, 1878, their taxonomic classification is based almost entirely on these few features. Here we investigated the questionable taxonomic status of Carychium mariae combining DNA barcoding, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and conchological data. This taxon occurs in the Southern Alps, where it shows a sympatric distribution with two widely distributed members of Carychium-C. minimum Muller, 1774 and C. tridentatum (Risso, 1826). Our analyses do not support the species status of C. mariae. In contrast, DNA barcoding reveals a monophyletic grouping of C. minimum and C. mariae specimens with averaged intraspecific variability less than 3.2% (barcoding gap for Carychiidae). Hence, C. mariae is treated and should be regarded as a synonym of C. minimum, just representing a different morphotype. The differentiation and monophyletic status of C. tridentatum can be validated by showing an averaged interspecific variability of 5.9% to C. minimum. In general, we are critical of the sole use of conchological characters for microgastropod taxonomy and strongly recommend the implementation of molecular data (e.g., DNA barcoding) to reevaluate established species designations.

The SDS-PAGE investigations demonstrated that the molecular weight of the monomer unit is 62.5 kDa but the native-PAGE studies indicated that the mass of the enzyme is 240-250 kDa which proves the presence of a characteristic homo oligomer quaternary structure in solution phase. Optimal parameters of the enzyme activity were at pH 6.0 and 50 A degrees C. The enzyme showed little stability under pH 4.5 and above 60 A degrees C. The substrate specificity investigations indicated that the TfBXyl43 is an exo-glycosidase, hydrolyzing only xylobiose and -triose from the nonreducing end. Besides the enzyme shows very high specificity on the glycon part of the substrate, since it can only hydrolyze beta-d-xylopyranoside derivatives. The importance of hydrophobic interactions in the binding of the substrates are supported that the enzyme can hydrolize about four times more efficiently the artificial p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside substrate compared to the natural one, xylobiose. Furthermore we could detect transxylosidase activity both in the case of xylobiose and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside donors which is the first example among the inverting beta-d-xylosidases from T. fusca.

Although the general principles are understood, many details remain unclear. Specifically, protein folding rates are of interest because they dictate the rate of protein aggregation which underlies many human diseases. Here we offer predictions of protein folding rates and their correlation with folding nucleus sizes. We calculated free energies of the transition state and sizes of folding nuclei for 84 proteins and peptides whose other parameters were measured at the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between their unfolded and native states. We used the dynamic programming method where each residue was considered to be either as folded as in its native state or completely disordered. The calculated and measured folding rates showed a good correlation at the temperature mid-transition point (the correlation coefficient was 0.75). Also, we pioneered in demonstrating a moderate (-0.57) correlation coefficient between the calculated sizes of folding nuclei and the folding rates. Predictions made by different methods were compared. The established good correlation between the estimated free energy barrier and the experimentally found folding rate of each studied protein/peptide indicates that our model gives reliable results for the considered data set.

However, this theory remains unproven. Based on the common occurrence of enchondromas on routine knee MR imaging (2.9 %), one would expect to find displaced cartilage in the metaphysis of skeletally immature individuals on routine knee MR examinations if the above theory was to be supported.The electronic databases of a specialist orthopedic hospital and children's hospital were searched for skeletally immature patients who underwent MR imaging of the knee for a variety of indications. Individuals with Ollier disease or hereditary multiple exostoses were excluded. The MR images were subsequently reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist for evidence of displaced cartilage into the metaphysis.We reviewed 240 MR examinations of the knee that were performed in 209 patients. There were 125 MR studies in male and 115 MR examinations in female patients (age range: 5 months-16 years; median age: 13 years). In 97.1 %, the growth plates around the knee demonstrated a regular appearance. Seven cases (2.9 %) in six patients showed cartilage extension from the growth plate into the metaphysis, which remained in continuity with the growth plate. There were no cases of displaced cartilage into the metaphysis on MRI.Our study challenges the widely believed theory that enchondromas arise from displaced growth plate remnants.

This construal of the selected effects theory conflicts with the existence and ubiquity of neurobiological functions that are evolutionary novel, such as structures underlying reading ability. This conflict has suggested to some that, while the selected effects theory may be relevant to some areas of evolutionary biology, its relevance to neuroscience is marginal. This line of reasoning, however, neglects the fact that synapses, entire neurons, and potentially groups of neurons can undergo a type of selection analogous to natural selection operating over an evolutionary time scale. In the following, I argue that neural selection should be construed, by the selected effect theorist, as a distinct type of function-bestowing process in addition to natural selection. After explicating a generalized selected effects theory of function and distinguishing it from similar attempts to extend the selected effects theory, I do four things. First, I show how it allows one to identify neural selection as a distinct function-bestowing process, in contrast to other forms of neural structure formation such as neural construction. Second, I defend the view from one major criticism, and in so doing I clarify the content of the view. Third, I examine drug addiction to show the potential relevance of neural selection to neuroscientific and psychological research.

Because of the documented effects on these traits of the LEPR c.1987C>T polymorphism, the LEP and LEPR c.1987C>T polymorphisms and their interactions have been jointly investigated. The LEP gene sequencing has allowed the identification of 39 polymorphisms, eight of which are novel. Three intronic SNPs, LEP g.1382C>T, LEP g.1387C>T and LEP g.1723A>G, have been genotyped, and association analyses have been carried out.

Monocyte recruitment into the vessel wall is a rate-limiting step in atherogenesis. Death of macrophage-derived foam cells promotes lesion progression and the majority of acute complications of atherosclerotic disease (e. g., myocardial infarction) occur in lesions that are intensely infiltrated with monocyte-derived macrophages, underlining the critical roles monocytes and macrophages play in this complex chronic inflammatory disease. Recent Advances: A rapidly growing body of literature supports a critical role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the regulation of monocyte and macrophage (dys) function associated with atherogenesis and macrophage death in atherosclerotic plaque. Critical Issues: In this review we highlight the important roles of NADHP oxidase 4 recently identified in monocytes and macrophages and the role of ROS and (thiol) redox signaling in different aspects of monocytes and macrophage biology associated with atherosclerosis. Future Directions: Studies aimed at identifying the intracellular targets of ROS involved in redox signaling in macrophages and at elucidating the redox signaling mechanisms that control differentiation, activation, polarization, and death of monocytes and macrophages may ultimately lead to the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis.

One example is ovarian cancer, which colonizes the peritoneal cavity and especially the omentum. Our research indicates that the interaction of ovarian cancer cells with the omental microenvironment can activate a stress-kinase pathway involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4). A combination of clinical correlative and functional data suggests that MKK4 activation suppresses growth of ovarian cancer cells lodged in omentum. These findings prompted us to turn our focus to the cellular composition of the omental microenvironment and its role in regulating cancer growth. In this review, in addition to providing an overview of MKK4 function, we highlight a use for metastasis suppressors as a molecular tool to study cancer cell interaction with its microenvironment. We review features of the omentum that makes it a favorable microenvironment for metastatic colonization. In conclusion, a broader, evolutionary biology perspective is presented which we believe needs to be considered when studying the evolution of cancer cells within a defined microenvironment.

Because of its low dispersal potential and ease in capture, it has the potential to serve as a model species to investigate the effects of land cover change in the Neotropics on gene flow and population connectivity. To better understand aspects of B. variegatus biology, such as mating system and dispersal rates, we isolated and characterized 18 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Markers were tested using 32 B. variegatus individuals sampled from a site in northeastern Costa Rica. Each locus contained between three and 12 alleles, while mean expected and observed heterozygosity were equal to 0.72.

This progress has been spurred by the development of several learning principles and methods of instruction, including active learning, student-centered learning, collaborative learning, experiential learning, and problem-based learning. In the present paper, we suggest that these seemingly different strategies share important underlying characteristics and can be viewed as complimentary components of a broader approach to classroom instruction called transformational teaching. Transformational teaching involves creating dynamic relationships between teachers, students, and a shared body of knowledge to promote student learning and personal growth. From this perspective, instructors are intellectual coaches who create teams of students who collaborate with each other and with their teacher to master bodies of information. Teachers assume the traditional role of facilitating students' acquisition of key course concepts, but do so while enhancing students' personal development and attitudes toward learning. They accomplish these goals by establishing a shared vision for a course, providing modeling and mastery experiences, challenging and encouraging students, personalizing attention and feedback, creating experiential lessons that transcend the boundaries of the classroom, and promoting ample opportunities for preflection and reflection. We propose that these methods are synergistically related and, when used together, maximize students' potential for intellectual and personal growth.

The relationship between total length and weight for nine species (Amblyraja radiata, Dipturus batis-complex, Leucoraja fullonica, L. naevus, Raja brachyura, R. clavata, R. microocellata, R. montagui, and R. undulata) are provided for each sex and ICES ecoregion (when significantly different). Conversion factors for disc width to total length are provided. The lengths at first maturity and of the largest immature skates are reported for each sex, and the lengths at 50% maturity are estimated. Spatial differences in the length at maturity of R. clavata (females only) and L. naevus (both sexes) were observed. The lengths at maturity are discussed in relation to the results of earlier studies, and methodological differences are considered to have influenced reputed decreases in the length at maturity. A more standardized approach to collecting and reporting maturity information is required if potential spatial differences and temporal changes are to be investigated.

Recent studies have identified a new phenomenon involving the simultaneous generation of tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements, called chromothripsis. To understand the molecular consequences of these events, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of two prostate tumors exhibiting evidence of chromothripsis. We identified several complex fusion transcripts, each containing sequence from three different genes, originating from different parts of the genome. One such poly-gene fusion transcript appeared to be expressed from a chain of small genomic fragments. Furthermore, we detected poly-gene fusion transcripts in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, suggesting they may represent a common phenomenon. Finally in one tumor with chromothripsis, we identified multiple mutations in the p53 signaling pathway, expanding on recent work associating aberrant DNA damage response mechanisms with chromothripsis. Overall, our data show that chromothripsis can manifest as massively rearranged transcriptomes. The implication that multigenic changes can give rise to poly-gene fusion transcripts is potentially of great significance to cancer genetics. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

All of the cells subjected to ionizing radiations showed an increase of the activity of plasma membrane beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase and sialidase Neu3, in addition of the well known increase of activity of plasma membrane sphingomyelinase, under similar conditions. Human breast cancer cell line T47D was studied in detail. In these cells the increase of activity of beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase was parallel to the increase of irradiation dose up to 60 Gy and continued with time, at least up to 72 h from irradiation. beta-glucosidase increased up to 17 times and beta-galactosidase up to 40 times with respect to control. Sialidase Neu3 and sphingomyelinase increased about 2 times at a dose of 20 Gy but no further significant differences were observed with increase of radiation dose and time. After irradiation, we observed a reduction of cell proliferation, an increase of apoptotic cell death and an increase of plasma membrane ceramide up to 3 times, with respect to control cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of UVA irradiation on the stemness properties of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). Furthermore, we examined the UVA-antagonizing effects of L-cysteine ethylester hydrochloride (ethylcysteine) and elucidated its action mechanisms. The results of this study showed that UVA reduced the proliferative potential and stemness of hAMSCs, as evidenced by reduced proliferative activity in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and downregulation of OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, stemness-related genes. The mRNA level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a, but not HIF-2a was reduced by UVA. Moreover, the knockdown of HIF-1a using small interfering RNA (siRNA) for HIF-1a was found to downregulate stemness genes, suggesting that UVA reduces the stemness through downregulation of HIF-1a. In addition, we examined the mechanisms underlying the UVA-mediated effects and found that UVA induced production of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and that this effect was mediated through activation of activating protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B). The UVA effects were antagonized by ethylcysteine, and the effects were found to be mediated by reduced production of PGE2 through the inhibition of JNK and p42/44 MAPK. Taken together, these findings show for the first time that UVA regulates the stemness of hAMSCs and its effects are mediated by downregulation of HIF-1a via the activation of PGE2cAMP signaling. In addition, ethylcysteine may be used as an antagonizing agent to mitigate the effects of UVA. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 36813691, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S Background and Objective: To compare the levels of Selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized Selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. Material and Methods: Fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique. Between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the MannWhitney U-test. Results: Subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, S. sputigena and the Mitsuokella sp. Human Oral Taxon (HOT) 131 (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone CS002), while higher mean counts of Actinomyces gerencseriae and Streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Selenomonas sp. HOT 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. In the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of P.gingivalis and S.sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth = 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth = 3 mm) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, sites with probing depth of = 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. There were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of P.gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), S.sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and Selenomonas dianae (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone EW076) (r = 0.42, p < 0.05).

Active at neutral pH, they catalyze normal turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM) and are critical for maintaining tissue allostasis. Subtle coordination between MMP activity and its inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) insures ECM homeostasis. Loss of control of MMPs expression/activity in numerous pathologies usually associates with host response to injuries, facilitation of disease progression and significant tissue damage. In skeletal muscles, fragmentary knowledge of MMPsflIMPs regulation and function underscores the need for a better understanding of their role which may lead to therapeutic alternatives. This review presents the current knowledge of MMPs in the biology and pathology of skeletal muscles and puts into perspective therapeutic alternatives that could be challenged in experimental models or that might emerge from in depth investigation of MMPs/TIMPs status in neuromuscular diseases.

Through advanced analytical techniques, lipidomics is now emerging as a critical factor in our understanding of the pathology of a broad range of diseases. Recent Advances: During enzymatic or nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, the simple structure of an unsaturated fatty acid is converted to an oxylipidome, many members of which are electrophilic and form the reactive lipid species (RLS). This aspect of lipid biology is particularly important, as it directly connects lipidomics with proteomics through the post-translational modification of a sub-proteome in the cell. This arises, because the electrophilic members of the oxylipidome react with proteins at nucleophilic amino-acid residues and so change their structure and function to form electrophile-responsive proteomes (ERP). Critical Issues: Biological systems have relatively few but well-defined and mechanistically distinct pro-oxidant pathways generating RLS. Defining the ERPs and the mechanisms underlying their formation and action has been a major focus for the field of lipidomics and redox signaling. Future Directions: We propose that a unique oxylipidome can be defined for specific oxidants and will predict the biological responses through the reaction with proteins to form a specific ERP. In this review, we will describe the ERPs that modulate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protective pathways, including the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 and the promotion of cell death through interactions with mitochondria.

The underlying mechanisms for its functional change remain to be elucidated. Using 4T1 mammary tumor model that shares many characteristics with human breast cancer, particularly its ability to spontaneously metastasize to the lungs, we demonstrate that Gr-1+CD11b+ cells or myeloid derived suppressor cells are important mediators in TGF-beta regulation of mammary tumor progression. Depletion of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells diminished the antitumor effect of TGF-beta neutralization. Two mechanisms were involved: first, treatment with TGF-beta neutralization antibody (1D11) significantly decreased the number of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells in tumor tissues and premetastatic lung. This is mediated through increased Gr-1+CD11b+ cell apoptosis. In addition, 1D11 treatment significantly decreased the expression of Th2 cytokines and Arginase 1. Interestingly, the number and property of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells in peripheral blood/draining lymph nodes correlated with tumor size and metastases in response to 1D11 treatment. Our data suggest that the efficacy of TGF-beta neutralization depends on the presence of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells, and these cells could be good biomarkers for TGF-beta-targeted therapy.

Soils from mid-successional stages of balsam poplar and white spruce were separated into successive forest floor (Oe/Oa), buried organic horizons (BOHs), and mineral horizons; and water-extractable amino acid composition and concentration were determined by HPLC. The number, depth, and thickness of BOHs were highly variable across the landscape and among replicates of the same stand type, reflecting differences in terrace age, flood frequency, flood intensity, river channel position, vegetation inputs, and decomposition. BOHs generally had lower pH and bulk density, higher moisture content, and greater concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and roots than the surrounding mineral horizons. In each horizon of both successional stages, the soil amino acid pool was dominated by glutamic acid, glutamine, alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and histidine, which together accounted for approximately 80% of the total amino acids found. Despite the similar overall amino acid composition among the horizons, proportions of glutamine generally increased with depth and were generally greater in the mineral horizons than in the BOHs, suggesting root exudation or fine root turnover as an amino acid source. In both successional stages, amino acid concentrations were nearly always highest in the Oe/Oa horizon and rapidly decreased with depth. BOHs generally had greater amino acid concentrations than the surrounding mineral horizons in both successional stages, but amino acid concentrations in successive BOHs declined with depth in the soil profile, suggesting that although BOHs do remain as biological hot spots and potential nutrient reservoirs as far down as 60 cm depth, their importance declines over time.

Two sections of a large introductory biology course (>400 students/section) were zoned into a laptop-permitted and a laptop-free area. Two sections in which laptop users could sit anywhere served as the Control. There was no difference in the attendance (similar to 85%) or percentage of students using laptops (similar to 29%) between Zoned and Control sections. Academic performance, based on exam points earned, was not significantly different for paper users in Zoned and Control sections indicating laptop use did not impair the overall achievement of surrounding students. However, there was a correlation between exam performance and note taking preference: paper note takers scored significantly higher and laptop users scored significantly lower than predicted by pre-class academic indicators (p < 0.01, paired t-test). The majority of both laptop (64%) and paper users (82%) in the Zoned sections supported a policy restricting laptop use to specific areas. Thus, while we further investigate whether the relationship between laptop use and performance is correlative or causative, zoning is an effective method for accommodating both laptop users and paper note takers in the same lecture hall.

In addition, knowledge of the elastic modulus will allow design of substrates with relevant mechanical properties for in vitro investigations of cellular behavior. Previously, we have reported elastic modulus values for the anterior basement membrane and Descemet's membrane of the human cornea, the surfaces in contact with the epithelial and endothelial cells, respectively. We have completed the compliance profile of the stromal elements of the human cornea by obtaining elastic modulus values for Bowman's layer and the anterior stroma. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the elastic modulus, which is a measure of the tissue stiffness and is inversely proportional to the compliance. The elastic response of the tissue allows analysis with the Hertz equation, a model that provides a relationship between the indentation force and depth and is a function of the tip radius and the modulus of the substrate. The elastic modulus values for each layer of the cornea are: 7.5 +/- 4.2 kPa (anterior basement membrane), 109.8 +/- 13.2 kPa (Bowman's layer), 33.1 +/- 6.1 kPa (anterior stroma), and 50 +/- 17.8 kPa (Descemet's membrane). These results indicate that the biophysical properties, including elastic modulus, of each layer of the human cornea are unique and may play a role in the maintenance of homeostasis as well as in the response to therapeutic agents and disease states.

Generally, commercial AFM cantilevers, which have a sharp tip, are used for AFM experiments. In this review, we introduce micro-fabricated AFM cantilevers and show several applications for cell biology. In manipulation of samples on a cellular scale with a force of tens to hundreds of nano-Newtons, attempts have been made to secure the formation of covalent/non-covalent linkages between the AFM probe and the sample surface. However, present chemistry-based modification protocols of cantilevers do not produce strong enough bonds. To measure the tensile strength and other mechanical properties of actin-based thin filaments in both living and semi-intact fibroblast cells, we fabricated a probe with a hooking function by focused ion beam technology and used it to capture, pull and eventually break a chosen thin filament, which was made visible through fusion with fluorescent proteins.

Both principles involve an extreme value of the rate of entropy production in an open system at the steady state under non-equilibrium conditions.

There are two competing mechanisms of its internal working the indirect activation and the direct activation. In the absence of conclusive experimental data, we have used computational modeling to assess the properties of both mechanisms and their suitability to act as a biological switch. Since the two mechanisms form opposite poles of continuum of Bcl-2 molecular interaction models, we have constructed more general models including these two models as extreme cases. By studying the relationship between model parameters and the steady-state response we have found optimal interaction patterns which reproduce the behavior of the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch. Our results show, that stimulus-response ultrasensitivity is negatively affected by spontaneous activation of Bcl-2 effectors. We found that ultrasensitivity requires effectors activation, mediated by another subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins-activators. We have shown that the auto-activation of monomeric effector forms provides an ultrasensitivity enhancing feedback loop. Thorough robustness analysis revealed that the interaction pattern postulated in the direct activation hypothesis is able to conserve stimulus-response switching characteristics for wide range changes of its internal parameters. The robustness of the switch against the variation of the reaction parameter is strongly reduced for the intermediate hybrid model and even more for the indirect part of the models.

Currently available self-repairing architectures have, however, some limitations such as storage overhead required to prepare all possible rewiring strategies and temporal incorrectness caused by elongated repairing time. In this paper, we propose a novel self-repairing architecture for fast fault recovery with an efficient use of limited resources, which can be easily applied to real complex digital systems. The proposed architecture consists of three layers: a working layer, a control layer, and an interface layer. The working layer employs a hybrid scheme of using both redundant and empty cells with a newly devised self-test. This relieves the overhead of redundant cells required to be prepared in advance by considering every possible fault situation. In the control layer, an ordered assignment control is proposed. The order of working-priority of each processor that controls a normal cell in the working layer is predetermined. A faulty processor is detected by a majority decision among neighboring control processors and corrected by rearranging the order of working-priority. The interface layer connects an external PC for reprogramming. Through this fault recovery mechanism, the system can keep normal functioning under noisy environments. We implemented the proposed self-repairing architecture using an field-programmable gate array board with an application of a dot-matrix LED display and verified its robust operation. The proposed architecture can be widely used as a new platform for self-repairing systems.

Cellular systems maintain their robustness in the face of perturbations arising from environmental and genetic variations. By analogy to control engineering architectures, the complexity of modular structures within a cell can be attributed to the necessity of achieving robustness. To reveal such a biological design, the E. coli ammonia assimilation system is analyzed, which consists of complex but highly structured modules: the glutamine synthetase (GS) activity feedback control module with bifunctional enzyme cascades for catalyzing reversible reactions, and the GS synthesis feedback control module with positive and negative feedback loops. We develop a full-scale dynamic model that unifies the two modules, and we analyze its robustness and fine tuning with respect to internal and external perturbations. The GS activity control is added to the GS synthesis module to improve its transient response to ammonia depletion, compensating for the tradeoffs of each module, but its robustness to internal perturbations is lost. These findings suggest some design principles necessary for the synthesis of life.

However, current methodologies available for their preparations are not straightforward and take several hours of incubation time. In this paper, we describe a new filtration-assisted technique for covalent conjugation between the reactive functional groups of two different molecules (small or macromolecules). Compared to the current method, this new approach significantly reduces the total reaction time from several hours to just a few minutes. The technique has been used for the preparation of conjugates of a small molecule to a protein such as biotin-BSA conjugate or small molecules to a small molecule such as biotin-tyramine conjugate or protein-protein conjugation such as antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The procedure consists of filtering the reaction mixture multiple times through membrane micropores with the help of two syringes, which make the cross filtration process less laborious. The method saves time, allows conjugation of less than 1 mg protein and produces conjugates better than those obtained by the current methods. Although the present technique has been applied on some common conjugation methods, it provides a potentially general method, and may further be expanded for the synthesis of several other macromolecular conjugates.

Such work opens up new possibilities for language research on previously unsolvable problems, especially in areas where information from other sources may be lacking. I use phylogenetic methods to investigate Tasmanian languages. Existing materials are so fragmentary that scholars have been unable to discover how many languages are represented in the sources. Using a clustering algorithm which identifies admixture, source materials representing more than one language are identified. Using the Neighbor-Net algorithm, 12 languages are identified in five clusters. Bayesian phylogenetic methods reveal that the families are not demonstrably related; an important result, given the importance of Tasmanian Aborigines for information about how societies have responded to population collapse in prehistory. This work provides insight into the societies of prehistoric Tasmania and illustrates a new utility of phylogenetics in reconstructing linguistic history.

Here we present measurements on colloidal particles, which are confined in narrow channels on a substrate and interact with a barrier, which impedes the motion along the channel. The substrate of the particle is tilted in order for the particles to be driven towards the barrier and, if the energy gained by the tilt is large enough, surpass the barrier by thermal activation. We therefore study the influence of this barrier as well as the influence of particle interaction on the particle transport through such systems.

This technique is useful for molecular genetic analysis in cancer, stem cell, bacterial, non-invasive prenatal diagnosis in which many biologists are interested. This paper describes a self-priming compartmentalization (SPC) microfluidic chip platform for performing digital loop-mediated amplification (LAMP). The energy for the pumping is pre-stored in the degassed bulk PDMS by exploiting the high gas solubility of PDMS; therefore, no additional structures other than channels and reservoirs are required. The sample and oil are sequentially sucked into the channels, and the pressure difference of gas dissolved in PDMS allows sample self-compartmentalization without the need for further chip manipulation such as with pneumatic microvalves and control systems, and so on. The SPC digital LAMP chip can be used like a 384-well plate, so, the world-to-chip fluidic interconnections are avoided. The microfluidic chip contains 4 separate panels, each panel contains 1200 independent 6 nL chambers and can be used to detect 4 samples simultaneously. Digital LAMP on the microfluidic chip was tested quantitatively by using beta-actin DNA from humans. The self-priming compartmentalization behavior is roughly predictable using a two-dimensional model.

The present study therefore was to assess the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and direct current electric field (dcEF) on the growth and trafficking of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). It was found that EGF did not affect cell proliferation in cell-culture flasks. However, ASC proliferated at a higher rate in microfluidic devices with continuous infusion of EGF. Furthermore, we found that ASC migrated toward an EGF gradient in microfluidic devices. Moreover, we found that ASC tended to position perpendicularly to dcEF.

Surprisingly, these arrangements are not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively similar for different plants. Several abstract mathematical models invoking general principles like circular symmetry and mutual repulsion of plant organs reproduce these characteristic features of phyllotaxis. Two such models, belonging to the class of field models, are analyzed in the present study, they were introduced by Thornley (1975), and by Douady and Couder (1992). It is numerically demonstrated that in the limit of high organ density their bifurcation diagrams (""divergence spectrum"") are self-similar under rescaling of two model parameters. Field models are known to give the classically expected behaviour only if the positioning of primordia is controlled exclusively by next-neighbor interactions (Kunz, 1995). In the general case, the bifurcation diagram of such models is topologically different and phyllotactic sequences converging to non-noble irrational divergences are possible. It is discussed how in these systems self-similarity and scaling together with the Farey tree structure of the divergence spectrum lead to a universal selection of asymptotic divergences with periodic continued fraction expansion [a(1),a(2),...,a(N),(kappa(1),kappa(2),...,kappa(P)) over bar], where the overlining denotes infinite repetition. Moreover, it is argued that for solutions easily accessible during growth, divergences are favored where all numbers N, P, a(1),a(2),..., and kappa(1),kappa(2,)... are small, thereby selecting in particular the noble limit divergences of the classically observed unijugate phyllotactic sequences.

These molecules were considered specific for the immune system. Recently, however, they were also found in epithelial and mesenchymal noncancerous and cancerous tissues and cell lines. In this article, we report that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B and HCC specimens express APRIL and BAFF and their receptors BCMA and BAFFR, but not TACI; APRIL/BCMA is enhanced in HCC, compared with normal liver tissue. In contrast to previous reports, APRIL binding to BCMA decreases cell proliferation by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest, whereas BAFF has no effect on cell growth. HCC cells therefore represent a rare system in which these two ligands ( APRIL and BAFF) exert a differential effect and may serve as a model for specific APRIL/BCMA actions. We show that the effect of APRIL is mediated via BCMA, which does not activate the classical NF-kappa B pathway, whereas it induces a novel signaling pathway, which involves JNK2 phosphorylation, FOXO3A activation, and GADD45 transcription. In addition, JNK2 mediates the phosphorylation of Akt, which is activated but does not participate in the antiproliferative effect of APRIL. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that APRIL modifies genes specifically related to cell cycle modulation, including MCM2/4/5/6, CDC6, PCNA, and POLE2.

In early perceptual processing, the superior colliculus (SC) takes a leading role in integrating visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli in order to direct eye movements. The SC forms a representation of multisensory space through a layering of retinotopic maps which are sensitive to different types of stimuli. These eye-centered topographic maps can adapt to crossmodal stimuli so that the SC can automatically shift our gaze, moderated by cortical feedback. In this paper we describe a neural network model of the SC consisting of a hierarchy of nine topographic maps that combine to form a multisensory retinotopic representation of audio-visual space. Our motivation is to evaluate whether a biologically plausible model of the SC can localize audio-visual inputs live from a camera and two microphones. We use spatial contrast and a novel form of temporal contrast for visual sensitivity, and interaural level difference for auditory sensitivity. Results are comparable with the performance observed in cats where coincident stimuli are accurately localized, while presentation of disparate stimuli causes a significant drop in performance. The benefit of crossmodal localization is shown by adding increasing amounts of noise to the visual stimuli to the point where audio-visual localization significantly out performs visual-only localization. This work demonstrates how a novel, biologically motivated model of low level multisensory processing can be applied to practical, real-world input in real-time, while maintaining its comparability with biology.

As evidence emerges that angiogenesis has significant mechanistic complexity, therapeutic resistance and escape have become practical limitations to drug development. Here, we review the mechanisms by which dynamic changes occur in the tumor microenvironment in response to antiangiogenic therapy, leading to drug resistance. These mechanisms include direct selection of clonal cell populations with the capacity to rapidly upregulate alternative proangiogenic pathways, increased invasive capacity, and intrinsic resistance to hypoxia. The implications of normalization of vasculature with subsequently improved vascular function as a result of antiangiogenic therapy are explored, as are the implications of the ability to incorporate and co-opt otherwise normal vasculature.

By and large, the mechanisms of action for viral and cellular helicases are not known. Moreover, in some cases, enzymatic activity is not even required for their roles in virus biology. Recently, we showed that expression of the host nucleolar helicase DDX56 is important for infectivity of West Nile virus (WNV) particles. In the present study, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of this enzyme is essential for its role in assembly of infectious WNV virions. Over-expression of the capsid-binding region of DDX56 also reduces infectivity of WNV suggesting that interaction of DDX56 and capsid protein is an important step in the virion assembly pathway.

SPOT-blot peptide arrays were used to screen for the methyllysine-containing histone peptides that bind to MBT domains found in nine human proteins. Selected interactions were quantified using fluorescence polarization assays. We show that all MBT proteins recognize only monomethyllysine and/or dimethyllysine marks and provide evidence that some MBT domains recognize a defined consensus sequence while others bind in a promiscuous, non-sequence-specific manner.

How phospholipids are transported to and in-between mitochondrial membranes remained unclear. We identified Ups1, a yeast member of a conserved family of intermembrane space proteins, as a lipid transfer protein that can shuttle phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes. Lipid transfer required the dynamic assembly of Ups1 with Mdm35 and allowed conversion of phosphatidic acid to cardiolipin in the inner membrane. High cardiolipin concentrations prevented membrane dissociation of Ups1, leading to its proteolysis and inhibiting transport of phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin synthesis. Thus, intramitochondrial lipid trafficking may involve a regulatory feedback mechanism that limits the accumulation of cardiolipin in mitochondria.

These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits(2-6), and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits(1,7). Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed.

It has also been proposed that cell fusion causes cancer and contributes to its progression. These functions rely on a poorly understood ability of cell fusion to create new cell types. We suggest that this ability can be understood by considering cells as attractor networks whose basic property is to adopt a set of distinct, stable, self-maintaining states called attractors. According to this view, fusion of two cell types is a collision of two networks that have adopted distinct attractors. To learn how these networks reach a consensus, we model cell fusion computationally. To do so, we simulate patterns of gene activities using a formalism developed to simulate patterns of memory in neural networks. We find that the hybrid networks can assume attractors that are unrelated to parental attractors, implying that cell fusion can create new cell types by nearly instantaneously moving cells between attractors. We also show that hybrid networks are prone to assume spurious attractors, which are emergent and sporadic network states. This finding means that cell fusion can produce abnormal cell types, including cancerous types, by placing cells into normally inaccessible spurious states. Finally, we suggest that the problem of colliding networks has general significance in many processes represented by attractor networks, including biological, social, and political phenomena.

This is also true for models of a cell's electrical activity; even within a narrowly defined population there can be considerable variation in electrophysiological phenotype. Here, we describe a computational experimental approach for parameterizing a model of the electrical activity of a cell in real time. We combine the inexpensive parallel computational power of a programmable graphics processing unit with the flexibility of the dynamic clamp method. The approach involves 1), recording a cell's electrical activity, 2), parameterizing a model to the recording, 3), generating predictions, and 4), testing the predictions on the same cell used for the calibration. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our approach using a cell line (GH4C1). These cells are electrically active, and they display tonic spiking or bursting. We use our approach to predict parameter changes that can convert one pattern to the other.

The model is described by the diffusion coefficient (d(alpha)) and proliferation rate (r(alpha)) of the species alpha (alpha = 1,2 is the species label). Propagating wave front solutions in one dimension are investigated analytically and by numerical solutions. It is found that the wave profiles and wave speeds are determined by the speed parameters, v(alpha) equivalent to 2 root d(alpha)r(alpha), of the two species, and the phase diagrams for various inter-and intracompetitive scenarios are determined. The steady wave front speeds are obtained analytically via nonlinear dynamics analysis and verified by numerical solutions. The effect of the intermediate stationary state is investigated and propagating wave profiles beyond the simple Fisher wave fronts are revealed. The wave front speed of a species can display abrupt increase as its speed parameter is increased. In particular for the case in which both species are aggressive, our results show that the speed parameter is the deciding factor that determines the ultimate surviving species, in contrast to the case without diffusion in which the final surviving species is decided by its initial population advantage. Possible relations to the biological relevance of modeling cancer development and wound healing are also discussed.

A hallmark of late-stage apoptosis is nuclear fragmentation in which DNA is degraded to release nucleosomes with their associated histones. In this work, a method was developed for detecting and measuring nucleosome concentration in vitro with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The indirect procedure used a commercially available secondary antibody-superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particle complex as a contrast agent that bound to primary antibodies against nucleosomal histones H4, H2A and H2B. Using a multiple-echo spin-echo sequence on a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner, significant T-2 relaxation enhancement as a function of in vitro nucleosomal concentration was measured. In addition, clustering or aggregation of the contrast agent was demonstrated with its associated enhancement in T-2 effects. The T-2 clustering enhancement showed a complex dependence on relative concentrations of nucleosomes, primary antibody and secondary antibody + SPIO. The technique supports the feasibility of using MRI measurements of nucleosome concentration in blood as a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tool in the management of cancer.

The design of biological systems often employs structural information or structure-based protein design to successfully implement synthetic signaling circuits or for rewiring signaling flows. Here, we summarize the latest advances in using structural information for studying protein interaction and signaling networks, and in synthetic biology approaches. We then provide a perspective of how combining structural biology with engineered cell signaling modules-using additional information from quantitative biochemistry and proteomics, gene evolution, and mathematical modeling-can provide insight into signaling modules and the general design principles of cell signaling. Ultimately, this will improve our understanding of cell- and tissue-type-specific signal transduction.

Achieving this goal requires well-characterized components, modular implementation strategies, simulation across temporal and spatial scales and automatic compilation of high-level designs to low-level genetic parts that function reliably inside cells. Many of these steps are incomplete or only partially understood, and methods for integrating them within a common design framework have yet to be developed. Here, we address these challenges by developing a prototype framework for designing synthetic cells with prescribed population dynamics. We extend the genetic engineering of cells (GEC) language, originally developed for programming intracellular dynamics, with cell population factors such as cell growth, division and dormancy, together with spatio-temporal simulation methods. As a case study, we use our framework to design synthetic cells with predator-prey interactions that, when simulated, produce complex spatio-temporal behaviours such as travelling waves and spatio-temporal chaos. An analysis of our design reveals that environmental factors such as density-dependent dormancy and reduced extracellular space destabilize the population dynamics and increase the range of genetic variants for which complex spatio-temporal behaviours are possible. Our findings highlight the importance of considering such factors during the design process. We then use our analysis of population dynamics to inform the selection of genetic parts, which could be used to obtain the desired spatio-temporal behaviours. By identifying, integrating and automating key stages of the design process, we provide acomputational framework for designing synthetic systems, which could be tested in future laboratory studies.

However, deciphering the functional impact of microbial communities on host pathophysiology represents a formidable challenge, due to the heterogeneous distribution of chemical and microbial species within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Herein, we apply imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to localize metabolites from the interaction between the host and colonizing microbiota. This approach complements other molecular imaging methodologies in that analytes need not be known a priori, offering the possibility of untargeted analysis. Localized molecules within the GI tract were then identified in situ by surface sampling with nanodesorption electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (nanoDESI FTICR-MS). Products from diverse structural classes were identified including cholesterol-derived lipids, glycans, and polar metabolites. Specific chemical transformations performed by the microbiota were validated with bacteria in culture.

However, chemical reagents required in the lysis interfere with downstream molecular biology and often require removal after the step. Electrical lysis based on irreversible electroporation is a promising technique to prepare samples for genetic analysis due to its purely physical nature, fast speed, and simple operation. However, there has been no experimental confirmation on whether electrical lysis extracts genomic DNA from cells in a reproducible and efficient fashion in comparison to chemical lysis, especially for eukaryotic cells that have most of the DNA enclosed in the nucleus. In this work, we construct an integrated microfluidic chip that physically traps a low number of cells, lyses the cells using electrical pulses rapidly, then purifies and concentrates genomic DNA. We demonstrate that electrical lysis offers high efficiency for DNA extraction from both eukaryotic cells (up to, similar to 36% for Chinese hamster ovary cells) and bacterial cells (up to similar to 45% for Salmonella typhimurium) that is comparable to the widely used chemical lysis. The DNA extraction efficiency has dependence on both the electric parameters and relative amount of beads used for DNA adsorption. We envision that electroporation-based DNA extraction will find use in ultrasensitive assays that benefit from minimal dilution and simple procedures.

The main roles of the Menkes protein, ATP7A, are the delivery of copper to the secretory pathway and the export of excess copper from the enterocytes. The N-terminal domain of membrane protein ATP7A consists of six repetitive sequences of 60-70 amino acids (Mnk1-Mnk6) that fold into individual metal binding domains (MBDs) and bind a single copper ion in the reduced Cu-1 form via two cysteine residues. The structure of each individual MBD is known from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Here, we were interested in the stability and dynamics of each isolated MBD in their apo and holo forms and their interactions with the soluble metallochaperone HAH1 that delivers copper to ATP7A. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the MBDs under different conditions, we show that some MBDs (Mnk1 and Mnk5) present large root-mean-square deviations from initial structures or large root-mean-square fluctuations, and great care has to be taken in setting up the simulations. We propose that the first MBD, Mnk1, probably important in the transfer of copper between the metallochaperone and ATPase, could be stabilized by interactions with other MBDs, including a domain located in the loop between Mnk1 and Mnk2. An important result of this work is the apparent direct correlation between the difference in the fluctuations of the metal binding site loop in its apo and holo forms and the measured affinity of the MBD for copper. This difference decreases from Mnk1 to Mnk6, Mnk4, and Mnk2 in this order. The study of the exposure to the solvent of the metal and the residues of the metal binding loop of the MBDs also shows different behavior for each MBD. In particular, copper in serine-rich domain Mnk3 and largely fluctuating domain Mnk5 appears to be more solvent-exposed than in the other MBDs. In the second part of this work, we investigated the importance of electrostatics in the MBD-chaperone interactions using different docking programs. Mnk1 and Mnk4 present a large electrostatic dipole moment and large stabilizing interaction energies with HAH1 Finally, we propose a model structure of ATP7A from Mnk6 (E561) to P1413 based on the crystal structure of LpCopA and docking simulations.

However, many other kinds of processes contribute to evolutionary diversity. In vertical descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit is propagated by replication inside its own lineage. In what we call introgressive descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit propagates into different host structures and is replicated within these host structures. Thus, introgressive descent generates a variety of evolutionary units and leaves recognizable patterns in resemblance networks. We characterize six kinds of evolutionary units, of which five involve mosaic lineages generated by introgressive descent. To facilitate detection of these units in resemblance networks, we introduce terminology based on two notions, P3s (subgraphs of three nodes: A, B, and C) and mosaic P3s, and suggest an apparatus for systematic detection of introgressive descent. Mosaic P3s correspond to a distinct type of evolutionary bond that is orthogonal to the bonds of kinship and genealogy usually examined by evolutionary biologists. We argue that recognition of these evolutionary bonds stimulates radical rethinking of key questions in evolutionary biology (e.g., the relations among evolutionary players in very early phases of evolutionary history, the origin and emergence of novelties, and the production of new lineages). This line of research will expand the study of biological complexity beyond the usual genealogical bonds, revealing additional sources of biodiversity. It provides an important step to a more realistic pluralist treatment of evolutionary complexity.

Although several palliative treatments are available, there is currently no cure and patients generally die 10-15 y after diagnosis. Several promising approaches for HD therapy are currently in development, including RNAi and antisense analogs. We developed a complementary strategy to test repression of mutant HTT with zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) in an HD model. We tested a ""molecular tape measure"" approach, using long artificial ZFP chains, designed to bind longer CAG repeats more strongly than shorter repeats. After optimization, stable ZFP expression in a model HD cell line reduced chromosomal expression of the mutant gene at both the protein and mRNA levels (95% and 78% reduction, respectively). This was achieved chromosomally in the context of endogenous mouse HTT genes, with variable CAG-repeat lengths. Shorter wild-type alleles, other genomic CAG-repeat genes, and neighboring genes were unaffected. In vivo, striatal adeno-associated virus viral delivery in R6/2 mice was efficient and revealed dose-dependent repression of mutant HTT in the brain (up to 60%). Furthermore, zinc finger repression was tested at several levels, resulting in protein aggregate reduction, reduced decline in rotarod performance, and alleviation of clasping in R6/2 mice, establishing a proof-of-principle for synthetic transcription factor repressors in the brain.

Basic principles governing these search mechanisms remain poorly understood, and no study has provided direct visualization of single proteins searching for and engaging target sites. Here we use the postreplicative mismatch repair proteins MutS alpha and MutL alpha as model systems for understanding diffusion-based target searches. Using single-molecule microscopy, we directly visualize MutS alpha as it searches for DNA lesions, MutL alpha as it searches for lesion-bound MutS alpha, and the MutS alpha/MutL alpha complex as it scans the flanking DNA. We also show that MutL alpha undergoes intersite transfer between juxtaposed DNA segments while searching for lesion-bound MutS alpha, but this activity is suppressed upon association with MutS alpha, ensuring that MutS/MutL remains associated with the damage-bearing strand while scanning the flanking DNA. Our findings highlight a hierarchy of lesion- and ATP-dependent transitions involving both MutS alpha and MutL alpha, and help establish how different modes of diffusion can be used during recognition and repair of damaged DNA.

All materials respond in some way to an applied magnetic field, and iron-bearing minerals are sensitive to a range of environmental processes, which makes magnetic measurements extremely useful for detecting signals associated with environmental processes. Environmental magnetism has grown considerably since the mid 1970s and now contributes to research in the geosciences and in branches of physics, chemistry, and biology and environmental science, including research on climate change, pollution, iron biomineralization, and depositional and diagenetic processes in sediments to name a few applications. Magnetic parameters are used to routinely scan sediments, but interpretation is often difficult and requires understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry. Thorough examination of magnetic properties and of the environmental processes that give rise to the measured magnetic signal is needed to avoid ambiguities, complexities, and limitations to interpretations.

We describe how ambiguities can be resolved by use of combined techniques and demonstrate the power of environmental magnetism in enabling quantitative environmental interpretations.

Their mathematical formulation is important for the study of pattern formation in general and plays central roles in many fields of biology, such as ecology and morphogenesis. Here we show that Turing patterns may have a decisive role in shaping the abundance distribution of predators and prey living in patchy landscapes. We extend the original model proposed by Nakao and Mikhailov [Nat.

We identify patterns of species distribution displaying high degrees of apparent competition driven by Turing instabilities.

Here, we study the effects of crowding due to car density and driving fluctuations on the transport of vehicles. Using a microscopic model for traffic, we found that crowding can push car movement from a superballistic down to a subdiffusive state. The transition is also associated with a change in the shape of the probability distribution of positions from a negatively-skewed normal to an exponential distribution. Moreover, crowding broadens the distribution of cars' trap times and cluster sizes. At steady state, the subdiffusive state persists only when there is a large variability in car speeds.

We analyzed chromatin remodeling on next generation sequencing data from resting and activated T cells to determine a whole-genome chromatin remodeling landscape. We consider chromatin remodeling in terms of nucleosome repositioning which can be observed most robustly in long nucleosome-free regions (LNFRs) that are occupied by nucleosomes in another cell state. We found that LNFR sequences are either AT-rich or GC-rich, where nucleosome repositioning was observed much more prominently in GC-rich LNFRs - a considerable proportion of them outside promoter regions. Using support vector machines with string kernels, we identified a GC-rich DNA sequence pattern indicating loci of nucleosome repositioning in resting T cells. This pattern appears to be also typical for CpG islands. We found out that nucleosome repositioning in GC-rich LNFRs is indeed associated with CpG islands and with binding sites of the CpG-island-binding ZF-CXXC proteins KDM2A and CFP1. That this association occurs prominently inside and also prominently outside of promoter regions hints at a mechanism governing nucleosome repositioning that acts on a whole-genome scale.

CD73 has important regulatory functions in the extracellular metabolism of certain nucleoside monophosphates, in particular adenosine monophosphate, and has been linked to a number of pathological conditions such as cancer and myocardial ischaemia. Here, we present the crystal structure of a soluble form of human soluble CD73 (sCD73) at 2.2 angstrom resolution, a truncated form of CD73 that retains ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. With this structure we obtained insight into the dimerisation of CD73, active site architecture, and a sense of secondary modifications of the protein. The crystal structure reveals a conserved loop that is directly involved in the dimer-dimer interaction showing that the two subunits of the dimer are not linked by disulfide bridges. Using biophotonic microarray imaging we were able to confirm glycosylation of the enzyme and show that the enzyme is decorated with a variety of oligosaccharide structures.

Viral polymerases are also known to accept modified substrates, and this has proven crucial in the development of antiviral therapies. However, non-thermostable polymerases of bacterial origin, or engineered variants, that have similar substrate tolerance and could be used for synthetic biology purposes remain to be identified.We have identified the a subunit of Escherichia coli polymerase III (Pol III a) as a bacterial polymerase that is able to recognise and process as substrates several pyrophosphate-modified dATP analogues in place of its natural substrate dATP for template-directed DNA synthesis. A number of dATP analogues featuring a modified pyrophosphate group were able to serve as substrates during enzymatic DNA synthesis by Pol III a. Features such as the presence of potentially chelating chemical groups and the size and spatial flexibility of the chemical structure seem to be of major importance for the modified leaving group to play its role during the enzymatic reaction. In addition, we could establish that if the pyrophosphate group is altered, deoxynucleotide incorporation proceeds with an efficiency varying with the nature of the nucleobase.

As a method of synthesis, the reduction of gold(III) chloride complex ions using glucose as a reducing agent was carried out.

The optimal conditions inside the microreactor system (concentrations and the flow rate of components) were established as a results of kinetic measurements in the batch reactor. In these studies the rate constants of AuNPs formation (nucleation and growth) as a function of different reductant concentration as well as temperature were determined using UV-Vis spectrophotometry and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method. Experimentally obtained kinetic data gave us the chance to formulate the rate law of AuNPs formation which further was used to establish synthesis conditions.

We speculated that progestin-induced alterations in lipid biology confer resistance to chemotherapy. To examine the biology of lipid loaded breast cancer cells, we used a model of progestin-induced lipid synthesis. T47D (PR-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (PR-negative) cell lines were used to study progestin response. Oil red 0 staining of T47D cells treated with progestin showed lipid droplet formation was PR dependent, glucose dependent and reduced sensitivity to docetaxel. This protection was not observed in PR-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Progestin treatment induced stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) enzyme expression and chemical inhibition of SCD-1 diminished lipid droplets and cell viability, suggesting the importance of lipid stores in cancer cell survival. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of phospholipids from progestin-treated T47D cells revealed an increase in unsaturated fatty acids, with oleic acid as most abundant. Cells surviving docetaxel treatment also contained more oleic acid in phospholipids, suggesting altered membrane fluidity as a potential mechanism of chemoresistance mediated in part by SCD-1. Lastly, intact docetaxel molecules were present within progestin induced lipid droplets, suggesting a protective quenching effect of intracellular lipid droplets.

This is in contrast to mutations within a heparin-binding TB domain (TB5), which is downstream of the arg-gly-asp cell adhesion domain, which can cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) or Acromicric (AD) and Geleophysic Dysplasias (GD). WMS is characterized by short limbs, joint stiffness and ocular defects, whilst fibrillin-1 AD and GD have severe short stature, joint defects and thickened skin. We previously showed that TB5 binds heparin. Here, we show that the corresponding region of fibrillin-2 binds heparin very poorly, highlighting a novel functional difference between the two isoforms. This finding enabled us to map heparin/heparan sulfate binding to two sites on fibrillin-1 TB5 using a mutagenesis approach.

The relationship between specific antibiotic resistant bacteria and the genes they carry remains to be described. Few details are known about the ecology of antibiotic resistant genes and bacteria in food production systems, or how antibiotic resistance genes in food animals compare to antibiotic resistance genes in other ecosystems. Here we report the distribution of antibiotic resistant genes in publicly available agricultural and non-agricultural metagenomic samples and identify which bacteria are likely to be carrying those genes. Antibiotic resistance, as coded for in the genes used in this study, is a process that was associated with all natural, agricultural, and human-impacted ecosystems examined, with between 0.7 to 4.4% of all classified genes in each habitat coding for resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC). Agricultural, human, and coastal-marine metagenomes have characteristic distributions of antibiotic resistance genes, and different bacteria that carry the genes. There is a larger percentage of the total genome associated with antibiotic resistance in gastrointestinal-associated and agricultural metagenomes compared to marine and Antarctic samples. Since antibiotic resistance genes are a natural part of both human-impacted and pristine habitats, presence of these resistance genes in any specific habitat is therefore not sufficient to indicate or determine impact of anthropogenic antibiotic use. We recommend that baseline studies and control samples be taken in order to determine natural background levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria and/or antibiotic resistance genes when investigating the impacts of veterinary use of antibiotics on human health. We raise questions regarding whether the underlying biology of each type of bacteria contributes to the likelihood of transfer via the food chain.

Our previous study demonstrated that TLR9 signaling could enhance the tumor progression of human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We further showed that miR-574-5p was the mostly up-regulated miRNA in human lung cancer cells under TLR9 signaling by miRNA array analysis. Here we characterized the potential role of miRNA-574-5p in enhanced tumor progression induced by TLR9 signaling in human lung cancer. We confirmed that TLR9 signaling effectively elevated the expression of miR-574-5p in human lung cancer cells. Notably, we found that down-regulation of miRNA-5745p using miR-574-5p inhibitor in vitro or miR-574-5p sponge in vivo significantly abrogated the enhanced tumor progression induced by TLR9 signaling. Further studies showed that miR-574-5p was an important player associated with enhanced tumor progression of human lung cancer cells. Notably, we identified checkpoint suppressor 1 (Ches1) as the dominant direct target for miRNA-574-5p to confer the TLR9 signaling enhanced tumor progression. We revealed that overexpression of Ches1 significantly inhibited the cell cycle entry of human lung cancer cells. Finally, we revealed that the expression of miR-574-5p was positively correlated with TLR9 and reversely correlated with Ches1 in lung cancer patients.

We characterize near-cognate suppression of amber, opal and a quadruplet codon in common Escherichia coli laboratory strains and find that the PylRS/tRNAPyl orthogonal pair cannot completely outcompete contamination by natural amino acids.

The most common and severe form of alpha 1ATD is caused by the Z-variant and is characterized by the accumulation of alpha 1AT polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver leading to a severe reduction (>85%) of alpha 1AT in the serum and its anti-protease activity in the lung. In this organ alpha 1AT is critical for ensuring tissue integrity by inhibiting neutrophil elastase, a protease that degrades elastin. Given the limited therapeutic options in alpha 1ATD, a more detailed understanding of the folding and trafficking biology governing alpha 1AT biogenesis and its response to small molecule regulators is required. Herein we report the correction of Z-alpha 1AT secretion in response to treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), acting in part through HDAC7 silencing and involving a calnexin-sensitive mechanism. SAHA-mediated correction restores Z-alpha 1AT secretion and serpin activity to a level 50% that observed for wild-type alpha 1AT. These data suggest that HDAC activity can influence Z-alpha 1AT protein traffic and that SAHA may represent a potential therapeutic approach for alpha 1ATD and other protein misfolding diseases.

In a stochastic hydrodynamic approach for an active gel of finite thickness L, we calculate the mean square displacement of a particle. These particle displacements are governed by fluctuations in the velocity field. We characterize the short-time behavior when the gel is a solid as well as the limit of long times when the gel becomes a fluid and the particle shows simple diffusion. Active stresses together with local polar order give rise to velocity fluctuations that lead to characteristic behaviors of the diffusion coefficient that differ fundamentally from those found in a passive system: the diffusion coefficient can depend on system size and diverges as L approaches an instability threshold. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient becomes independent of the particle size in this case.

S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics that tracks race, ethnicity, and employment) to compute the representation ratios of persons employed in biology, chemistry, and medicine from 1968 to 2009 (inclusive). They derived the representation ratios by computing the ratio of the conditional probability that a member of a given group is employed in a specific skilled science field to the overall probability of employment in that field. Their analysis tested for differences in representation ratios among racial, gender, and ethnic groups and across time among those employed as biologists, chemists, and medical doctors.Results Representation ratios rose for white females, whose percentage increase in medicine was larger than for any other racial/ethnic group. The representation ratios fell for Hispanics in biology, chemistry, and medicine. The representation ratio rose for African Americans, whose highest percentage increase occurred in biology. Asian Americans, who had the highest representation ratios in all three disciplines, saw a decline in their relative representation in medicine.Conclusions The authors have demonstrated that all groups do not benefit equally from diversity initiatives and that competition across related fields can confound efforts to increase diversity in medicine.

The meeting focused on defining the interaction between virus, prevailing host physiology, microbiota, and innate and adaptive immune responses and how they combine to impact the outcome at the moment of potential viral transmission. Speakers examined the biology of HIV entry during transmission, innate and natural antiviral mechanisms at the mucosa, microbicide efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics, animal models, and opportunities for combining HIV prevention strategies. Other viral infection models both in vivo and in vitro were considered for the insights they provided into HIV transmission events.

Biology, clinical experience, and future prospects","Abstract: Clinical trials of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus primarily have been directed at the modification of a single major risk factor; however, in trials that enroll patients with and without diabetes, the absolute risk in CVD events remains higher in patients with diabetes. Efforts to reduce the macrovascular and microvascular residual risk have been directed toward a multifactorial CVD risk-factor modification; nonetheless, long-term complications remain high. Dual-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/gamma agonists may offer opportunities to lower macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus beyond the reductions achieved with conventional risk-factor modification. The information presented elucidates the differentiation of compound-specific vs class-effect properties of PPARs as the basis for future development of a new candidate molecule. Prior experience with thiazolidinediones, an approved class of PPAR gamma agonists, and glitazars, investigational class of dual-PPAR alpha/gamma agonists, also provides important lessons about the risks and benefits of targeting a nuclear receptor while revealing some of the future challenges for regulatory approval.

We analyzed records of 767 patients treated at Moffitt Cancer Center between January 2001 and December 2009 to evaluate the relationship between serum albumin (SA) at the time of presentation and overall survival (OS). Patients (median age of 69 years) were stratified into three groups based on SA concentration (=3.5, 3.64.0, and >4.0 g/dL). Two-thirds of the patients had low or intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-based risk for MDS. Median OS by SA concentration of =3.5, 3.64.0, and >4.0 g/dL was 11, 23, and 34 months, respectively (P < 0.005), whereas rate of acute myeloid leukemia progression was highest in patients with low SA (=3.5 g/dL). The SA level offered prognostic discrimination for outcomes within the lower and higher IPSS risk groups, as well as with the MD Anderson risk model. In multivariable analysis, SA was a significant independent co-variate for OS after adjustment for IPSS, age, serum ferritin, and transfusion dependence (hazard ratio = 0.8; 95% CI 0.60.9; P = 0.004). Our findings indicate that hypoalbuminemia is an independent prognostic biomarker that may serve as a surrogate representative of disease biology or comorbidities in patients with MDS. Am. J.

Long-term survival reaching 15% is achieved in less than 5% of patients who undergo surgery, and median survival is only 6 months in those with inoperable lesions. A deeper understanding of PDAC biologic characteristics as well as novel prognostic markers are therefore required to improve outcomes. Herein we report that BAG3, a protein with recognized anti-apoptotic activity, was expressed in 346 PDACs analyzed, but was not expressed in the surrounding nonneoplastic tissue. In a cohort of 66 patients who underwent radical resection (R0), survival was significantly shorter in patients with high BAG3 expression (median, 12 months) than in those with low BAG3 expression (median, 23 months) (P = 0.001). Furthermore, we report that BAG3 expression in PDAC-derived cell lines protects from apoptosis and confers resistance to gemcitabine, offering a partial explanation for the survival data. Our results indicate that BAG3 has a relevant role in PDAC biology, and suggest that BAG3 expression level might be a potential marker for prediction of patient outcome.

The analysis of the B-cell receptor of the malignant cells could contribute to a better understanding of the DLBCL biology. We studied the molecular features of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) rearrangements in 165 patients diagnosed with DLBCL not otherwise specified. Clonal IGH rearrangements were amplified according to the BIOMED-2 protocol and PCR products were sequenced directly. We also analyzed the criteria for stereotyped patterns in all complete IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ (V-D.J) sequences. Complete V-D-J rearrangements were identified in 130 of 165 patients. Most cases (89%) were highly mutated, but 12 sequences were truly unmutated or minimally mutated. Three genes, IGHV4-34, IGHV3-23, and IGHV4-39, accounted for one third of the whole cohort, including an over-representation of IGHV4-34 (15.5% overall). Interestingly, all IGHV4-34 rearrangements and all unmutated sequences belonged to the nongerminal center B-cell like (non-GCB) subtype. Overall, we found three cases following the current criteria for stereotyped heavy chain VH CDR3 sequences, two of them belonging to subsets previously described in CLL.

As an ideal complement to traditional techniques such as chromosome counting, the analysis of cytotype diversity in plant systems such as Sorbus provides primary investigation into the potential patterns and evolutionary implications of hybrid speciation.Ploidy was assessed by means of relative nuclear DNA content using propidium iodide flow cytometry in 474 Sorbus samples collected from 65 populations in southern Wales and South-West England. Statistical tests were applied to evaluate the utility of this technique to confidently discriminate ploidy in the genus.Flow cytometric profiles revealed the presence of four cytotypes (2x, 3x, 4x and 5x), confirming in many cases chromosome counts previously reported and demonstrating cytotype heterogeneity within specific Sorbus aggregates. Diploid cytotypes were restricted to the potential parental species and homoploid hybrids. Most of the samples processed were polyploid. The occurrence of the pentaploid cytotype had previously only been reported from a single specimen; it is now confirmed for two taxa occurring at different sites.Flow cytometry results obtained have proved useful in shedding light on the taxonomy of several controversial taxa and in confirming the presence of cytoypes which occur at very low frequencies. Notably, the coexistence of several cytotypes in Sorbus populations has probably been facilitated by the overlapping distribution of many of the species studied, which might also explain the high incidence of potential hybrid apomictic polyploids. These results will provide a solid baseline for molecular research aiming to better understand the genetic pathways controlling the formation and establishment of polyploid Sorbus.

Data were obtained from trap-nests placed in the field margin during two agricultural years (2008/2009 and 2009/2010). Females made an average of 7.55 cells per nest, and used leaves of at least three plant species to build their nests. Provisions of cells were principally of Asteraceae pollen. Adult emergence showed a bimodal pattern suggesting a facultative bivoltinism life cycle. Approximately, 30 % of all offspring failed to complete development to the adult stage and an additional 10 % were killed by natural enemies. These included parasitic wasps (Eulophidae: Melittobia and Horismenus), a cleptoparasite bee (Megachilidae: Coelioxys), and a bristle beetle (Meloidae: Tetraonyx).

Furthermore, the current invasive-biology paradigm postulates that having a generalist-food habit is key to the successful invasion of a novel community by exotic species. This study investigated how the invasive pike killifish, Belonesox belizanus, has succeeded in establishing exotic populations in Florida, USA despite having a feeding apparatus that is characteristic of a specialized piscivore (i.e., fish-eating fish). Pike killifish collected from their point of introduction in south Florida were (1) filmed using high speed video while feeding on live fish-and shrimp-prey to determine whether prey type affects prey-capture kinematics and then (2) subjected to a prey-selectivity experiment to determine which prey type (live fish or shrimp) the invasive pike killifish eats when both prey are available in the environment. Results indicated that (1) prey-capture kinematics were not affected by prey type, indicating that consumption of fish and shrimp prey was accomplished using a stereotypical feeding repertoire, and (2) pike killifish consumed fish and shrimp when both prey were available in the feeding environment. It is concluded that the invasive pike killifish has the ability to feed on alternative, locally available prey using its piscivorous feeding functional morphology and prey-capture kinematics. This study contributes a new perspective to our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie success of exotic fishes in invaded communities. That is, the ability of a functional-morphological specialist to utilize stereotypical prey-capture kinematics (= behavior) in consuming alternative, locally available prey types (= dietary flexibility) contributes to the establishment of invasive populations. It is evident that these functional specialists are not constrained in their diet, thus, enabling them dietary flexibility and enhancing their invasive potential.

The associated parameter estimation problem then requires a prior handling of the global identifiability question in a realistic experimental framework. The lack of a method able to solve this issue has indirectly encouraged the use of global sensitivity analysis to select the subset of parameters to estimate. Nevertheless, the links between these two global analyses are not yet fully explored. The present work reveals new bridges between sensitivity analyses and global non-identifiability, through the use of functions derived from the Sobol' high dimensional representation of the model output.

We proposed using embedded cytokine slow-releasing hydrogels to tune this balance toward a desirable final bone density. In this study we established a systems biology model, and quantitatively explored the combinatorial effects of delivered cytokines from hydrogels on final bone density. We hypothesized that: 1) bone regeneration was driven by transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix, which responded to released cytokines, such as Wnt, BMP2, and TGF beta, drove the development of osteoblast lineage, and contributed to bone mass generation; and 2) the osteoclast lineage, on the other hand, governed the bone resorption, and communications between these two lineages determined the dynamics of bone remodeling. In our model. Intracellular signaling pathways were represented by ordinary differential equations, while the intercellular communications and cellular population dynamics were modeled by stochastic differential equations. Effects of synergistic cytokine combinations were evaluated by Loewe index and Bliss index. Simulation results revealed that the Wnt/BMP2 combinations released from hydrogels showed best control of bone regeneration and synergistic effects, and suggested optimal dose ratios of given cytokine combinations released from hydrogels to most efficiently control the long-term bone remodeling. We revealed the characteristics of cytokine combinations of Wnt/BMP2 which could be used to guide the design of in vivo bone scaffolds and the clinical treatment of some diseases such as osteoporosis.

Here, we report a technique to construct spheroids utilizing 3D culture chips with a rapid and simple method for the replication of the surface structures of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold. The resultant spheroid culture chip made it possible to rapidly yield high numbers of the spheroids at a time as well as to obtain uniform spheroids with a narrow size distribution and to collect the spheroids easily and noninvasively. The most important feature of this spheroid culture chip is that it enables direct oxygen supply to the cells because the chip is made with only gas-permeable PDMS. When human hepatoma HepG2 cells were grown on the oxygen-permeable chips as a model for liver cells, the cellular growth was remarkably enhanced, and the anaerobic glycolysis was significantly reduced compared to the non-oxygen-permeable chips. Furthermore, the oxygen-permeable chip improved the albumin secretion rates compared to the conventional spheroid culture system after 10 days. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the oxygen-permeable chip dramatically prevented hypoxia in the core of the spheroids and subsequent central necrosis. Surprisingly, the diameters of approximately 400 and 600 mu m were estimated to be the threshold of the hypoxic and survival size, respectively, for the HepG2 spheroids in the oxygenated chip.

Although the cause remains unknown, misfolded protein aggregates are seen in neurons of sporadic ALS patients, and familial ALS mutations, including mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), produce proteins with an increased propensity to misfold and aggregate. A structure activity relationship of a lead scaffold exhibiting neuroprotective activity in a G93A-SOD1 mouse model for ALS has been further investigated in a model PC12 cellular assay. Synthesis of biotinylated probes at the N-1 nitrogen of the pyrazolone ring gave compounds (5d-e) that retained activity within 10-fold of the proton-bearing lead compound (5a) and were equipotent with a sterically less cumbersome N-1-methyl substituted analogue (5b). However, when methyl substitution was introduced at N-1 and N-2 of the pyrazolone ring, the compound was inactive (5c). These data led us to investigate further the pharmacophoric nature of the pyrazolone unit. A range of N-1 substitutions were tolerated, leading to the identification of an N-1-benzyl substituted pyrazolone (5m), equipotent with 5a. Substitution at N-2 or excision of N-2, however, removed all activity. Therefore, the hydrogen bond donating ability of the N-2-H of the pyrazolone ring appears to be a critical part of the structure, which will influence further analogue synthesis.

Complex biological and social networks have displayed presence of some triad motifs far in excess (or short) of their expected values. Some of these over(under)-represented motifs have explained the basic functionality of systems, for example, in the sensory transcription networks of biology, over-represented motifs are shown to perform signal processing tasks. This suggests purposeful, selective retention of these motifs in the studied biological systems. Another interesting feature is the high correlation of triad motif significance profiles (MSPs) of all systems that belong to a family of naturally grouped systems, thereby suggesting that all the systems in a family have the same function to perform and hence the correlation. Engineering systems also display over(under)-represented motifs. The MSPs of a family of naturally grouped engineering systems show high correlation. Unlike biological and social networks, engineering systems are designed by humans and offer an opportunity for investigation based on known design rules. We show that over(under)-represented motifs in engineering systems are not purposefully retained/avoided to perform functions but are a natural consequence of design by decomposition. We also discover that naturally grouped systems have remarkably correlated in(out) degree distribution across nodes resulting in a high correlation in MSP. Therefore, we argue that the idea of network motifs has no significance in engineering systems (unlike biological and other evolutionary systems), and we caution the engineering research community to be careful while drawing conclusions based on network motifs. We report a remarkable correlation of in(out) degree distribution of systems within a family of engineering systems. We further show that biological and social networks also display signs of decomposition. They also show a high correlation of inout degree distribution of nodes for systems within a family. This opens up an interesting opportunity to investigate these systems through their observed decomposition. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Despite this, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that might account for this relationship remain incompletely understood. A key challenge has been in distinguishing between a whole-body milieu of inflammation and oxidative stress from the ramifications of cell-specific resistance to insulin. Transgenic models have now begun to explore the cellular influences of insulin resistance on vascular biology, with novel implications for atherosclerosis across a range of cells including endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages and fibroblasts. Emerging data from these models have also begun to challenge conventional dogma. In particular, the findings across various cell types are disparate with some even implying a protective influence on vascular biology. We now review these data, highlighting recent advances in our understanding of cellular resistance to insulin as well as those areas where there remains a paucity of data.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the first 544 clinically significant isolates revealed high prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SXT) (30.7%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of 165 TMP-SXT-resistant isolates revealed a heterogeneous population. Multilocus sequence typing 'identified 7 STs from 9 identified PFGE clusters, which included separate PFGE clusters of fluoroquinolorie-resistant and -susceptible ST131 isolates. The majority of TMP-SXT resistant isolates (85.5%) were found to carry class 1 integrons, and plasmids from 62 (81%) of 77 representative isolates were successfully transformed into E. coil DH10B. Overall, ampicillin was the most common plasmid-encoded resistance phenotype transferred with TMP-SXT at 60% (37/62). Further characterization of 52 plasmids by restriction fragment length polymorphism and replicon typing revealed the presence of many plasmid lineages, suggesting that the elevated rates of TMP-SXT resistance in these communities are most likely attributed to the horizontal transfer of class 1 integrons. Results from this study emphasize the importance of continued surveillance of remote northern communities in order to optimize the efficacy of empiric UTI treatment.

Lifestyles of the pathogens extend from biotrophy to necrotrophy, obligate to facultative pathogenesis, and narrow to broad host ranges on plants or animals. Sequencing of several pathogens has revealed striking variation in genome size and content, a plastic set of genes related to pathogenesis, and adaptations associated with obligate biotrophy. Features of genome evolution include repeat-driven expansions, deletions, gene fusions, and horizontal gene transfer in a landscape organized into gene-dense and gene-sparse sectors and influenced by transposable elements. Gene expression profiles are also highly dynamic throughout oomycete life cycles, with transcriptional polymorphisms as well as differences in protein sequence contributing to variation. The genome projects have set the foundation for functional studies and should spur the sequencing of additional species, including more diverse pathogens and nonpathogens.

Despite significant progress in the understanding, the mechanisms and pathophysiology of AF treatments are often unsatisfactory. This in part may be related to the complexity of this arrhythmia, as well as its evolution overtime. Atrial fibrillation has many aetiologies and underlying causes. The anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) and interventions aimed at controlling AF should therefore be based on aetiology and associated conditions, rather than electrophysiological mechanisms. The current guideline in the management of AF in most part is based on safety and outcome. This review will discuss the approach to management, based on primary prevention of AF with the aim to target at risk factors, triggers, specific substrates related to aetiology rather than mechanisms. The development of new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies should consider not only evidence based, but also include patient-specific personalized context system biology and pharmacology; otherwise, we will continue to see moderate drug efficacy at best and negative results and outcomes.

Lunules are paired cup-like suckers that assist in securing attachment of the copepod parasite to its host. Although present in genera such as Caligus and Pseudocaligus, lunules are absent in other caligid genera such as Lepeophtheirus as well as in more primitive caligiforms such as members of the families Trebiidae and Dissonidae. We compared the morphology and development of the anterior margin of the frontal plates between two caligids, Pseudocaligus fugu and Lepeophtheirus sekii, and a more basal caligiform, Dissonus heronensis (a dissonid), using scanning electron, transmission electron, and laser confocal microscopes. Our observations suggest that the lunules originated as a modification of the marginal membranes of the ancestral frontal plates. We also demonstrated the presence of an anlagen cell population for the lunule and marginal membrane in the developing frontal plate. These primordial cells can be detected as early as the first stage of the chalimus phase. Based on these observations, an evolutionary scenario for the lunule is proposed based on cytological evidence. This case study enhances our understanding of evolutionary novelty, which is a main focus of contemporary evolutionary developmental biology.

In C57Bl/6 mice engineered to overexpress caveolin specifically in cardiac myocytes (Cav-3 OE), localization of caveolin to mitochondria increases membrane rigidity (4.2%; P<0.05), tolerance to calcium, and respiratory function (72% increase in state 3 and 23% increase in complex IV activity; P<0.05), while reducing stress-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (by 20% in cellular superoxide and 41 and 28% in mitochondrial superoxide under states 4 and 3, respectively; P<0.05) in Cav-3 OE vs. TGneg. By contrast, mitochondrial function is abnormal in caveolin-knockout mice and Caenorhabditis elegans with null mutations in caveolin (60% increase free radical in Cav-2 C. elegans mutants; P<0.05). In human colon cancer cells, mitochondria with increased caveolin have a 30% decrease in apoptotic stress (P<0.05), but cells with disrupted mitochondria-caveolin interaction have a 30% increase in stress response (P<0.05). Targeted gene transfer of caveolin to mitochondria in C57Bl/6 mice increases cardiac mitochondria tolerance to calcium, enhances respiratory function (increases of 90% state 4, 220% state 3, 88% complex IV activity; P<0.05), and decreases (by 33%) cardiac damage (P<0.05).

Here, we review translocation projects, both published and unpublished. Our results indicate that most projects (1) addressed fewer than half of the basic criteria established for translocations and (2) were either unjustifiable from a conservation perspective or inadequately designed to guarantee success or preclude negative consequences. We propose a hierarchical decision-making system - an explicit method that integrates existing guidelines, thereby covering a key gap in conservation science - to reduce ambiguity when deciding whether to implement a given translocation project. This method will improve the likelihood of success in translocation projects and contribute to the efficient use of the limited resources available for these conservation efforts.

In mammals, melatonin is the key hormonal relay for the photoperiodic message, governing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary stalk. TSH acts on neighbouring hypothalamic cells known as tanycytes, which in turn control hypothalamic function through effects on thyroid hormone (TH) signalling, mediated by changes in expression of the type II and III deiodinases (Dio2 and Dio3, respectively). Among seasonally breeding rodents, voles of the genus Microtus are notable for a high degree of sensitivity to nutritional and social cues, which act in concert with photoperiod to control reproductive status. In the present study, we investigated whether the TSH/Dio2/Dio3 signalling pathway of female common voles (Microtus arvalis) shows a similar degree of photoperiodic sensitivity to that described in other seasonal mammal species. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the plant metabolite 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (6-MBOA), described previously as promoting reproductive activation in voles, had any influence on the TSH/Dio2/Dio3 system. Our data demonstrate a high degree of photoperiodic sensitivity in this species, with no observable effects of 6-MBOA on upstream pituitary/hypothalamic gene expression. Further studies are required to characterise how photoperiodic and nutritional signals interact to modulate hypothalamic TH signalling pathways in mammals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells. Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world.

Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in endometrial cancer, they have primarily focused on a small set of known cancer genes and have thus provided a limited view of the molecular basis underlying this disease. Here we have developed an integrated systems-biology approach to identifying novel cancer genes contributing to endometrial tumorigenesis. We first performed whole-exome sequencing on 13 endometrial cancers and matched normal samples, systematically identifying somatic alterations with high precision and sensitivity. We then combined bioinformatics prioritization with high-throughput screening (including both shRNA-mediated knockdown and expression of wild-type and mutant constructs) in a highly sensitive cell viability assay. Our results revealed 12 potential driver cancer genes including 10 tumor-suppressor candidates (ARID1A, INHBA, KMO, TTLL5, GRM8, IGFBP3, AKTIP, PHKA2, TRPS1, and WNT11) and two oncogene candidates (ERBB3 and RPS6KC1). The results in the ""sensor"" cell line were recapitulated by siRNA-mediated knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines. Focusing on ARID1A, we integrated mutation profiles with functional proteomics in 222 endometrial cancer samples, demonstrating that ARID1A mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and are associated with PI3K pathway activation. siRNA knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines increased AKT phosphorylation supporting ARID1A as a novel regulator of PI3K pathway activity. Our study presents the first unbiased view of somatic coding mutations in endometrial cancer and provides functional evidence for diverse driver genes and mutations in this disease.

We identify 2489 putative melanocyte enhancer loci in the mouse genome by ChIP-seq for EP300 and H3K4me1. We demonstrate that these putative enhancers are evolutionarily constrained, enriched for sequence motifs predicted to bind key melanocyte transcription factors, located near genes relevant to melanocyte biology, and capable of driving reporter gene expression in melanocytes in culture (86%; 43/50) and in transgenic zebrafish (70%; 7/10). Next, using the sequences of these putative enhancers as a training set for a supervised machine learning algorithm, we develop a vocabulary of 6-mers predictive of melanocyte enhancer function. Lastly, we demonstrate that this vocabulary has genome-wide predictive power in both the mouse and human genomes. This study provides deep insight into the regulation of gene expression in melanocytes and demonstrates a powerful approach to the investigation of regulatory sequences that can be applied to other cell types.

Increases in average life span in the last century are the result of improved public health measures, and many diseases may be related to lifestyle choices. But animal research has contributed to understanding these factors and to the development of vaccines and lifesaving treatments.

The observed lengths at 50 % maturity were approximately 170 mm in standard length (SL) for females and 160 mm SL for males, which corresponded approximately to 3-year-old fish. The spawning season was estimated to take place from January to May, peaking from February to April, which closely coincided with the coldest water temperatures of the year. The lipidosomatic index of both sexes decreased from January onward and maintained low values until July, presumably as the fish expended energy to reproduce. Spawning intervals were estimated to occur between 1.3 and 1.8 days from February to April. Fecundity (F) for females tested using 69 ovaries was related to SL: F = 1.313 x 10(-4) x SL3.966. Histological observations and a fish market survey suggested that the species spawned in sandy muddy areas (< 20 m) based on the presence of mature individuals.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether Epo is detectable in the ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian tumors.Patients and Methods: We investigated the presence of Epo in the ascitic fluid of 100 women undergoing laparotomy for an ovarian tumor. Epo concentration was quantitated with an immunochemiluminometric assay.Results: Ten women had a benign tumor, 13 women had a borderline tumor, and 77 women had ovarian cancer. Epo was detected in all ascitic fluid samples, in similar amounts as in corresponding serum samples. Ascitic fluid Epo concentration did not differ between the 3 study groups (P = 0.081), but in multiple comparisons, ascitic fluid Epo was higher in the women with cancer than in the women with a benign tumor (P = 0.006). Ascitic fluid Epo concentration correlated positively with serum Epo (P < 0.0001) and the volume of ascites (P < 0.0001). In regression analyses, serum Epo, volume of ascites, blood hemoglobin, plasma CA125, tumor stage, tumor grade, and the presence of residual tumor after surgery had no significant independent effect on ascitic fluid Epo.Conclusion: Considerable amounts of Epo are present in the ascitic fluid of women with ovarian tumors.

However, nonmolecular synapomorphies are unclear, and more comparative data are needed to elucidate deep relationships within the order. In this article, pollen and tapetum characters are reevaluated in relation to recent hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships within clusioids. This is done to shed light on the evolution of pollen and tapetum, particularly the evolution of pollen dyads, and also to assess the potential utility of pollen and tapetal characters in the systematics of the clusioids. The comparative morphology of pollen and tapetum is examined in selected taxa from Bonnetiaceae (Bonnetia), Calophylaceae (Caraipa), Clusiaceae (Clusia, Garcinia), Hypericaceae (Hypericum), and Podostemaceae (Podostemum). Pollen and tapetum characters in clusioids and selected outgroups are tabulated, based on both original observations and an extensive literature search, and then optimized onto a recent molecular phylogeny. The optimizations indicate that unusual pollen dispersed as dyads has evolved from monads in the late-branching Podostemoideae (Podostemaceae) clade. Relatively small-sized pollen (E = 11-30 mu m) is a potential synapomorphy for Hypericaceae and Podostemaceae, supporting the putative sister relationship between these two families, and pollen with circular or elliptic endoapertures is a potential synapomorphy for Bonnetiaceae. Several pollen characters (size, shape, apertures, and sculpture) indicate that Weddellina (Weddellinoideae: Podostemaceae) is more closely related to Hypericaceae than are Tristichoideae. Irregular granular exines have arisen several times independently within clusioids. A high level of polymorphism occurs in pollen characters in Clusiaceae and is probably related to high levels of diversity in floral morphology, pollination mechanisms, and pollinators, particularly in Clusia and Garcinia. By contrast, pollen of Podostemoideae is relatively uniform, despite developmental differences in microsporogenesis type and the presence of dyads. This may reflect evolutionary canalization or convergent evolution in these enigmatic aquatic plants.

However, there is little peer-reviewed data available regarding the biological differences between fallback pigs and their normal cohorts. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to identify differences in the biology and physiology, and thus the growth and metabolism, between pigs with varying weaning weights (WW) and postweaning performance. To accomplish this objective, a total of 120 barrows (PIC C22/C29 x 337) were used in growth and comparative slaughter experiments. Pigs were selected from a population of 960 weanling pigs to represent the 10% lightest, median, and heaviest pigs at weaning (n = 40 pigs per WW category). Eight pigs from each WW category were harvested on d 5 postweaning as the initial slaughter group (ISG). The remaining 96 barrows were housed in individual crates, fed ad libitum quantities of a common diet during a 27-d growth study, and were harvested on d 33 or 34 postweaning. After the completion of the live animal component of the experiment, pigs within each WW category were further stratified into the slowest, median, or fastest 33% ADG categories. This resulted in a total of 9 treatments in a nested design. Fallback pigs were designated as those belonging to the slowest ADG category from either the lightest or median WW categories. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS with the fixed effects of WW category and WW(ADG). Although feed intake was maximized (P < 0.0001) by WW(ADG) category, feed efficiency was not different (P = 0.30). When equalized per unit of BW, WW(ADG) category greatly affected (P < 0.02) eviscerated carcass, organ, and metabolic BW, but not (P = 0.28) empty BW. There were no differences (P > 0.12) in tissue nutrient concentrations, ratios, or energy content among pigs in the growth experiment. All tissue deposition rates, which were calculated as the difference between tissue nutrient concentrations of the growth experiment and initial slaughter groups, were maximized (P < 0.0002) by WW(ADG), even when equalized per unit of BW. In conclusion, WW and ADG affect tissue accretion rates, but not feed efficiency or carcass composition in nursery pigs.

This property arises from the epithelial-like tight junctions within the brain capillary endothelium. The BBB is anatomically and functionally distinct from the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at the choroid plexus. Certain small molecule drugs may cross the BBB via lipid-mediated free diffusion, providing the drug has a molecular weight <400 Da and forms <8 hydrogen bonds. These chemical properties are lacking in the majority of small molecule drugs, and all large molecule drugs. Nevertheless, drugs can be reengineered for BBB transport, based on the knowledge of the endogenous transport systems within the BBB. Small molecule drugs can be synthesized that access carrier-mediated transport (CMT) systems within the BBB. Large molecule drugs can be reengineered with molecular Trojan horse delivery systems to access receptor-mediated transport (RMT) systems within the BBB. Peptide and antisense radiopharmaceuticals are made brain-penetrating with the combined use of RMT-based delivery systems and avidin-biotin technology.

At day 3 postischemia, alpha SMA+ cells were concentrated in two main loci within the ipsilateral hemisphere (Area A) in the medial corpus callosum and (Area B) midway through the striatum adjacent to the lateral ventricle. By day 7 and further by day 14, fewer alpha SMA+ cells remained in Areas A and B but a steady increase in the pen-infarct was observed. alpha SMA+ cells also expressed glial acidic fibrillary protein [GFAP: alpha SMA+/GFAP+ (29%); alpha SMA+/GFAP- (71%) phenotypes] and feline leukemia virus C receptor 2 (FLVCR2), but not ED1(microglia) and established markers of pericytes normally located in vascular wall. alpha SMA+ cells were also located close to the subventricular zones (SVZ) adjacent to Areas A and B. In conclusion, alpha SMA+ cells have been identified in a spatial and temporal sequence from the SVZ, at intermediate loci and in the vicinity of the pen-infarct. It is hypothesized that novel populations of alpha SMA+ precursors of pericytes are born on the SVZ, migrate into the pen-infarct region and are incorporated into new vessels of the pen-infarct regions.

In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, TLR7 ligation vigorously accelerated tumor progression and induced loss of expression of PTEN, p16, and cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21, p27, p53, c-Myc, SHPTP1, TGF-beta, PPAR gamma, and cyclin B1. Furthermore, TLR7 ligation induced STAT3 activation and interfaced with Notch as well as canonical NF-kappa B and MAP kinase pathways, but downregulated expression of Notch target genes. Moreover, blockade of TLR7 protected against carcinogenesis. Since pancreatic tumorigenesis requires stromal expansion, we proposed that TLR7 ligation modulates pancreatic cancer by driving stromal inflammation. Accordingly, we found that mice lacking TLR7 exclusively within their inflammatory cells were protected from neoplasia. These data suggest that targeting TLR7 holds promise for treatment of human pancreatic cancer.

The innate immune proteins in the yolk of embryos are of maternal origin. Maternal stress affects the maternal-to-embryo transfer of these proteins and, therefore, environmental stressors may change the course of embryo development, including embryonic immunocompetency, via their deleterious effect on maternal physiology. This review focuses on the associations that exist between maternal stress, maternal endocrine disturbance and the responses of the acellular innate immune proteins of early-stage fish embryos. Early-stage teleostean embryos are dependent upon the adult female for the formation of the zona pellucida as an essential barrier defence, for their supply of nutrients, and for the innate immunity proteins and antibodies that are transferred from the maternal circulation to the oocytes; maternally derived hormones are also transferred, some of which (such as cortisol) are known to exert a suppressive action on some aspects of the immune defences. This review summarizes what is known about the effects of oocyte cortisol content on the immune system components in early embryos. The review also examines recent evidence that embryonic cells during early cleavage have the capacity to respond to increased maternal cortisol transfer; this emphasizes the importance of maternal and early immune competence on the later life of fishes, both in the wild and in intensive culture.

Oxidative stress biomarkers and EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, Cyp1A enzyme) activity were used as indicators of possible environmental stress and stable isotopes as determinants of diet and trophic position. Latvian S. salar stocks Daugava and Gauja had distinct stable-isotope signatures compared to the other stocks, indicating differences in migration patterns, residency or arrival times, or dietary specialization among stocks. Salmo salar originating from Daugava and Gauja also had lower catalase enzyme activity than the other stocks. Post-smolts originating from rivers of the Gulf of Finland had elevated EROD activities compared to fish of the same age from Bothnian Bay rivers, which could indicate exposure to organochlorine pollutants. No other stock-specific differences in oxidative stress biomarkers were found. The study demonstrates how genetic, oxidative stress biomarker, EROD and stable-isotope data may be combined to study trophic position, prey prevalence and environmental stress of mixed S. salar stocks foraging in the sea.

Maturity and reproductive status were assessed from histological sections of ovaries (n = 234) and testes (n = 243) of fish caught in commercial longline and recreational fisheries between 2006 and 2009. Spawning peaked in the Coral Sea during November and December at sea surface temperatures between 24.8 and 28.3 degrees C. Lower jaw fork length (L-LJF) at 50% maturity (L-LJF50), a key variable for stock assessment, was estimated to be 2100 +/- 102 mm (mean + s.e.) for females and 1668 +/- 18 mm for males. Unlike large pelagic tunas Thunnus spp., the proportion of females increased with length and spawning fish formed multiple large-scale aggregations within a broad latitudinal band. This study provides a starting point for biological parameters needed for stock assessment and conservation of K. audax and introduces the multiple aggregation spawning concept as a reproductive mechanism to explain genetic heterogeneity observed in some highly migratory species.

On the basis of previous studies of A. nobilis sound production relative to periods of known spawning activity, LARS were set to continuously record ambient sounds for a 2 h period around sunset from April to June 2009. Acoustic analyses identified A. nobilis courtship sounds on 89, 28 and 45% of the days at the three locations, respectively. From 474 h of acoustic data, spawning-related sounds (chants) were detected on 19 occasions in 2009 with an additional 11 spawning chants recorded during a 2007 validation period. Most spawning chants occurred within 30 min of sunset during the months of May and June at a mean +/- S.D. surface temperature of 18.2 +/- 1.2 degrees C. Consecutive daily spawning activity was not apparent at any sites in 2009. Atractoscion nobilis spawning chants were recorded at all three sites, suggesting that shallow rocky reefs which support kelp forests provide suitable A. nobilis spawning habitat. Results confirm the utility of passive acoustic recorders for identifying A. nobilis spawning periods and locations.

The anadromous status of the parental fish was confirmed using strontium isotopic analysis of otoliths. Whilst manganese concentrations in eggs varied over time, concentrations of aluminium, potassium, magnesium, strontium, barium and calcium were all unchanged 1 week and 6 weeks post-fertilization as well as in recently hatched larvae. The results clearly suggest that the distinctive trace element signature present in the eggs and newly hatched larvae of anadromous S. trutta (typically characterized by high strontium, low barium) is stable over time. Therefore analysis of the trace element composition of eggs is concluded to be a cost-effective and reliable method for determining the spatial and temporal extent of upstream spawning migration by anadromous salmonids. The temporal variability of at least one element in this study suggests the stability of untested multi-element signatures cannot automatically be assumed.

The results confirmed the existence of compensatory growth in R. caspicus which depended on the duration of food deprivation. Complete compensatory growth occurred in the fish that were food deprived for at least 3 weeks. Starvation and re-feeding had no significant effect on the digestive somatic index and intestinal surface areas in the fish that were food deprived for 1 week, while they showed a significant decrease and increase, during starvation and re-feeding in the fish that were food deprived for 2 and 3 weeks. This knowledge may have application in aquaculture, as appropriate exploitation of compensatory growth can give increased growth rate and feeding efficiency.

Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inferences did not correspond with any taxonomic scheme proposed to date. Rather, although L. richardsoni (from Alaska to California) and L. ayresii (from British Columbia to California) together constituted a well-supported clade distinct from several genetically divergent Lampetra populations in Oregon and California, these two species were not reciprocally monophyletic. The genetically divergent populations included L. pacifica (from the Columbia River basin) and L. hubbsi (from the Kern River basin) and four Lampetra sp. populations in Oregon (Siuslaw River and Fourmile Creek) and California (Kelsey and Mark West Creeks). These four Lampetra sp. populations showed genetic divergence between 2.3 and 5.7% from any known species (and up to 8.0% from each other), and may represent morphologically cryptic and thus previously undescribed species. A fifth population (from Paynes Creek, California) may represent a range extension of L. hubbsi into the Upper Sacramento River.

The species has been introduced into these systems, expanding its range, and is presumably well adapted to freshwater Iberian Peninsula ecosystems. The results show a consistent pattern for size of lateral fins, with L. gibbosus that inhabit streams in the Iberian Peninsula having longer lateral fins than those inhabiting reservoirs or lakes. Differences in fin placement, body depth and caudal peduncle dimensions do not differentiate populations of L. gibbosus from lentic and lotic water bodies and, therefore, are not consistent with functional expectations. Lepomis gibbosus from lotic and lentic habitats also do not show a consistent pattern of internal morphological differentiation, probably due to the lack of loticlentic differences in prey type. Overall, the univariate and multivariate analyses show that most of the external and internal morphological characters that vary among populations do not differentiate lotic from lentic Iberian populations. The lack of expected differences may be a consequence of the high seasonal flow variation in Mediterranean streams, and the resultant low- or no-flow conditions during periods of summer drought.

Using data for the top 10% of values and a randomization procedure, the maximum total length (L-T) and mass of each species and the maximum age of the first two species were estimated to be significantly greater off Perth than in the JBMP (all P < 0.001) and the maximum ages of O. lineolata in the two localities did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). These latitudinal trends, thus, typically conform to those frequently exhibited by fish species and the predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). While, in terms of mass, the instantaneous growth rates of each species were similar at both latitudes during early life, they were greater at the higher latitude throughout the remainder and thus much of life, which is broadly consistent with the MTE. When expressed in terms of L-T, however, instantaneous growth rates did not exhibit consistent latitudinal trends across all three species. The above trends with mass, together with those for reproductive variables, demonstrate that a greater amount of energy is directed into somatic growth and gonadal development by each of these species at the higher latitude. The consistency of the direction of the latitudinal trends for maximum body size and age and pattern of growth across all three species implies that each species is responding in a similar manner to differences between the environmental characteristics, such as temperature, at those two latitudes. The individual maximum L-T, mass and age and pattern of growth of O. lineolata at a higher and thus cooler latitude on the eastern Australian coast are consistent with the latitudinal trends exhibited by those characteristics for this species in the two western Australian localities. The implications of using mass rather than length as the indicator variable when comparing the maximum sizes of the three species and the trends exhibited by the instantaneous growth rates of those species at different latitudes are explored. Although growth curves fitted to both the L-T and masses at age for the males of each species lay above those for their females, this would not have influenced the conclusions drawn from common curves for both sexes.

The genetic variation of all remaining populations of the species was analysed using both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers and their habitat conditions were assessed using a water quality index (I-WQ). An 80% local extinction was found across the distribution of N. bilineata. The species was found in three of the 16 historical localities plus one previously unreported site. Most areas inhabited by the remaining populations had I-WQ scores unsuitable for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity. Populations showed low but significant genetic differentiation with both markers (mtDNA phi(ST) = 0.076, P < 0.001; microsatellite F-ST = 0.314, P < 0.001). Borbollon, in the Cuitzeo Basin, showed the highest level of differentiation and was identified as a single genetic unit by Bayesian assignment methods. Rio Grande de Morelia and Salamanca populations showed the highest genetic diversity and also a high migration rate facilitated by an artificial channel that connected the two basins. Overall, high genetic diversity values were observed compared with other freshwater fishes (average N-a = 16 alleles and loci and mean +/- S.D. H-o = 0.63 +/- 0.10 and nucleotide diversity pi = 0.006). This suggests that the observed genetic diversity has not diminished as rapidly as the species' habitat destruction. No evidence of correlation between habitat conditions and genetic diversity was found. The current pattern of genetic diversity may be the result of both historical factors and recent modifications of the hydrological system. The main threat to the species may be the rapid habitat deterioration and associated demographic stochasticity rather than genetic factors.

The vertebral cartilage develops in the following sequence: basidorsals and basiventrals, neural canals, neural spines and ribs. The development of ribs remained incomplete in the largest specimen (181 dph, 179 mm L-T) that was examined. Endoskeletal development of the fins began 4 dph for the dorsal and anal fins, 6 dph for the pectoral fin and 10 dph for the caudal and pelvic fins. Complete elements of all fins were observed by 91 dph and complete ossification of fin rays was observed by 122 dph in the double-stained specimens. Observation of the histological sections, however, suggested that ossification occurred soon after the formation of the organic matrix in the fin rays. Dorsal scutes were first visible by 25 dph, followed by the lateral and ventral scutes, which were visible by 37 and 44 dph, respectively. The number of scutes was fixed at 44, 59 and 91 dph and ossification was complete by 59 (dorsal) and 91 dph (lateral and ventral scutes) in the double-stained specimens. Ossification occurred soon after the formation of the scute organic matrix in the histological sections. Four types of scales were observed in the H. huso x A. ruthenus hybrid. Median predorsal, preanal and small scales on the anterior section of the head were visible by 59 dph. Scales on the caudal fin were visible by 91 dph and a variable assemblage of scales anterior to the anal fin was visible by 122 dph. Both the scutes and scales developed in a process that is similar to that of intramembranous ossification.

Fish biomass trophic guild compositions and biomass trophic spectrum profiles were analysed using multivariate statistical techniques and included both inter-regional (zoogeographic) and intra-regional (estuarine typology) comparisons. Differences in the fish trophic structure of the various estuary types within each zoogeographic region were observed; these were linked to the relative biomass contribution of the various trophic guilds and also to differences in biomass trophic spectrum profiles of the fishes in each estuary type within each region. In spite of these differences in trophic structure, all estuaries were dominated by detritivores, which suggests that the main food source (detritus) is similar in all biogeographic regions. Preliminary indications are that a similar dependence by estuary-associated fishes on detritus food sources exists on a global basis but that detailed studies are required in order to confirm this assertion.

A variety of personal lubricants and condoms were tested to determine the frequency of the false positive, as well as its potential source. Samples were extracted in both water and the manufacturer-provided buffer, and the test was performed according to the manufacturers suggested protocol. The false positive was observed intermittently, but occurred consistently with samples containing nonoxynol-9, a strong detergent utilized as a spermicide. The reaction may be attributable to the combination of latex and nonoxynol-9. Because of the unreliability of the test to confirm the presence of PSA in samples collected from condoms, the PSA cassette is an unsuitable method for confirming the presence of seminal fluid in condoms.

In particular, interactions between murid herpesvirus 4 and Mus musculus (a non-natural host species) have been extensively studied under controlled laboratory conditions. However, several fundamental aspects of murine gammaherpesvirus biology are not well understood, including how these viruses are transmitted from host to host, and their impacts on host fitness under natural conditions. Here, we investigate the epidemiology of a gammaherpesvirus in free-living wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in a 2-year longitudinal study. Wood mouse herpesvirus (WMHV) was the only herpesvirus detected and occurred frequently in wood mice and also less commonly in bank voles. Strikingly, WMHV infection probability was highest in reproductively active, heavy male mice. Infection risk also showed a repeatable seasonal pattern, peaking in spring and declining through the summer. We show that this seasonal decline can be at least partly attributed to reduced recapture of WMHV-infected adults. These results suggest that male reproductive behaviours could provide an important natural route of transmission for these viruses. They also suggest that gammaherpesvirus infection may have significant detrimental effects in wild hosts, questioning the view that these viruses have limited impacts in natural, co-evolved host species.

Here we investigate the consequences of multiple mating on fertility of Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni) females sequentially mated to irradiated ('sterile') and unirradiated ('normal') males. Females mated by two normal males showed persistent high fertility whereas females mated by two sterile males showed persistent low fertility. Despite lack of association between copula duration and sperm number, fertility of females mated to a normal and then a sterile male increased with duration of the first copulation and decreased with duration of the second. Fertility of females mated to a sterile male and then a normal male was not influenced by duration of the first copulation but increased with duration of the second. These findings reveal a need for increased attention to how factors other than sperm number influence post-copulatory sexual selection in tephritid flies, and in particular how copula duration is linked to sperm storage and usage.

Here we have studied the preferential body temperature (T-p) and its consequences on immune response performance after an immune challenge in larvae of Tenebrio molitor. We evaluated T-p and immune responses of larvae following a challenge with various concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and we studied the correlation between T-p and two immune traits, namely antibacterial and phenoloxidase (PO) activities. Larvae that were immune challenged with higher LPS concentrations (C-50 and C-100) preferred in average, warmer temperatures than did larvae challenged with lower concentrations (C-0 and C-25). T-p of C-25-C-100 (challenged)-mealworms was 2.3 degrees C higher than of C-0 (control) larvae. At lower LPS concentration immune challenge (C-0 and C-25) antibacterial activity correlated positively with T. but at C-50 and C-100 correlation was lose. PO activity was higher at higher LPS concentration, but its magnitude of response did not correlate with T-p Our data suggest that behavioural fever may have a positive effect on host performance by enhancing antibacterial response under a low pathogen load situation.

However, we and others have reported that cancer patients have a reduction in both NKT cell number and function. NKT cells can be stimulated and expanded with alpha-GalCer and cytokines and these expanded NKT cells retain their phenotype, remain responsive to antigenic stimulation, and display cytotoxic function against tumor cell lines. These data strongly favor the use of ex vivo expanded NKT cells in adoptive immunotherapy. NKT cell based-immunotherapy has been limited by the use of autologous antigen-presenting cells, which can vary substantially in their quantity and quality. A standardized system that relies on artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) could produce the stimulating effects of dendritic cell (DC) without the pitfalls of allo- or xenogeneic cells. In this review, we discuss the progress that has been made using CD1d-based aAPC and how this acellular antigen presenting system can be used in the future to enhance our understanding of NKT cell biology and to develop NKT cell-specific adoptive immunotherapeutic strategies.

It considers those factors in particular that impact on the overall health and survival of individuals as well as populations. Methods for the discrimination of the species are reviewed as well as the approaches being taken to delineate different populations, which is crucial to appropriately manage individual fisheries. Cockle populations generally undergo sexual maturation during their second summer and sexes are separate. Eggs are pelagic, with larvae being both benthic and pelagic before settling on the sediment and becoming benthic adults. However, data are lacking on basic larval biology and dispersal mechanisms. Data are provided on predator-prey relationships including information on types of food of importance to cockles. Main predators of cockles include brown shrimp, shore crabs, gastropods, polychaetes, fish and a variety of birds and these can be important in structuring cockle populations. Predation of larval cockles by adult cockles through larviphagy can lead to reductions of up to 40% of the population. Cockles are sensitive to a wide range of chemical contaminants but few data are published on impacts on cockles, in particular larval stages. The review concludes with an assessment of future climate change scenarios on cockles and considers some areas of future research required to preserve this ecologically and economically important species.

The effects of body size and declining oxygen tension on oxygen uptake in gastropods,"Abstract: Metabolic rate is one of the most frequently measured physiological variables and the relationship between oxygen uptake and body mass is one of the most controversial issues in biology. The present study used closed chamber respirometry to compare the oxygen uptake of 32 species of benthic British gastropod molluscs of a wide size-range (from less than 0.001 g to greater than to g dry tissue weight). We investigated the effects of body size on the respiratory rate at 10 degrees C to explore the evolutionary and phylogenetically determined patterns of metabolic scaling both among different gastropods groups, and within siphonate and asiphonate caenogastropods. Resting oxygen uptake ((V)over dotO(2)) increased with body mass (W) with a slope value of 0.6 using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and standard major axis (SMA) where N = 488, over a 6 fold range of body mass. The slopes b of the regression lines relating oxygen uptake to body mass were similar for all heterobranch molluscs and most caenogastropods. Highest mass-specific rates for oxygen consumption were found for the smallest littorinid species. Trophic mode significantly affected the amount of oxygen consumed with higher oxygen uptake in herbivores than other groups, including detritivores and predators. All of the gastropods reduced their oxygen consumption when exposed to declining oxygen conditions; however, about a third of the species exhibited partial regulation at higher oxygen partial pressures. When exposed to 20% normal saturation levels, smaller gastropods respired at approximately 25% of their rates in fully saturated seawater whereas larger species (above 0.1 g dry tissue weight) respired at approximately 35% of the values recorded at full saturation. Our study suggests that a scaling exponent relating O-2 to body mass of 0.6 is typical and may be 'universal' for gastropods. It is below the 0.75 scaling exponent which has been proposed for ectothermic invertebrates. It is concluded that size does matter in determining the metabolic patterns of gastropods and that the quantity of oxygen consumed and the energy balance of gastropods is affected by activity, food type and exposure to declining oxygen conditions.

Analysis of renal biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis revealed a significant reduction in total podocyte Plekhh2 expression compared to controls. Sequence analysis indicated a putative a-helical coiled-coil segment as the only recognizable domain within the N-terminal half of the polypeptide, while the C-terminal half contains two PH, a MyTH4, and a FERM domain. We identified a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate consensus-binding site in the PH1 domain required for Plekhh2 localization to peripheral regions of cell lamellipodia. The N-terminal half of Plekkh2 is not necessary for lamellipodial targeting but mediates self-association. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that Plekhh2 directly interacts through its FERM domain with the focal adhesion protein Hic-5 and actin. Plekhh2 and Hic-5 coprecipitated and colocalized at the soles of podocyte foot processes in situ and Hic-5 partially relocated from focal adhesions to lamellipodia in Plekhh2-expressing podocytes. In addition, Plekhh2 stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton by attenuating actin depolymerization. Our findings suggest a structural and functional role for Plekhh2 in the podocyte foot processes.

As gene expression profiles (GEPs) reflect the biology of MM in individual patients, we built a prognostic signature based on GEPs. GEPs obtained from newly diagnosed MM patients included in the HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 trial (n = 290) were used as training data. Using this set, a prognostic signature of 92 genes (EMC-92-gene signature) was generated by supervised principal component analysis combined with simulated annealing. Performance of the EMC-92-gene signature was confirmed in independent validation sets of newly diagnosed (total therapy (TT) 2, n = 351; TT3, n = 142; MRC-IX, n = 247) and relapsed patients (APEX, n = 264). In all the sets, patients defined as high-risk by the EMC-92-gene signature show a clearly reduced overall survival (OS) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.19-5.29) for the TT2 study, 5.23 (95% CI: 2.46-11.13) for the TT3 study, 2.38 (95% CI: 1.65-3.43) for the MRC-IX study and 3.01 (95% CI: 2.06-4.39) for the APEX study (P<0.0001 in all studies). In multivariate analyses this signature was proven to be independent of the currently used prognostic factors. The EMC-92-gene signature is better or comparable to previously published signatures. This signature contributes to risk assessment in clinical trials and could provide a tool for treatment choices in high-risk MM patients.

Recent advances in genetics and genomics have brought unprecedented insights into the domestication of many organisms and have opened new avenues for further improvements to be made. Yet, our ability to engineer biological systems is not without limits; genetic manipulation is often quite difficult. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not only one of the most powerful model organisms, but is also the premier producer of fermented foods and beverages around the globe. As a model system, it entertains a hefty workforce dedicated to deciphering its genome and the function it encodes at a rich mechanistic level. As a producer, it is used to make leavened bread, and dozens of different alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine. Yet, applying the awesome power of yeast genetics to understanding its origins and evolution requires some knowledge of its wild ancestors and the environments from which they were derived. A number of surprisingly diverse lineages of S.cerevisiae from both primeval and secondary forests in China have been discovered by Wang and his colleagues. These lineages substantially expand our knowledge of wild yeast diversity and will be a boon to elucidating the ecology, evolution and domestication of this academic and industrial workhorse.

These pioneering scientists showed that populations are chock-full of genetic variation. This variation was a surprise that required a re-thinking of evolutionary genetic heuristics. Understanding the causes for the maintenance of this variation became and remains a major area of research. In the process of addressing the causes, this same group of scientists documented geographical genetic structure (Prakash etal. 1969), spawning the continued accumulation of what is now a huge case study catalogue of geographical differentiation (e.g. Loveless & Hamrick 1984; Linhart & Grant 1996). Geographical differentiation is clearly quite common. Yet, a truly general understanding of the patterns in and causes of spatial genetic structure across the genome remains elusive. To what extent is spatial structure driven by drift and phylogeography vs. geographical differences in environmental sources of selection? What proportion of the genome participates? A general understanding requires range-wide data on spatial patterning of variation across the entire genome. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Lasky etal. (2012) make important strides towards addressing these issues, taking advantage of three contemporary revolutions in evolutionary biology. Two are technological: high-throughput sequencing and burgeoning computational power. One is cultural: open access to data from the community of scientists and especially data sets that result from large collaborative efforts.

However, little is known of the ecology and population structure of this species in nature. Here, we present a field survey of this yeast at an unprecedented scale and have performed population genetics analysis of Chinese wild isolates with different ecological and geographical origins. We also included a set of worldwide isolates that represent the maximum genetic variation of S.cerevisiae documented so far. We clearly show that S.cerevisiae is a ubiquitous species in nature, occurring in highly diversified substrates from human-associated environments as well as habitats remote from human activity. Chinese isolates of S.cerevisiae exhibited strong population structure with nearly double the combined genetic variation of isolates from the rest of the world. We identified eight new distinct wild lineages (CHN IVIII) from a set of 99 characterized Chinese isolates. Isolates from primeval forests occur in ancient and significantly diverged basal lineages, while those from human-associated environments generally cluster in less differentiated domestic or mosaic groups. Basal lineages from primeval forests are usually inbred, exhibit lineage-specific karyotypes and are partially reproductively isolated. Our results suggest that greatly diverged populations of wild S.cerevisiae exist independently of and predate domesticated isolates. We find that China harbours a reservoir of natural genetic variation of S.cerevisiae and perhaps gives an indication of the origin of the species.

Theory predicts that dispersal by fat-tailed kernels reshuffles genetic material, and thus, preserves genetic diversity during colonization. Moreover, if efficient long-distance dispersal is coupled with random colonization, an inverse isolation effect is predicted to develop in which increasing genetic diversity per colonizer is expected with increasing distance from a genetically variable source. By contrast, increasing isolation leads to decreasing genetic diversity when dispersal is via thin-tailed kernels. Here, we use a well-established model group for dispersal biology (peat mosses: genus Sphagnum) with a fat-tailed dispersal kernel, and the natural laboratory of the Stockholm archipelago to study the validity of the inverse isolation hypothesis in spore-dispersed plants in island colonization. Population genetic structure of three species (Sphagnum fallax, Sphagnum fimbriatum and Sphagnum palustre) with contrasting life histories and ploidy levels were investigated on a set of islands using microsatellites. Our data show (phi(st)', amova, IBD) that dispersal of the two most abundant species can be well approximated by a random colonization model. We find that genetic diversity per colonizer on islands increases with distance from the mainland for S.fallax and S.fimbriatum. By contrast, S.palustre deviates from this pattern, owing to its restricted distribution in the region, affecting its source pool strength. Therefore, the inverse isolation effect appears to hold in natural populations of peat mosses and, likely, in other organisms with small diaspores.

The molecular basis for these fluctuations is unknown. Here we used a genetic complementation strategy to investigate expression changes during transient periods of Nanog downregulation. Employing an integrated approach that includes high-throughput single-cell transcriptional profiling and mathematical modelling, we found that early molecular changes subsequent to Nanog loss are stochastic and reversible. However, analysis also revealed that Nanog loss severely compromises the self-sustaining feedback structure of the ES cell regulatory network. Consequently, these nascent changes soon become consolidated to committed fate decisions in the prolonged absence of Nanog. Consistent with this, we found that exogenous regulation of Nanog-dependent feedback control mechanisms produced a more homogeneous ES cell population. Taken together our results indicate that Nanog-dependent feedback loops have a role in controlling both ES cell fate decisions and population variability.

Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that B cells and antibodies contribute to MS pathogenesis in at least a subset of patients. The CNS provides a B-cell-fostering environment that includes B-cell trophic factors such as BAFF (B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family), APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), and the plasma-cell survival factor CXCL12. Owing to this environment, the CNS of patients with MS is not only the target of the immunopathological process, but also becomes the site of local antibody production. B cells can increase or dampen CNS inflammation, but their proinflammatory effects seem to be more prominent in most patients, as B-cell depletion is a promising therapeutic strategy. Other therapies not primarily designed to target B cells have numerous effects on the B-cell compartment. This Review summarizes key features of B-cell biology, the role of B cells and antibodies in CNS inflammation, and current attempts to identify the targets of pathogenic antibodies in MS.

Human UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like PHD and RING finger domain-containing 1) has multiple domains that bind chromatin, and it is implicated genetically in the maintenance of DNA methylation. However, molecular mechanisms underlying DNA methylation regulation by UHRF1 are poorly defined. Here we show that UHRF1 association with methylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9) is required for DNA methylation maintenance. We further show that UHRF1 association with H3K9 methylation is insensitive to adjacent H3 S10 phosphorylation-a known mitotic 'phospho-methyl switch'. Notably, we demonstrate that UHRF1 mitotic chromatin association is necessary for DNA methylation maintenance through regulation of the stability of DNA methyltransferase-1. Collectively, our results define a previously unknown link between H3K9 methylation and the faithful epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation, establishing a notable mitotic role for UHRF1 in this process.

This method has advantages over existing strategies to induce gene silencing. Previous studies in fission yeast have characterized TGS as a cis-specific process involving RNA interference that maintains heterochromatic regions such as centromeres. In contrast, in mammalian cells, gene silencing is known to occur through a post-transcriptional mechanism that uses exogenous short interfering RNAs or endogenous microRNAs to inactivate mRNA. We now show that the introduction of convergent transcription plasmids into either Schizosaccharomyces pombe or mammalian cells allows the production of double-stranded RNA from inserted gene fragments, resulting in TGS of endogenous genes. We predict that using convergent transcription to induce gene silencing will be a generally useful strategy and allow for a fuller molecular understanding of the biology of TGS.

IMP3 expression is associated with triple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBCs), which are aggressive tumors associated with poor outcome. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that signaling pathways, which are characteristic of TNBCs, impact the expression of IMP3 and that IMP3 contributes to the function of TNBCs. The data obtained reveal that IMP3 expression is repressed specifically by estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) and its ligand 3 beta A-diol but not by ER alpha. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and consequent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway induce IMP3 transcription and expression. Interestingly, we discovered that the EGFR promoter contains an imperfect estrogen response element and that ER beta represses EGFR transcription. These data support a mechanism in which ER beta inhibits IMP3 expression indirectly by repressing the EGFR. This mechanism relates to the biology of TNBC, which is characterized by diminished ER beta and increased EGFR expression. We also demonstrate that IMP3 contributes to the migration and invasion of breast carcinoma cells. Given that IMP3 is an mRNA-binding protein, we determined that it binds several key mRNAs that could contribute to migration and invasion, including CD164 (endolyn) and MMP9. Moreover, expression of these mRNAs is repressed by ER beta and enhanced by EGFR signaling, consistent with our proposed mechanism for the regulation of IMP3 expression in breast cancer cells. Our findings show that IMP3 is an effector of EGFR-mediated migration and invasion and they provide the first indication of how this important mRNA-binding protein is regulated in cancer.

This biology is believed to account for the exquisite sensitivity of multiple myeloma (MM) to the proteasomal inhibitor bortezcmib (BTZ). Despite remarkable response rates to BTZ in MM, BTZ carries the potential for serious side-effects and development: of resistance. We, therefore, sought to identify therapeutic combinations that effectively disrupt proteostasis in order to provide new potential treatments for MM. We found that sulforaphane, a dietary isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, inhibits TNF alpha-induced I kappa beta proteasomal degradation in a manner similar to BTZ. Like BTZ, sulforaphane synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide (ATO), an agent with clinical activity in MM. ATO and sulforaphane co-treatment augmented apoptotic induction as demonstrated by cleavage of caspase-3, -4 and PARP. The enhanced apoptotic response was dependent upon production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as demonstrated by glutathione depletion and partial inhibition of the apoptotic cascade after pretreatment with the radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Combination treatment resulted in enhanced ER stress signaling and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), indicative of perturbation of proteostasis. Specifically, combination treatment caused elevated expression of the molecular chaperone HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) along with increased PERK (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) and eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing, key indicators of UPR activation. Moreover, increased splicing of XBP1 was apparent upon combination treatment compared to treatment with either agent alone. Sulforaphane in combination with ATO effectively disrupts protein homeostasis through ROS generation and induction of ER stress to culminate in inhibition of protein secretion and apoptotic induction in MM. Our results suggest that sulforaphane deserves further investigation in combination with ATO in the treatment of MM.

Synchronization frequently arises through chemical communication via signaling molecules distributed through an external medium. We study a simple theoretical model for dynamical quorum sensing: a heterogenous population of limit-cycle oscillators diffusively coupled through a common medium. We show that this model exhibits a rich phase diagram with four qualitatively distinct physical mechanisms that can lead to a loss of coherent population-level oscillations, including a novel mechanism arising from effective time-delays introduced by the external medium. We derive a single pair of analytic equations that allow us to calculate phase boundaries as a function of population density and show that the model reproduces many of the qualitative features of recent experiments on Belousov-Zhabotinsky catalytic particles as well as synthetically engineered bacteria.

Here we review and discuss several key examples of among-population variation in insect thermal performance, including latitudinal gradients in chill coma recovery time, variation in energy consumption and metabolic biochemistry, rapid changes in thermal biology with range expansion in invasive and introduced species, and potential constraints on variation in thermal performance traits. This review highlights that while there is substantial evidence for among-population variation that is generally correlated with local climate regimes, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the implications for whole-animal fitness in the field are well understood. We also discuss the potential limitations of interpreting evolved variation among populations and argue for a genes-to-environment approach to population-level variation in thermal biology of insects.

Although much is known about fruit development and climacteric ripening, little information is available about how ethylene biosynthesis is regulated during the postclimacteric phase. A targeted systems biology approach revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of ethylene biosynthesis of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) when fruit have reached their maximal ethylene production level and which is characterized by a decline in ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene production is shut down at the level of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase. At the same time, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase activity increases. Analysis of the Yang cycle showed that the Yang cycle genes are regulated in a coordinated way and are highly expressed during postclimacteric ripening. Postclimacteric red tomatoes on the plant showed only a moderate regulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and Yang cycle genes compared with the regulation in detached fruit. Treatment of red fruit with 1-methylcyclopropane and ethephon revealed that the shut-down mechanism in ethylene biosynthesis is developmentally programmed and only moderately ethylene sensitive. We propose that the termination of autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis of system 2 in ripe fruit delays senescence and preserves the fruit until seed dispersal.

In woody species, growth phases and dormancy follow one another consecutively. In the oldest living individuals, the annual cycle may run for more than 1,000 years. So far, however, not much is known about the processes triggering reactivation from dormancy. In this study, we focused on wood rays, which are known to play an important role in tree development. The transition phase from dormancy to flowering in early spring was compared with the phase of active growth in summer. Rays from wood samples of poplar (Populus x canescens) were enriched by laser microdissection, and transcripts were monitored by poplar whole-genome microarrays. The resulting seasonally varying complex expression and metabolite patterns were subjected to pathway analyses. In February, the metabolic pathways related to flower induction were high, indicating that reactivation from dormancy was already taking place at this time of the year. In July, the pathways related to active growth, like lignin biosynthesis, nitrogen assimilation, and defense, were enriched. Based on ""marker"" genes identified in our pathway analyses, we were able to validate periodical changes in wood samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These studies, and the resulting ray database, provide new insights into the steps underlying the seasonality of poplar trees.

Chorismate mutases have been widely studied experimentally and computationally to elucidate the transition state of the enzyme catalyzed reaction and the origin of the high catalytic rate. However, studies about substrate entry and product exit to and from the highly occluded active site of the enzyme have to our knowledge not been performed on this enzyme. Crystallographic data suggest a possible substrate entry gate, that involves a slight opening of the enzyme for the substrate to access the active site. Using multiple molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the natural dynamic process of the product exiting from the binding pocket of MtCM. We identify a dominant exit pathway, which is in agreement with the gate proposed from the available crystallographic data. Helices H2 and H4 move apart from each other which enables the product to exit from the active site. Interestingly, in almost all exit trajectories, two residues arginine 72 and arginine 134, which participate in the burying of the active site, are accompanying the product on its exit journey from the catalytic site.

The assembly state of newly made herpesvirus particles during anterograde transport in axons is an essential question in alphaherpesvirus biology. The structure of the particle has remained both elusive and controversial for the past two decades, with conflicting evidence from EM, immunofluorescence, and live cell imaging studies. Two opposing models have been proposedthe Married and Separate Models. Under the Married Model, infectious virions are assembled in the neuronal cell body before sorting into axons and then traffic inside a transport vesicle. Conversely, the Separate Model postulates that vesicles containing viral membrane proteins are sorted into axons independent of capsids, with final assembly of mature virions occurring at a distant egress site. Recently, a complementary series of studies employing high-resolution EM and live cell fluorescence microscopy have provided evidence consistent with the Married Model, whereas other studies offer evidence supporting the Separate Model. In this review, we compare and discuss the published data and attempt to reconcile divergent findings and interpretations as they relate to these models. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, there is no standard protocol for differentiating hESCs into osteoblastic cells. The aim of this study was to identify the emergence of a human stromal (mesenchymal and skeletal) stem cell (hMSC)-like population, known to be osteoblastic cell precursors and to test their osteoblastic differentiation capacity in ex vivo cultures and in vivo. We cultured hESCs in a feeder-free environment using serum replacement and as suspension aggregates (embryoid bodies; hEBs). Over a 20 day developmental period, the hEBs demonstrated increasing enrichment for cells expressing hMSC markers: CD29, CD44, CD63, CD56, CD71, CD73, CD105, CD106, and CD166 as revealed by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis. Ex vivo differentiation of hEBs using bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) combined with standard osteoblast induction medium led to weak osteoblastic induction. Conversely, subcutaneous in vivo implantation of day 20 hEBs in immune deficient mice, mixed with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) as an osteoconductive scaffold, revealed bone and cartilage, and fibrous tissue elements after 8 weeks. These tissues were of human origin and there was no evidence of differentiation to nonmesodermal tissues. hEBs implanted in the absence of HA/TCP formed vacuolated tissue containing glandular, fibrous and muscle-like tissue elements. Conversely, implantation of undifferentiated hESCs resulted in the formation of a teratoma containing a mixture of endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal tissues. Our study demonstrates that hMSC-like cells can be obtained from hESCs and they can be induced to form skeletal tissues in vivo when combined with HA/TCP. These findings are relevant for tissue engineering and suggest that differentiated hEBs can provide an unlimited source for functional osteogenic cells.

Nowadays, a variety of natural or synthetic Cap-based biomaterials are produced and have been extensively used for dental and orthopaedic applications. This is justified by their biocompatibility, osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity (i.e. the intrinsic material property that initiates de novo bone formation), which are attributed to the chemical composition, surface topography, macro/microporosity and the dissolution kinetics. However, the exact molecular mechanism of action is unknown. This review paper first summarizes the most important aspects of bone biology in relation to CaP and the mechanisms of bone matrix mineralization. This is followed by the research findings on the effects of calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate (PO43-) ions on the migration, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts during in vivo bone formation and in vitro culture conditions. Further, the rationale of using CaP for bone regeneration is explained, focusing thereby specifically on the material's osteoinductive properties. Examples of different material forms and production techniques are given, with the emphasis on the state-of-the art in fine-tuning the physicochemical properties of CaP-based biomaterials for improved bone induction and the use of CaP as a delivery system for bone morphogenetic proteins. The use of computational models to simulate the CaP-driven osteogenesis is introduced as part of a bone tissue engineering strategy in order to facilitate the understanding of cell-material interactions and to gain further insight into the design and optimization of CaP-based bone reparative units.

The present study investigated the dispersal and distribution of WCR larvae in the maize root system during their development at two growth stages of maize (BBCH 1314 and BBCH 1718). 2 Dispersal of the WCR larvae increased as they developed; the larvae moved off their original place of emergence and into deeper soil layers. Overall, changes in the horizontal distribution of the larvae were more extensive than changes in the vertical distribution. 3 The spatial analysis of distance indices revealed that the larvae had an aggregative distribution throughout their development. The feeding site of larvae in the root system was determined by the stage of larval development. Initially, WCR larvae started feeding in close proximity to their emergence location and moved to more developed root tissue towards the end of their development. 4 Differences in root phenology mainly influenced the distribution of the larvae at the end of their development, when larvae exhibited increased vertical movement at a later growth stage of maize. 5 The mechanisms of these distributional changes and the implications for the management of WCR larvae are discussed, especially with regard to chemical control, because fewer larvae are expected to be targeted at a later growth stage of maize.

Transmission of shear forces to platelet receptors such as GPIb alpha, P-selectin, alpha(2)beta(1), and alpha(2b)beta(3) controls adhesion dynamics. These forces also drive membrane tether formation, cellular deformation, and mechanosignaling in blood cells. Blood flow results in red blood cell (RBC) drift towards the center of the vessel along with a near-wall plasma layer enriched with platelets. RBC motions also dramatically enhance platelet dispersion. Trajectories of individual platelets near a thrombotic deposit dictate capture-activation-arrest dynamics as these newly arriving platelets are exposed to chemical gradients of ADP, thromboxane, and thrombin within a micron-scale boundary layer formed around the deposit. If shear forces are sufficiently elevated (> 50 dyne/cm(2)), the largest polymers of von Willebrand Factor may elongate with concomitant shear-induced platelet activation. Finally, thrombin generation enhances platelet recruitment and clot strength via fibrin polymerization. By combination of coarse-graining, continuum, and stochastic algorithms, the numerical simulation of the growth rate, composition, and occlusive/embolic potential of a thrombus now spans multiscale phenomena.

Sepsis is a manifestation of disordered systemic inflammation. Properly regulated inflammation allows for timely recognition and effective reaction to injury or infection, but inadequate or overly robust inflammation can lead to Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). There is an incongruity between the systemic nature of disordered inflammation (as the target of inflammation-modulating therapies), and the regional manifestation of organ-specific failure (as the subject of organ support), that presents a therapeutic dilemma: systemic interventions can interfere with an individual organ system's appropriate response, yet organ-specific interventions may not help the overall system reorient itself. Based on a decade of systems and computational approaches to deciphering acute inflammation, along with translationally-motivated experimental studies in both small and large animals, we propose that MODS evolves due to the feed-forward cycle of inflammation -> damage -> inflammation. We hypothesize that inflammation proceeds at a given, ""nested"" level or scale until positive feedback exceeds a ""tipping point."" Below this tipping point, inflammation is contained and manageable; when this threshold is crossed, inflammation becomes disordered, and dysfunction propagates to a higher biological scale (e.g., progressing from cellular, to tissue/organ, to multiple organs, to the organism). Finally, we suggest that a combination of computational biology approaches involving data-driven and mechanistic mathematical modeling, in close association with studies in clinically relevant paradigms of sepsis/MODS, are necessary in order to define scale-specific ""tipping points"" and to suggest novel therapies for sepsis.

Current therapy incorporates chemotherapy to treat systemic disease and radiotherapy to assist with local control. We sought to evaluate the timing of surgery and role of adjuvant radiotherapy.We reviewed the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital chest wall ES experience from 1979 to 2009. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment variables, and outcomes were analyzed with respect to timing of surgery and use of adjuvant radiotherapy.Our cohort consisted of 36 patients with chest wall ES; median follow-up was 14.2 years, and 15-year estimate of overall survival was 66 %. In patients with localized disease, the timing of surgery (up-front vs. delayed) did not impact margin negativity or the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, but it did decrease the extent of chest wall resection. When considering radiotherapy in patients with localized disease, we found that patients who did not receive radiotherapy had smaller tumor size (median 6 vs. 10 cm) (p = 0.04) and were more likely to have had negative margins (p = 0.01) than patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient in each group developed a locoregional recurrence. The 15-year estimated of overall survival for patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy was 80 versus 100 % for those who did not.Delayed surgery decreased the extent of chest wall resection and helped define a patient population with favorable tumor biology. Patients with complete pathologic responses to chemotherapy, and those with tumors < 8 cm and negative surgical margins may be spared adjuvant radiotherapy without any decrement in overall survival.

Its activity can be measured using an artificial substrate, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). Miller firstly described the standard quantitative assay of beta-galactosidase activity in the cells of bacterial cultures by disrupting the cell membrane with the permeabilization solution instead of preparing cell extracts. Therefore, beta-galactosidase became one of the most widely used reporters of gene expression in molecular biology to reflect intracellular gene expression difference. But the Miller assay procedure could not monitor the beta-galactosidase reaction in real time and its results were greatly influenced by some operations in the Miller procedure, such as permeabilization time, reaction time and concentration of the cell suspension. A scanning method based on the Miller method to determine the intracellular beta-galactosidase activity in E. coli Tuner (DE3) expressing beta-galactosidase in real time was developed and the permeabilization time of cells was optimized for that. The comparison of 3 assays of beta-galactosidase activity (Miller, colorimetric and scanning) was made. The results proved that scanning method for the determination of enzyme activity with using ONPG as substrate is simple, fast and reproducible.

The crab has virtually disappeared from areas where it was abundant, such as the Balearic Islands and the Catalan coast. Maja squinado, is economically and ecologically very valuable, and it is essential to obtain information on its biology and rearing conditions to attempt to repopulate the damaged stocks of the species in the Mediterranean basin. Herein, we describe the first successful rearing of M. squinado under laboratory conditions. Our results show that M. squinado is an excellent candidate for restocking using cultured juveniles. Two consecutive broods with a 14 day interbrood period were observed in the laboratory in wild-caught females, the maximum observed duration of embryonic development of the egg mass being 32 days at 18.4 +/- 0.9 degrees C, and went through four different stages. The complete larval and first juvenile development was studied in laboratory cultures fed enriched Artemia metanauplius. At 19.6 +/- 0.6 degrees C, development from hatching to first crab moult took 17 days, and it comprised two zoeae stages and one megalopa stage.

However, the specific in vivo role of this ephrin receptor in OA remains unknown. We investigated in mice the in vivo effect of bone-specific EphB4 overexpression on OA pathophysiology.Methods Morphometric, morphologic, and radiologic evaluations were performed on postnatal day 5 (P5) mice and on 10-week-old mice. Knee OA was induced surgically by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) in 10-week-old male EphB4 homozygous transgenic (EphB4-Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice. Medial compartment evaluations of cartilage were performed using histology and immunohistochemistry, and evaluations of subchondral bone using histomorphometry, osteoclast staining, and microcomputed tomography.Results There was no obvious phenotype difference in skeletal development between EphB4-Tg mice and WT mice at P5 or at 10 weeks. At 8 and 12 weeks post-DMM, the EphB4-Tg mice demonstrated significantly less cartilage alteration in the medial tibial plateau and the femoral condyle than did the WT mice. This was associated with a significant reduction of aggrecan and type II collagen degradation products, type X collagen, and collagen fibril disorganization in the operated EphB4-Tg mice. The medial tibial subchondral bone demonstrated a significant reduction in sclerosis, bone volume, trabecular thickness, and number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatasepositive osteoclasts at both times assessed post-DMM in the EphB4-Tg mice than in the WT mice.Conclusion This is the first in vivo evidence that bone-specific EphB4 overexpression exerts a protective effect on OA joint structural changes. The findings of this study stress the in vivo importance of subchondral bone biology in cartilage integrity.

High-throughput sequencing of microsatellite-enriched libraries dramatically expedites the traditional process of screening recombinant libraries for microsatellite markers. However, sorting through millions of reads to distill high-quality polymorphic markers requires special algorithms tailored to tolerate sequencing errors in locus reconstruction, distinguish paralogous loci, rarify raw reads originating from the same amplicon and sort out various artificial fragments resulting from recombination or concatenation of auxiliary adapters.

The approach is computationally efficient and essentially free of user-set tuning parameters. Results on data where the true, underlying network is known place the approach favorably relative to existing approaches. We apply these methods to reverse-phase protein array time-course data from a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) to predict signaling links that we independently validate using targeted inhibition.

She distinguishes two broad classes of such uses (weak and strong) on the basis of assumptions held by biologists about the role and the importance of natural selection. This is an interesting proposal that could help in the epistemological characterisation of some biological practices. However, Potochnik's distinction also rests on the assumption that all optimality modelling represent the selection dynamic involved in the system of phenomena being considered. Since this assumption does not hold for models belonging to optimal foraging theory (OFT)-one of behavioural ecology's important modelling traditions-Potochnik's proposal has to be critically reappraised. In this paper, we briefly discuss what is optimality modelling and what it means for a model to represent a dynamic of selection or of evolution. Then, we demonstrate that OFT modelling is unable to represent either past or contemporary selection dynamics. In order to make this point, we carefully delineate the theory's rationale. This allows us to identify and analyse the assumptions on which the theory is built, and to circumscribe precisely the role that natural selection plays in it. Next, we show that the distinction of weak and strong uses of optimality modelling is seriously weakened when OFT modelling is taken into account. More precisely, the distinction is either irrelevant (if the assumption that selection dynamics are represented in all optimality modelling is held) or of a modest utility (if the assumption is dropped). However, we suggest that Potochnik's original proposal could be saved, and that it even constitutes a tool to appraise the marks left in the literature by the evolution of optimality modelling practices in the last four decades, provided that it is made into a tripartite distinction.

Conventional demarcations of individuals and generations, such as physiological autonomy, unicellular bottlenecks, and alternation of generation, are rife with problems. Do physically separated cuttings or plant ramets constitute separate individuals or generations? Are chimaeras one or more individuals? To resolve these problems, Clarke (Biol Philos 27(3): 321-361, 2012) proposed that individuals are circumscribed by mechanisms that constrain heritable variance in fitness. Simultaneously, Gorelick and Heng (Evolution 65(4): 1088-1098 2011) showed that sex constrains heritable variance Therefore, for eukaryotes, meiosis and karyogamy provide a consistent way to demarcate individuals and generations. Epigenetic reset associated with meiosis and karyogamy rejuvenates the next generation, but not the parent(s) that engaged in the sex act. Wholesale epigenetic resets that probably only occur with meiosis and karyogamy imply that monozygotic twins are two different individuals, but apomictic progeny are diffuse parts of one disaggregated individual. Mitotic heritability circumscribes an individual, whereas meiotic heritability demarcates new individuals and generations.

Although BCR-ABL1 activation is present in all patients with CML, patients can present in 3 different phases characterized by an increasingly worse prognosis and diminished responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blastic phase. The biologic basis for progression from chronic phase to blastic phase and for regulating the homeostasis of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant CML stem cells is not entirely understood. METHODS: To shed some light into these aspects of CML biology, the authors used reverse phase protein arrays probed with 112 individual monoclonal antibodies to compare protein expression patterns in 40 samples of leukemia-enriched fractions from patients with CML (25 in chronic phase, 5 in accelerated phase, and 10 in phase). RESULTS: An analysis of variance (significance cutoff, P < .01) unveiled a set of proteins that were overexpressed in blastic phase, including heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90); retinoblastoma (Rb); apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF); serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); B-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2); X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (Xiap); human homolog of Drosophila Mad (mothers against decapentaplegic) and related Caenorhabditis elegans gene Sma, family member 1 (Smad1); single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 alpha (SSBP2a); poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP); GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2); and tripartite motif containing 24 (Trim24). It is noteworthy that several of these proteins also were overexpressed in the CD34-positive compartment, which putatively contains the CML stem cell population.

METHODS: Patients with localized LMS (excluding any gynecologic subtype) or SMD who underwent surgery at the authors' institution from 1994 to 2010 were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) and the crude cumulative incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis (DM) were calculated, and multivariable analyses for DM and OS were carried out. RESULTS: In total, 327 patients were studied (71% LMS, 29% SMD). The median follow-up was 58 months (interquartile range, 31-97 months). The 5-year overall survival rate was 72.9% (95% confidence interval, 66.3%-80.2%) for the patients with LMS and 64.4% (95% confidence interval, 53.7%-77.1%) for the patients with SMD. The 5-year crude cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was 36.2% (95% confidence interval, 30.1%-43.5%) in the LMS group and 32.6% (95% confidence interval, 24%-44.2%) in the SMD group. Although tumor grade in LMS identified 3 distinct classes of risk, patients with grade 2 and grade 3 SMD had a similar course. The median postmetastasis survival was longer in patients with grade 3 LMS compared versus patients with grade 3 SMD (31 months vs 15 months, respectively). In patients who had grade 3 lesions, adjuvant chemotherapy yielded a better outcome in the SMD group compared with the LMS group (hazard ratio, 0.38). Patients who had superficial LMS had better outcomes compared with patients who had superficial SMD. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that LMS and SMD do not share the same natural history. A limited prognostic impact of grade was observed in patients with SMD. Differences in response to chemotherapy should be taken into account in planning the therapeutic approach for patients with these tumors.

However, abnormal levels of aminothiols are associated with a variety of diseases. The native chemical ligation (NCL) reaction has attracted great attention in the fields of chemistry and biology. NCL of peptide segments involves cascade reactions between a peptide-a-thioester and an N-terminal cysteine peptide.

On the basis of this new strategy, the ratiometric fluorescent probe 1 for aminothiols was judiciously designed. The new probe is highly selective toward aminothiols over other thiols and exhibits a very large variation (up to 160-fold) in its fluorescence ratio (I458/I603).

This species can be found from the San Maths Gulf, Argentina to Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil where it lives in symbiotic association with limpets of the family Calyptraeidae. Currently, two species of limpets have been reported as hosts of this species: Crepidula protea (d'Orbigny, 1841) and Crepidula argentina Simone, Pastorino & Penchaszadeh, 2000.

Thus, this pinnotherid appears to be, as others members of the family, a generalist symbiotic species since it dwells on almost all the potential limpet species reported for Argentina. However, there are notable differences in prevalence of C. garthi on each host, which suggest that the symbiont might prefer species of Crepidula over the others genera (Trochita and Bostrycapulus). Additionally, there exists an apparent relationship between host size and prevalence (e.g., Crepidula cachimilla, the limpet with the highest prevalence, is clearly larger than the others hosts). Perhaps it is premature to conclude that the size of the host might be of benefit for the symbiont, but it is a hypothesis worthy of being explored.

Human nature is seen as a set of drives and capacities, which play a key role in people's actions in any social context. In the textbooks, a variety of arguments suggest the irrelevance of a concept of human nature to the discipline. Partly, this message is conveyed by opposing social to biological explanations. In addition, the discipline is framed to exclude the concept of human nature. Society, on the one hand, and the culturally unique individual, on the other, exhaust the sociological arena. Accounts of socialization imply the transcendence of biology and with that, human nature. Refutations of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are supported with broad ranging rejections of biological explanation, with a similar implication that human nature is not a necessary concept in sociological accounts. Nevertheless, human nature is the elephant in the room. The concept is required and assumed in the detail of these textbooks as they explain current sociological research and analysis. One impact of the denial of human nature is to misunderstand current disputes between sociology and evolutionary psychology.

Although K+ has been demonstrated to be necessary for diverse cellular functions, such as enzyme activation, additional, still uncharacterized cellular targets may exist. We show here that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae short-term potassium deprivation impacts in the mRNA level of over one thousand genes. Lack of potassium drastically alters sulfur metabolism (mainly Met and Cys metabolism), triggers an oxidative stress response and activates the retrograde pathway, possibly due to the ammonium accumulation that occurs through the Trk1 potassium transporter. We also observe a remarkable halt in the expression of genes required for ribosome biogenesis and translation, a decrease in expression of diverse components (cyclins, protein kinases) required for progression through the cell cycle and a blockage in septins assembly. Only specific subsets of these changes were observed in a strain deleted for the TRK1 and TRK2 genes growing in the presence of sufficient potassium (50 mM). Therefore, a shortage of potassium in the environment triggers an acute transcriptional response, which covers different aspects of the cell biology so far unexplored, and whose investigation will likely reveal novel functional roles for this cation.

It arises through somatic evolution, by mutation and selection among pathogen cells within a host. Here, we examine the hypothesis that evolution of drug resistance could be reduced by developing drugs that target the secreted metabolites produced by pathogen cells instead of directly targeting the cells themselves. Using an agent-based computational model of an evolving population of pathogen cells, we test this hypothesis and find support for it. We also use our model to explain this effect within the framework of standard evolutionary theory. We find that in our model, the drugs most robust against evolved drug resistance are those that target the most widely shared external products, or public goods, of pathogen cells. We also show that these drugs exert a weak selective pressure for resistance because they create only a weak correlation between drug resistance and cell fitness. The same principles apply to design of vaccines that are robust against vaccine escape.

The hair follicle delves deep into the rich dermal macroenvironment as it grows to maturity where it is surrounded by large lipid-filled adipocytes. Intradermal adipocytes regenerate with faster kinetics than other adipose tissue depots and in parallel with the hair cycle, suggesting an interplay exists between hair follicle cells and adipocytes. While adipocytes have well-established roles in metabolism and energy storage, until recently, they were overlooked as niche cells that provide important growth signals to neighbouring skin cells. We discuss recent data supporting adipocytes as niche cells for the skin and skin pathologies that may be related to alterations in skin adipose tissue defects.

Although originally defined as an inducer of Th2-mediated responses, IL-33 was recently found to be involved in arthritis, a Th1/Th17-mediated disease. Here, we assessed the ability of IL-33 to promote inflammation via mast cells (MCs) and keratinocytes (KCs) activation in psoriasis. IL-33 resulted elevated in the skin but not in the serum of psoriasis patients. IL-33 was secreted by psoriasis KCs and HaCaT cells after TNF-alpha stimulation. In HMC-1, TNF-alpha, but not IL-17, could induce a robust increase in IL-33 expression. In HaCaT cells, TNF-alpha was able to induce IL-6, MCP-1 and VEGF, and the addition of IL-33 reinforced these increases. TNF-alpha + IL-33 combination showed similar results in primary KCs and ex vivo skin organ culture. In conclusion, our study suggests that IL-33 may be involved in psoriasis biology via MCs and KCs.

This is increasingly translating into success in the clinic, with five new kinase inhibitor drugs approved since 2011. However, despite encouraging signs in other areas, success has been largely restricted to oncology.Areas covered: This article reviews the prospects for kinase inhibitor drug discovery in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Major topics include the application of kinome profiling and lessons learned from kinase system-based research. With these fields nearing maturity, the validation of kinases as targets or their classification as liabilities is becoming increasingly pertinent. Other topics include a discussion of the properties required of good small molecule kinase probes.Expert opinion: The tractability of protein kinases to small molecule discovery through system-based research is excellent, and adequate selectivity can often be achieved. With advances in screening methodology now enabling compound profiling across most of the kinome, researchers involved in drug discovery must decide what inhibition profiles are desirable. However, this assessment must be made on the basis of incomplete understanding of the disease biology of most kinases, and as a result there is a significant risk that drugs entering clinical trials will lack efficacy. Because of this, as well as greater effort to determine which kinases are therapeutically relevant for particular diseases, opportunities for quality pre-candidate compounds developed for specific indications to find alternative uses should be maximised by early screening through panels of phenotypic assays.

To improve treatment, it is necessary to understand whether a specific population could be selected on a molecular feature of the tumor. Until there is better knowledge of the biology, further development of drugs such as lapatinib cannot be supported.

In the active state, Ras proteins interact with and modulate the activity of several downstream effectors regulating key cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence, migration and metabolism. Activating mutations of RAS genes and of genes encoding Ras signaling members have a great incidence in proliferative disorders, such as cancer, immune and inflammatory diseases and developmental syndromes. Therefore, Ras and Ras signaling represent important clinical targets for the design and development of pharmaceutically active agents, including anticancer agents.Areas covered: The authors summarize methods available to down-regulate the Ras pathway and review recent patents covering Ras signaling modulators, as well as methods designed to kill specifically cancer cells bearing activated RAS oncogene.Expert opinion: Targeted therapy approach based on direct targeting of molecules specifically altered in Ras-dependent diseases is pursued with molecules that down-regulate expression or inhibit the biological function of mutant Ras or Ras signaling members. The low success rate in a clinical setting of molecules targeting activated members of the Ras pathway may require development of novel approaches, including combined and synthetic lethal therapies.

They serve to regulate protein expression at translational level and represent a relatively less known exception to the traditional central 'dogma' of biology that information flows as DNA -> RNA -> protein and that it is stored in a co-linear way between the 5'-> 3' of nucleic acids and N -> C-terminal of polypeptides. In archaea, in which translational recoding regulates the decoding of the 21st and the 22nd amino acids selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, respectively, only one case of programmed -1 frameshifting has been reported so far and further examples, although promising, have not been confirmed yet. We here summarize the current state-of-the-art of this field that, especially in archaea, has relevant implications for the physiology of life in extreme environments and for the origin of life.

A geomicrobiological model of the different microbial cycles operating in the sediments was recently developed through molecular biological methods, suggesting the presence of iron reducers, methanogens, nitrate reducers and hydrogen producers. In this study, we used a combination of molecular biological methods and targeted enrichment incubations to validate this model and prove the existence of those potential anaerobic activities in the acidic sediments of Tinto River. Methanogenic, sulfate-reducing, denitrifying and hydrogen-producing enrichments were all positive at pH between 5 and 7. Methanogenic enrichments revealed the presence of methanogenic archaea belonging to the genera Methanosarcina and Methanobrevibacter. Enrichments for sulfate-reducing microorganisms were dominated by Desulfotomaculum spp. Denitrifying enrichments showed a broad diversity of bacteria belonging to the genera Paenibacillus, Bacillus, Sedimentibacter, Lysinibacillus, Delftia, Alcaligenes, Clostridium and Desulfitobacterium. Hydrogen-producing enrichments were dominated by Clostridium spp. These enrichments confirm the presence of anaerobic activities in the acidic sediments of the Tinto River that are normally assumed to take place exclusively at neutral pH.

An in vivo-like assay medium for enzyme activity determination was designed based on the concentrations of the major ionic constituents of the Escherichia coli cytosol: K+, Na+, Mg2+, phosphate, glutamate, sulfate and Cl-. The maximum capacities (V-max) of the extracted enzymes of two pathways were determined using both this in vivo-like assay medium and the assay medium specific for each enzyme. The enzyme activities differed between the two assay conditions. Most of the differences could be attributed to unsuspected, pleiotropic effects of K+ and phosphate. K+ activated some enzymes (aldolase, enolase and glutamate dehydrogenase) and inhibited others (phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase), whereas phosphate inhibited all glycolytic enzymes and glutamine synthetase but only activated glutamine 2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase. Neither a high glutamate concentration, nor macromolecular crowding affected the glycolytic or nitrogen assimilation enzymes, other than through the product inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase by glutamate. This strategy of assessing all pathway enzymes kinetically under the same conditions may be necessary to avoid inadvertent differences between in vivo and in vitro biochemistry. It may also serve to reveal otherwise unnoticed pleiotropic regulation, such as that demonstrated in the present study by K+ and phosphate.

The cellular storage of squalene and its impact on membrane properties have been the subject of recent investigations. In a screen for abnormal lipid droplet morphology and distribution in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found significant lipid droplet clustering (arbitrarily defined as an aggregation of six or more lipid droplets) in a number of mutants (e.g. erg1) that are defective in sterol biosynthesis. Interestingly, these mutants are also characterized by accumulation of large amounts of squalene. Reducing the level of squalene in these mutants restored normal lipid droplet distribution. Moreover, inhibition of squalene monooxygenase in two mammalian cell lines (CHO-K1 and 3T3-L1) by terbinafine also resulted in lipid droplet clustering. These results indicate that the level of squalene may affect the growth and distribution of lipid droplets.

Because iron is an important regulator of ROS biology, this study examined the effects of iron chelation on the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling. The administration of an iron chelator, deferoxamine, to rats prevented chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Various iron chelators inhibited the growth of cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Protein carbonylation, an important iron-dependent biological event, was promoted in association with pulmonary vascular remodeling and cell growth. A proteomic approach identified that Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (a negative regulator of RhoA) is carbonylated. In human plasma, the protein carbonyl content was significantly higher in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension than in healthy controls. These results suggest that iron plays an important role in the ROS-dependent mechanism underlying the development of pulmonary hypertension. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our knowledge of HSC biology is limited by the paucity of in vivo data. HSCs and sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) reside in close proximity, and interactions between these two cell types are potentially critical for their development and function. Here, we introduce a transgenic zebrafish line, Tg(hand2:EGFP), that labels HSCs. We find that zebrafish HSCs share many similarities with their mammalian counterparts, including morphology, location, lipid storage, gene-expression profile, and increased proliferation and matrix production, in response to an acute hepatic insult. Using the Tg(hand2:EGFP) line, we conducted time-course analyses during development to reveal that HSCs invade the liver after SECs do. However, HSCs still enter the liver in mutants that lack most endothelial cells, including SECs, indicating that SECs are not required for HSC differentiation or their entry into the liver. In the absence of SECs, HSCs become abnormally associated with hepatic biliary cells, suggesting that SECs influence HSC localization during liver development. We analyzed factors that regulate HSC development and show that inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling significantly reduces the number of HSCs that enter the liver. We also performed a pilot chemical screen and identified two compounds that affect HSC numbers during development. Conclusion: Our work provides the first comprehensive description of HSC development in zebrafish and reveals the requirement of SECs in HSC localization. The Tg(hand2:EGFP) line represents a unique tool for in vivo analysis and molecular dissection of HSC behavior.

IRTA1 expression was restricted to extranodal (93%) and nodal MZLs (73%) and to lymphomas with MZ differentiation. Extranodal MZL cells with the strongest IRTA1 expression were usually located adjacent to epithelia, mimicking the IRTA1 expression pattern of normal and acquired mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The cytological features, growth pattern and IRTA1 positivity in nodal MZLs suggest they may derive from IRTA1(+) perifollicular B cells or monocytoid B cells detectable in reactive lymph nodes. Double immunostaining for IRTA1/bcl-6 tracked the colonization of B-cell follicles by MZL cells, and showed modulation of their phenotype (e.g. acquisition of bcl-6) during recirculation through germinal centres. MZL cells differentiating into plasma cells usually lost IRTA1.Conclusions: These results further expand our knowledge of the biology of MZLs, and highlight IRTA1 as the first positive marker for MZLs, enabling more accurate diagnosis of these neoplasms.

However, DCN expression and action in the primate ovary has yet to be determined.Archival human and monkey ovarian samples were analyzed. Studies were conducted using FF and GC samples collected from IVF patients.Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, RTPCR, quantitative RTPCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies were complemented by cellular studies, including the measurements of intracellular Ca-2, reactive oxygen species (ROS), epidermal GF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation by DCN and caspase activity.Immunohistochemistry revealed strong DCN staining in the connective tissue and follicular thecal compartments, but not in GCs of pre-antral and antral follicles. Pre-ovulatory follicles could not be studied, but DCN was associated with connective tissue of CL samples and the cytoplasm of luteal cells. DCN expression in monkey CL doubled (P 0.05) towards the end of the luteal lifespan. DCN was found in human FF obtained from IVF patients (mean: 12.9 ng/ml; n 20) as determined by ELISA. DCN mRNA and/or protein were detected in freshly isolated and cultured, luteinized human GCs. In the latter, exogenous human recombinant DCN increased intracellular Ca-2 levels and induced the production of ROS in a concentration-dependent manner. DCN, like epidermal GF, phosphorylated EGFR significantly (P 0.05) and reduced the activity of caspase 3/7 in cultured GCs. The data indicate the expression of DCN in the theca of growing follicles, in FF of ovulatory follicles and in the CL. Therefore, DCN may exert paracrine actions via GF/GFR systems in multiple ovarian compartments.Functional studies were performed in cultures of human luteinized GCs, which are an apt model but may not fully mirror the pre-ovulatory GC compartment or the CL. Other human ovarian cells, including the thecal cells, were not available.In accordance with its evolving roles in other organs, ovarian DCN is an ECM-associated component, which acts as a multifunctional regulator of GF signaling in the primate ovary. DCN may thus be involved in folliculogenesis, ovulation and the regulation of the CL survival in primates.This study was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) MA1080/17-3 and in part DFG MA1080/21-1 (to AM), NIH grants HD24870 (S.R.O. and R.L.S.), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD/NIH through cooperative agreement HD18185 as part of the Specialized Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction and Infertility Research (S.R.O.) and 8P51OD011092-53 for the operation of the Oregon National Primate Research Center (G.A.D., J.D.H., S.R.O. and R.L.S).

The scale of the problems that are discussed ranges from small molecules to complex systems, where many organisms coexist. However, among all these issues, we can highlight genomics, which studies the genomes of microorganisms, plants, and animals. Predicting common patterns, i.e., motifs, in a set of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences is one of the important sequence analysis problems, and it has not yet been resolved in an efficient manner. In this study, we study the application of evolutionary multiobjective optimization to solve the motif discovery problem, applied to the specific task of discovering novel transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences. For this, we have designed, adapted, configured, and evaluated several types of multiobjective metaheuristics. After a detailed study, the results indicate that these metaheuristics are appropriate for discovering motifs. To find good approximations to the Pareto front, we use the hypervolume indicator, which has been successfully integrated into evolutionary algorithms. Besides the hypervolume indicator, we also use the coverage relation to ensure: Which is the best Pareto front?

In this imaging technique, the optical properties of tissues are reconstructed from the measurements obtained from the sensors located on the boundary. A computational method for the rapid noninvasive detection/quantification of cerebral hemorrhage is described using the above procedure. CFD Research Corporation's finite volume computational biology code was used to numerically mimic the NIRS procedure by (i) noninvasively numerically penetrating the brain tissues and (ii) reconstructing the optical properties the presence of water, oxygenated, and deoxygenated blood. These numerical noninvasive measurements are then used to predict the extent and severity of the brain hemorrhage. The paper also discusses ideas to obtain the location and the severity of a localized injury. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations are performed as a proof of concept for the numerical formulation being feasible for the above mentioned detection/quantification. The results demonstrate that this numerical NIRS formulation can be used as a noninvasive technique for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics.

However, the mechanisms of SMSC chondrogenesis remain to be identified and characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway, as well as the manner by which it may contribute to chondrogenesis and the actin cytoskeletal organization of tat temporomandibular SMSCs in response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Primary isolated SMSCs were treated with TGF-beta 1, and their actin organization was examined by fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin staining. The specific biochemical inhibitors, C3 transferase, Y27632 and SB431542, were employed to evaluate the function of RhoA/ROCK and Smads. The effect of C3 transferase and Y27632 on the gene expression of chondrocyte-specific markers was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. To examine the effect of Y27632 on Smad2/3 phosphorylation induced by TGF-beta 1, western blot analysis was also performed. The stimulation of TGF-beta 1 in SMSCs resulted in the activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway and concomitantly induced cytoskeletal reorganization, which was specifically blocked by C3 transferase and Y27632. The TGF-beta-induced gene expression of Sox9, type I collagen, type II collagen and aggrecan was also inhibited by both C3 transferase and Y27632, at different levels. Y27632 treatment reduced the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the RhoA/ROCK activation regulates chondrocyte-specific gene transcription and cytoskeletal organization induced by TGF-beta 1 by interacting with the Smad pathway. This may have significant implications for the successful utilization of SMSCs as a cell source for articular cartilage tissue engineering.

The status of lymph nodes and primary lesion was analyzed in terms of disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival.The 5-year disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival for the 46 patients overall were 41.3 and 32.2, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that pN status, the total number of involved lymph nodes, lymph node density and extranodal invasion were statistically significant variables predictive of disease-specific survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that the total number of involved lymph nodes, extranodal invasion and diameter of the metastatic lesion were statistically significant variables predictive of disease-specific survival. Interestingly, the diameter of metastatic lesions was inversely correlated with poorer survival. Patients with large (epsilon 10 mm) metastatic lesions and no extranodal invasion (expansive growth) had significantly better disease-specific survival than those with multiple small (10 mm) metastatic lesions and no extranodal invasion (highly spreading) (P 0.0156) or those with extranodal invasion (infiltrative growth) (P 0.0181).Our data indicate that the clinical outcome of node-positive patients is not only stratified according to the tumor burden reflected in the total number of involved lymph nodes, but also affected by tumor biology including invasiveness and potential for metastasis, which is reflected in pathological characteristics such as extranodal invasion and the diameter of metastatic lesions.

Comparative analyses are used to address the key question of what makes a species more prone to extinction by exploring the links between vulnerability and intrinsic species traits and/or extrinsic factors. This approach requires comprehensive species data but information is rarely available for all species of interest. As a result comparative analyses often rely on subsets of relatively few species that are assumed to be representative samples of the overall studied group.2. Our study challenges this assumption and quantifies the taxonomic, spatial, and data type biases associated with the quantity of data available for 5415 mammalian species using the freely available life-history database PanTHERIA.3. Moreover, we explore how existing biases influence results of comparative analyses of extinction risk by using subsets of data that attempt to correct for detected biases. In particular, we focus on links between four species traits commonly linked to vulnerability (distribution range area, adult body mass, population density and gestation length) and conduct univariate and multivariate analyses to understand how biases affect model predictions.4. Our results show important biases in data availability with c.22% of mammals completely lacking data. Missing data, which appear to be not missing at random, occur frequently in all traits (1499% of cases missing). Data availability is explained by intrinsic traits, with larger mammals occupying bigger range areas being the best studied. Importantly, we find that existing biases affect the results of comparative analyses by overestimating the risk of extinction and changing which traits are identified as important predictors.5. Our results raise concerns over our ability to draw general conclusions regarding what makes a species more prone to extinction. Missing data represent a prevalent problem in comparative analyses, and unfortunately, because data are not missing at random, conventional approaches to fill data gaps, are not valid or present important challenges. These results show the importance of making appropriate inferences from comparative analyses by focusing on the subset of species for which data are available. Ultimately, addressing the data bias problem requires greater investment in data collection and dissemination, as well as the development of methodological approaches to effectively correct existing biases.

The animals were obtained by systematic sampling in three intertidal zones (high, mid and low), from October 2008 to September 2009. The population density was low during most of spring and summer, increased during autumn and reached its maximum values at the end of this season (35 000 individuals/m(2)): a second, but lower, density peak occurred at the end of winter (15 000 individuals/m(2)). Male density remained below 1000 individuals/m(2) during most of the year in the three zones, although in September it was higher than 1800 individuals/m(2) in the high and mid intertidal zones. Female and juvenile density was below 5000 individuals/m(2) in spring and summer, with little variation between areas, but it differed among areas during autumn and winter, when both groups reached their maximum densities (20 000-40 000 individuals/m(2)) in the low and mid intertidal zones.

Abadie et al. associate an index of mean community specialization with functional biotic homogenization (BH), and they in turn associate functional BH with ecosystem functioning. However, the community specialization index is associated with a very specific kind of function the species response which has no clear link with ecosystem functioning. This problem is frequent in the literature on biotic homogenization. There is no clear sign in the data shown by Abadie et al. that metrics incorporating species attributes are much more reliable than taxonomic diversity indices. As frequently observed in the literature on biotic homogenization within communities, their results show no sign of loser or winner species or of extirpation of specialist species. Therefore, there seems to be no evidence in support of the biotic homogenization model they propose. Synthesis. The Average Community Specialization a mean specialization index is in itself incapable of identifying loser and winner species and has no clear link with ecosystem functioning. Methods other than mean trait approaches should be used to study either functional homogenization or the extirpation of specialist species.

Here, we assessed whether the presence of root aerenchyma can account for both the fundamental and realized ecohydrological niche in the Restionaceae. We documented the ability to make aerenchyma of almost 300 of the c. 350 South African Restionaceae species with the help of field observations, cultivation experiments and herbarium collections, and correlated this information with the ecohydrological niche of the species. We used a diversity of sampling approaches to account for variation in both aerenchyma and habitat at individual, population and species level. Tolerance of waterlogging in species with and without aerenchyma was investigated experimentally. To account for phylogenetic relatedness, the evolution of both aerenchyma and the ecohydrological niche was explored in the context of an almost complete species-level phylogeny using both parsimony and maximum likelihood optimization methods. We showed that the presence of aerenchyma was correlated with the ecohydrological niche at population and at species level, and after phylogenetic correction. Most individuals of non-aerenchymatous species died when waterlogged, whereas most species with aerenchyma were waterlogging tolerant. This indicates that waterlogging acts as an environmental filter that excludes non-aerenchymatous species from these conditions. The absence, and to a certain degree also the presence, of aerenchyma predicts both the field-observed realized and experimentally determined fundamental ecohydrological niche. Aerenchyma was ancestrally present as inferred by both parsimony and maximum likelihood reconstruction and showed a strong phylogenetic signal with frequent losses but few gains. The ecohydrological niche was evolutionary more labile, with niche changes in many evolutionary lineages. Changes from wetland to dry habitats were reconstructed in species with aerenchyma, whereas the reverse change was never inferred for species that had lost aerenchyma. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence that functional traits can effectively predict species niches, and evolution of these may constrain the habitats available to the clades. We underpin the importance of understanding the causal driver of the local distribution of species for making robust predictions of species range shifts under climate change.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious.

In addition to temperature and ocean acidification, increasing levels of hyposaline stress due to extreme precipitation events and freshwater runoff may be driving some of the reported recent range shifts in marine organisms. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, we characterized the proteomic responses of the cold-adapted blue mussel Mytilus trossulus, a native to the Pacific coast of North America, and the warm-adapted M. galloprovincialis, a Mediterranean invader that has replaced the native from the southern part of its range, but may be limited from expanding north due to hyposaline stress. After exposing laboratory-acclimated mussels for 4 h to two different experimental treatments of hyposaline conditions and one control treatment (24.5, 29.8 and 35.0 psu, respectively) followed by a 0 and 24 h recovery at ambient salinity (35 psu), we detected changes in the abundance of molecular chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), indicating protein unfolding, during stress exposure. Other common responses included changes in small GTPases of the Ras superfamily during recovery, which suggests a role for vesicle transport, and cytoskeletal adjustments associated with cell volume, as indicated by cytoskeletal elements such as actin, tubulin, intermediate filaments and several actin-binding regulatory proteins. Changes of proteins involved in energy metabolism and scavenging of reactive oxygen species suggest a reduction in overall energy metabolism during recovery. Principal component analyses of protein abundances suggest that M. trossulus is able to respond to a greater hyposaline challenge (24.5 psu) than M. galloprovincialis (29.8 psu), as shown by changing abundances of proteins involved in protein chaperoning, vesicle transport, cytoskeletal adjustments by actin-regulatory proteins, energy metabolism and oxidative stress. While proteins involved in energy metabolism were lower in M. trossulus during recovery from hyposaline stress, M. galloprovincialis showed higher abundances of those proteins at 29.8 psu, suggesting an energetic constraint in the invader but not the native congener. Both species showed lower levels of oxidative stress proteins during recovery. In addition, oxidative stress proteins associated with protein synthesis and folding in the ER showed lower levels during recovery in M. galloprovincialis, in parallel with ER chaperones, indicating a reduction in protein synthesis. These differences may enable the native M. trossulus to cope with greater hyposaline stress in the northern part of its range, as well as to outcompete M. galloprovincialis in the southern part of M. trossulus range, thereby preventing M. galloprovincialis from expanding further north.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with a strong risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, typically preceded by dysplastic alterations of cell morphology. We investigated the molecular mechanisms and the functional consequences of HCV-driven perturbations of epithelial polarity.Methods:We used biochemical, genetic, and cell biology approaches to assess the impact of hepatitis C viral protein NS5A on the polarity and function of hepatocytes and hepatic progenitors. Transgenic animals and xenograft models served for in vivo validation of the results obtained in cell culture.Results: We found that expression of HCV-NS5A in primary hepatic precursors and in immortalized hepatocyte cell lines gave rise to profound modifications of cell polarity, leading to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). NS5A, either alone or in the context of the full complement of viral proteins in the course of infection, acted through activating Twist2, a transcriptional regulator of EMT. The effects of NS5A were additive to those of TGF-beta, a cytokine abundant in diseased liver and highly relevant to HCV-related pathology. Moreover, NS5A cooperates with oncogenic Ras, giving rise to transformed, invasive cells that are highly tumorigenic in vivo.Conclusions: Our data suggest that in the context of HCV infection, NS5A favors formation of preneoplastic lesions by disrupting cell polarity and additional oncogenic events cooperate with the viral protein to give rise to motile and invasive tumour cells.

In this study, we show that exogenous IL-15 decreased IL-17A production in Th17 cultures. Neutralization of IL-15 using an Ab led to increases in IL17A production in Th17 cultures. Both Il15(-/-) and Il15r(-/-) T cell cultures displayed higher frequency of IL-17A producers and higher amounts of IL-17A in the supernatants compared with those of wild-type (WT) cells in vitro. IL-15 down-modulated IL-17A production independently of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gamma t, Foxp3, and IFN-gamma expression. Both Th17 cells and APCs produced IL-15, which induced binding of STAT5, an apparent repressor to the Il17 locus in CD4 T cells. Also, in a model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Il15(-/-) mice displayed exacerbated inflammation-correlating with increased IL-17A production by their CD4(+) T cells-compared with WT controls. Exogenous IL-15 administration and IL-17A neutralization reduced the severity of EAE in Il15(-/-) mice. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-15 has a negative regulatory role in fine-tuning of IL-17A production and Th17-mediated inflammation. The Journal of Immunology, 2012, 189: 4237-4246.

In this study, we determined the ionic current activities of the SecA-dependent channel from membrane vesicles depleted of SecYEG. We found that these SecYEG-depleted membranes produced SecA-dependent ionic currents in the oocytes, as did membranes containing SecYEG. However, reconstituted membranes depleted of SecYEG required higher concentrations of SecA to elicit ionic currents like those in membranes containing SecYEG. In contrast to membranes containing SecYEG, the proofreading capacity of signal peptides was lost for those membranes lacking SecYEG. These findings are consistent with loss of signal peptide specificity in channel activity from membranes of SecY suppressor or SecY plug domain mutants. The signal peptide specificity of the reconstituted membranes, like SecA-liposomes, can be restored by the addition of SecYEG proteoliposomes. On the other hand, the channel activity efficiency of reconstituted membranes was fully restored, while SecA-liposomes could only be partially enhanced by the addition of SecYEG, indicating that, in addition to SecYEG, other membrane proteins contribute to the efficiency of channel activity. The SecA-dependent channels in membranes that lacked SecYEG also lost ion selectivity to monovalent cations but retained selective permeability to large anions. Thus, the electrophysiological evidence presented here indicates that SecYEG is not obligatory for the channel activity of Escherichia coli membranes, as previously shown for protein translocation, and that SecYEG is important for maintenance of the efficiency and specificity of SecA-dependent channels.

To help address this, the authors developed the Life Sciences Domain Analysis Model (LS DAM), an information model that provides a framework for communication among domain experts and technical teams developing information systems to support biomedical research. The LS DAM is harmonized with the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model of protocol-driven clinical research. Together, these models can facilitate data exchange for translational research.Materials and methods The content of the LS DAM was driven by analysis of life sciences and translational research scenarios and the concepts in the model are derived from existing information models, reference models and data exchange formats. The model is represented in the Unified Modeling Language and uses ISO 21090 data types.Results The LS DAM v2.2.1 is comprised of 130 classes and covers several core areas including Experiment, Molecular Biology, Molecular Databases and Specimen. Nearly half of these classes originate from the BRIDG model, emphasizing the semantic harmonization between these models. Validation of the LS DAM against independently derived information models, research scenarios and reference databases supports its general applicability to represent life sciences research.Discussion The LS DAM provides unambiguous definitions for concepts required to describe life sciences research. The processes established to achieve consensus among domain experts will be applied in future iterations and may be broadly applicable to other standardization efforts.Conclusions The LS DAM provides common semantics for life sciences research.

To assess the difference between the two approaches, 1,040 articles with a variant of the phrase ""evolutionarily stable strategies"" (ESS) were identified by searching the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA) and discipline-level databases. The majority (72%) of all articles were published in life sciences journals. The ESS concept is associated with a small set of canonical publications by John Maynard Smith; OBI represents a decoupling of the use of the phrase and a citation to a John Maynard Smith publication. Across all articles at the record level, OBI is measured by the number of articles with the phrase in the database record but which lack a reference to a source article (implicit citations). At the citation-in-context level, articles that coupled a non-Maynard Smith citation with the ESS phrase (indirect citations) were counted along with those that cited relevant Maynard Smith publications (explicit citations) and OBI counted only based on those articles that lacked any citation coupled with the ESS text phrase. The degree of OBI observed depended on the level of analysis. Record-level OBI trended upward, peaking in 2002 (62%), with a secondary drop and rebound to 53% (2008). Citation-in-context OBI percentages were lower with no clear pattern. Several issues relating to the design of empirical OBI studies are discussed.

In combination with m-nitrobenzyl alcohol, molecular ion charge states that are greater than the number of basic sites in the protein can be produced from these native solutions, even for lysozyme, which is conformationally constrained by four intramolecular disulfide bonds. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that the conformation of ubiquitin is not measurably affected with up to 1.0 M LaCl3, but ion mobility data indicate that the high charge states that are formed when 1.0 mM LaCl3 is present are more unfolded than the low charge states formed without this reagent. These and other results indicate that the increased charging is a result of La3+ preferentially adducting onto compact or more native-like conformers during ESI and the gas-phase ions subsequently unfolding as a result of increased Coulomb repulsion. Electron capture dissociation of these high charge-state ions formed from these native solutions results in comparable sequence coverage to that obtained for ions formed from denaturing solutions without supercharging reagents, making this method a potentially powerful tool for obtaining structural information in native mass spectrometry.

We have developed a novel flow-perfusion bioreactor designed to support lacunocanalicular fluid flow. We hypothesize that ex vivo fluid flow can maintain endochondral bone viability and, ultimately, serve as a novel model to study bone biology in vitro. SpragueDawley rat femurs were harvested, stripped of soft tissue, loaded into a custom-designed bioreactor and perfused with osteogenic culture medium. After 14?days of flow-perfusion or static culture, the bones were harvested, fixed, decalcified, embedded, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Fresh long bone samples were similarly processed for comparison. Osteocyte viability and function were also evaluated, using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT), fluorospectrophotometric DNA quantification, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) colorimetric assay and fluorochrome labelling of mineralizing surfaces. All samples remained free of infection throughout the study period. After 14?days of flow perfusion, histological analysis showed normal-appearing bony architecture, with 72% of lacunae being osteocyte-filled compared with 93% in freshly harvested samples and only 36% in static samples. MTT staining and assay confirmed osteocyte viability in the flow-perfusion samples as well as in fresh samples.

Full thickness 1.5?mm circular defects were created in parietal bones obtained from one litter of 4-day-old CD1 mice. The bones were divided into two groups and embedded with PCL or PCL/PVPA scaffolds. The healing response was evaluated using microcomputed tomography, dissecting microscopy, phase contrast microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. There was a significant increase (P?<?0.05) in bone fill percentage in the presence of the PCL/PVPA scaffold (63.57%) compared with PCL scaffolds (29.64%). The formation of tissue and deposition of extracellular matrix was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. There was evidence of collagen fibre deposition as well as hydroxyapatite and overall woven bone formation. PCL/PVPA scaffolds were better integrated into the defect site. The potential formation of hydroxyapatite was evaluated using energy dispersive spectroscopy. Results showed a significant increase in calcium and phosphorus levels in the presence of PCL/PVPA scaffold. Histological analysis using Masson's trichrome staining confirmed the presence of collagen above and below the PCL/PVPA scaffold within the defect site.

A developmental approach,"Abstract: Chondrogenically differentiating bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) display signs of chondrocyte hypertrophy, such as production of collagen type X, MMP13 and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL). For cartilage reconstructions this is undesirable, as terminally differentiated cartilage produced by BMSCs mineralizes when implanted in vivo. Terminal differentiation is not restricted to BMSCs but is also encountered in chondrogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well as embryonic stem cells, which by definition should be able to generate all types of tissues, including stable cartilage. Therefore, we propose that the currently used culture conditions may drive the cells towards terminal differentiation. In this manuscript we aim to review the literature, supplemented by our own data to answer the question, is it possible to generate stable hyaline cartilage from adult MSCs? We demonstrate that recently published methods for inhibiting terminal differentiation (through PTHrP, MMP13 or blocking phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8) result in cartilage formation with reduction of hypertrophic markers, although this does not reach the low level of stable chondrocytes. A set of hypertrophy markers should be included in future studies to characterize the phenotype more precisely. Finally, we used what is currently known in developmental biology about the differential development of hyaline and terminally differentiated cartilage to provide thought and insights to change current culture models for creating hyaline cartilage. Inhibiting terminal differentiation may not result in stable hyaline cartilage if the right balance of signals has not been created from the start of culture onwards.

In this study, we made use of these variants to identify mutations that confer sensitivity and resistance to the broadly neutralizing antibodies found in the sera of selected HIV-1-infected individuals. For these studies, libraries of Env proteins were cloned from infected subjects and screened for infectivity and neutralization sensitivity. The nucleotide sequences of the Env proteins were then compared for pairs of neutralization-sensitive and -resistant viruses. In vitro mutagenesis was used to identify the specific amino acids responsible for the neutralization phenotype. All of the mutations altering neutralization sensitivity/resistance appeared to induce conformational changes that simultaneously enhanced the exposure of two or more epitopes located in different regions of gp160. These mutations appeared to occur at unique positions required to maintain the quaternary structure of the gp160 trimer, as well as conformational masking of epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Our results show that sequences in gp41, the CD4 binding site, and the V2 domain all have the ability to act as global regulators of neutralization sensitivity.

We determined nest site selection characteristics (n?=?180) and examined spatial patterns (n?=?215) of snowy plover nests in saline lakes in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas. At 104 nests, we examined the influence of substrate type on nest temperatures and heat mitigation. Snowy plover nests were more likely to be found near an object, on pebble substrate, and with fewer plants than random sites. High use areas were generally located in areas with pebble substrate and on human-made or natural islands, berms, and peninsulas. Overall, nests placed on pebble substrate had lower temperatures during the day than nests placed on sand substrates. Nest placement on pebble substrate may be valuable to nesting snowy plovers, providing thermal advantages to incubating adults and depressing potentially high nest predation rates. Management guidelines for this region should emphasize the importance of addressing key elements of snowy plover nesting habitat including the presence of pebble substrate and reducing vegetation encroachment.

We mapped parity mode and the timing of gametogenesis in males and females on a genus-level phylogenetic tree for the family, derived from the literature. For those genera for which reproduction data were not available, we investigated male reproductive activity for representative species using museum material. In addition, we constructed an area cladogram to recover ancestral ranges. Our parsimony analysis retrieved two equally parsimonious solutions for evolutionary transformations in parity mode and reproductive timing in the Cordylidae. Both solutions suggest that oviparity and spring gametogenesis in both males and females (synchronized breeding) is the basal condition in the family. The correlated evolution of viviparity and autumn breeding has been noted in many lizard clades, and we therefore prefer the solution suggesting (1) that the transformations from oviparity to viviparity and from spring to autumn gametogenesis occurred simultaneously in the most recent common ancestor of the Cordylinae, and (2) that a subsequent return to spring spermatogenesis occurred in the most recent common ancestor of the Ouroborus-Karusasaurus-Namazonurus-Hemicordylus-Cordylus clade, a distinctly western clade. The evolution of viviparity and autumn spermatogenesis in the most recent common ancestor of the Cordylinae appears to have been correlated with the onset of cooler climates during the Oligocene while the return to spring spermatogenesis appears to be have been correlated with the aridification of the western parts of southern Africa during the early Miocene.

Membrane perturbation can incur multiple responses in mammalian cells. The present discussion will focus on the interplay between membrane-damaging agents and the function of cell-bound metalloproteinases of the ADAM family. These transmembrane enzymes have emerged as the major proteinase family that mediate the proteolytic release of membrane-associated proteins, a process designated as ""shedding"". They liberate a large spectrum of functionally active molecules including inflammatory cytokines, growth factor receptors and cell adhesion molecules, thereby regulating such vital cellular functions as cell-cell adhesion, cell proliferation and cell migration. ADAM activation may constitute part of the cellular recovery machinery on the one hand, but likely also promotes inflammatory processes on the other. The mechanisms underlying ADAM activation and the functional consequences thereof are currently the subject of intensive research.

Recent work has illuminated a multiplicity of spatially and temporally coordinated virus-host interactions that accompany HBV particle genesis. These interactions include the requirement of cellular chaperones for the maturation of the three viral envelope proteins, the cellular factors involved in dynamic modification, maturation, and intracellular trafficking of the nucleocapsids, and the host components of the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway enabling virion budding at intracellular compartments. Beside infectious virions, HBV produces at least two other types of particles, subviral empty envelope particles and subviral naked capsid particles, likely as a result of the engagement of different host factors by the viral structural proteins. Accordingly, HBV exploits distinct cellular pathways to release its particle types. Here, I review recent progress in these areas of the cell biology of HBV genesis.

These effects facilitate survival of the parasite within the host cell and tend to increase the virulence of disease that includes cerebral malaria and anemia. Numerous proteins secreted by the internalized parasite and interacting with red cell membrane proteins are responsible for the changes occurring to the host cell. Anemia, a serious clinical manifestation of malaria, is due to increased destruction of both infected and uninfected red cells due to membrane alterations, as well as ineffective erythropoiesis. There is very good evidence that various red cell disorders including hemoglobinopathies and hereditary ovalocytosis decrease the virulence of disease following parasite infection.

We designed, fabricated, and characterized a microfluidic-based device for trapping and releasing single beads by controlling elastomeric valves driven by pneumatic pressure and a fluid flow action. The fluid flow is controlled to ensure that beads flowing in a main stream enter into a branch channel. A bead is trapped by deflected elastomeric valves positioned at the entrance of a branch channel. The trapped bead is easily released by removing the applied pressure. The trapping and releasing of single beads of 21 mu m in diameter were successfully performed under an optimized pressure and flow rate ratio. Moreover, we confirmed that continuous trapping and releasing of single beads by repeatedly switching elastomeric valves enables the collection of a controllable number of beads. Our simple method can be integrated into microfluidic systems that require single or multiple particle arrays for quantitative and high-throughput assays in applications within the fields of biology and chemistry.

The research results on space biology have shown that the major mutagenic factors in space are microgravity and ionizing radiation. In addition, possible synergistic effects of radiation and microgravity on human cells are not well understood. In this study, human immortal lymphoblastoid cells were established from human peripheral blood lymphocytes and the cells were treated with low dose (0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 Gy) cumulative Co-60 gamma-irradiation and simulated weightlessness [obtained by culturing cells in the Rotating Cell Culture System (RCCS)]. The commonly used indexes of cell damage such as micronucleus rate, cell cycle and mitotic index were studied. Previous work has proved that Gadd45 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45) gene increases with a dose-effect relationship, and will possibly be a new biological dosimeter to show irradiation damage. So Gadd45 expression is also detected in this study. The micronucleus rate and the expression of Gadd45 alpha gene increased with irradiation dose and were much higher after incubation in the rotating bioreactor than that in the static irradiation group, while the cell proliferation after incubation in the rotating bioreactor decreased at the same time. These results indicate synergetic effects of simulated weightlessness and low dose irradiation in human cells. The cell damage inflicted by gamma-irradiation increased under simulated weightlessness. Our results suggest that during medium- and long-term flight, the human body can be damaged by cumulative low dose radiation, and the damage will even be increased by microgravity in space.

In melanoma, the most aggressive and lethal form of skin cancer, the Brn-2 transcription factor (POU3F2) regulates proliferation and invasiveness and lies downstream from mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Wnt/beta-catenin, two melanoma-associated signaling pathways. In vivo Brn-2 represses expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, MITF, to drive cells to a more stem cell-like and invasive phenotype. Given the key role of Brn-2 in regulating melanoma biology, understanding the signaling pathways that drive Brn-2 expression is an important issue. Here, we show that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling reduces invasiveness of melanoma cells in culture and strongly inhibits Brn-2 expression. Pax3, a transcription factor regulating melanocyte lineage-specific genes, directly binds and regulates the Brn-2 promoter, and Pax3 expression is also decreased upon PI3K inhibition. Collectively, our results highlight a crucial role for PI3K in regulating Brn-2 and Pax3 expression, reveal a mechanism by which PI3K can regulate invasiveness, and imply that PI3K signaling is a key determinant of melanoma subpopulation diversity. Together with our previous work, the results presented here now place Brn-2 downstream of three melanoma-associated signaling pathways.

Divergent selection exerted on ecological traits may result in adaptive population differentiation and reproductive isolation and affect differentially the level of genetic divergence along the genome. Genome-wide scan of large sets of individuals from multiple populations is a powerful approach to identify loci or genomic regions under ecologically divergent selection. Here, we focused on the pea aphid, a species complex of divergent host races, to explore the organization of the genomic divergence associated with host plant adaptation and ecological speciation. We analysed 390 microsatellite markers located at variable distances from predicted genes in replicate samples of sympatric populations of the pea aphid collected on alfalfa, red clover and pea, which correspond to three common host-adapted races reported in this species complex. Using a method that accounts for the hierarchical structure of our data set, we found a set of 11 outlier loci that show higher genetic differentiation between host races than expected under the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. Two of the outliers are close to olfactory receptor genes and three other nearby genes encoding salivary proteins. The remaining outliers are located in regions with genes of unknown functions, or which functions are unlikely to be involved in interactions with the host plant. This study reveals genetic signatures of divergent selection across the genome and provides an inventory of candidate genes responsible for plant specialization in the pea aphid, thereby setting the stage for future functional studies.

We introduce the Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics via RNA-seq (SFG), a document intended to serve as an easy-to-follow protocol, walking a user through one example of high-throughput sequencing data analysis of nonmodel organisms. It is by no means an exhaustive protocol, but rather serves as an introduction to the bioinformatic methods used in population genomics, enabling a user to gain familiarity with basic analysis steps. The SFG consists of two parts. This document summarizes the steps needed and lays out the basic themes for each and a simple approach to follow. The second document is the full SFG, publicly available at http://sfg.stanford.edu, that includes detailed protocols for data processing and analysis, along with a repository of custom-made scripts and sample files. Steps included in the SFG range from tissue collection to de novo assembly, blast annotation, alignment, gene expression, functional enrichment, SNP detection, principal components and FST outlier analyses. Although the technical aspects of population genomics are changing very quickly, our hope is that this document will help population biologists with little to no background in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to more quickly adopt these new techniques.

Punctate PPKs are characterized by circumscribed hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles with considerable heterogeneity. In 18 families with autosomal dominant punctate PPK, we report heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in AAGAB, encoding alpha- and gamma-adaptin binding protein p34, located at a previously linked locus at 15q22. alpha- and gamma-adaptin binding protein p34, a cytosolic protein with a Rab-like GTPase domain, was shown to bind both clathrin adaptor protein complexes, indicating a role in membrane trafficking. Ultrastructurally, lesional epidermis showed abnormalities in intracellular vesicle biology. Immunohistochemistry showed hyperproliferation within the punctate lesions. Knockdown of AAGAB in keratinocytes led to increased cell division, which was linked to greatly elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation. We hypothesize that p34 deficiency may impair endocytic recycling of growth factor receptors such as EGFR, leading to increased signaling and cellular proliferation.

Here we show that ventral-to-dorsal hippocampal subdivisions have specific and sequential functions in trial-and-error maze navigation, with ventral hippocampus (vH) mediating early task-specific goal-oriented searching. Although performance and strategy deployment progressed continuously at the population level, individual mice showed discrete learning phases, each characterized by particular search habits. Transitions in learning phases reflected feedforward inhibitory connectivity (FFI) growth occurring sequentially in ventral, then intermediate, then dorsal hippocampal subdivisions. FFI growth at vH occurred abruptly upon behavioral learning of goal-task relationships. vH lesions or the absence of vH FFI growth delayed early learning and disrupted performance consistency. Intermediate hippocampus lesions impaired intermediate place learning, whereas dorsal hippocampus lesions specifically disrupted late spatial learning. Trial-and-error navigational learning processes in naive mice thus involve a stereotype sequence of increasingly precise subtasks learned through distinct hippocampal subdivisions. Because of its unique connectivity, vH may relate specific goals to internal states in learning under healthy and pathological conditions.

It is a key component of both energy and signal transduction - processes that undergo crucial changes in cancer cells. NAD(+)-dependent signalling pathways are many and varied, and they regulate fundamental events such as transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and metabolism. Many of these processes have been linked to cancer development. Given that NAD(+)-dependent signalling reactions involve the degradation of the molecule, permanent nucleotide resynthesis through different biosynthetic pathways is crucial for incessant cancer cell proliferation.

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows cells, and the macromolecular assemblies contained within, to be reconstructed in situ, at a resolution of 2-6 nm.

In addition, PDGFRA has been recently shown to be rearranged in glioblastoma. However, the frequency, cooccurrence, and clinical value of PDGFRA abnormalities in diffuse gliomas remain unclear. We investigated PDGFRA abnormalities and their clinical impact on 619 primary diffuse gliomas, including 167 grade II, 168 grade III, and 284 grade IV gliomas, with use of BAC-aCGH and validated our findings by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We studied PDGFRA expression using reverse-transcription quantitative PCR in 84 gliomas and 12 non-tumor samples. In 138 samples, we also screened PDGFRA point mutations in exons 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 23; presence of KDR-PDGFRA fusion gene; and PDGFRA truncation. PDGFRA was amplified and gained in 5.2 and 1.9 of samples, respectively. In addition PDGFRA was point-mutated, rearranged, and truncated in 2.9, 0, and 0.7 of cases, respectively. PDGFRA point mutations were observed exclusively in grade IV gliomas and in 12.5 of PDGFRA-amplified tumors. High-level PDGFRA amplification was associated with PDGFRA overexpression, high malignancy grade, and older patient age. Of interest, high-level PDGFRA amplification has an independent negative prognostic value for progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with grade III tumors. PDGFRA is altered through various genetic mechanisms in a subset of high-grade gliomas in patients who might be ideal candidates for PDGFRA inhibitor treatment, and PDGFRA gene amplification could be used as a prognostic biomarker in anaplastic gliomas.

Ethyl acetate extracts (IC50 = 257.081 mu g/ml) were the most active to inhibit the growth of G. intestinalis followed by aqueous extract (PWE), saponins, and n-butanol extract. The PWE and ethyl acetate extract inhibited G. intestinalis trophozoites adherence after 3 h of incubation and killed almost 50 % of the parasite population in a time-dependent manner. Changes in morphology, presence of precipitates in the cytoplasm, dissolved cytoplasm with large vacuole, break of flagella and ventral disk, membrane blebs, and intracellular and nuclear clearance of the treated trophozoites were observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrated that P. chinensis induced these changes in G. intestinalis morphology and consequently has potential therapeutic use against giardiasis.

In this way, it is known that mosquito larvae and free-living amoebae (FLA) normally occupy similar aquatic microhabitats. However, few studies have been conducted about such coexistence. For that reason, the objective of the present study was to verify the prevalence of Acanthamoeba spp. in wild populations of Aedes aegypti, as well as to characterize the genotypic lineage, and their possible pathogenicity through thermo- and osmotolerance. Amoebae were investigated in 60 pools, each containing ten larvae of A. aegypti, collected in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). The Acanthamoeba isolates were morphologically characterized and submitted to the polymerase chain reaction technique to confirm identification of the genus. In addition, genotype analyses as well as tests for presumptive pathogenicity in some samples were performed. Of the 60 pools examined, 54 (90 %) were positive for FLA. Of these isolates, 47 (87 %) belonged to the genus Acanthamoeba. The genotypic groups T4, T3 and T5 were identified, numbering 14 (53.8 %), ten (38.5 %) and two (7.7 %) isolates, respectively. The physiological tests performed with 14 strains showed that 12 (85.7 %) were non-pathogenic, while two (14.3 %) were considered as having low pathogenic potential. These results provide a basis for a better understanding of the interaction between these protozoan and mosquitoes in their natural habitat.

It is noted that reductionism, specialisation and modularity are basic prerequisites for understanding life. It is realised that increased progress of scientific biology in elucidating mechanisms at the level of modular components supports the accusation that the more it advances in materialistic description of details, the more it diverts from understanding the innate properties of life. It is clear that modularity, by taking the whole as the sum of its parts, is insufficient for understanding living systems. At the same time, however, there is emergence, as advocated by Robert Laughlin. Emergence after the integration of modules leads to completely new properties of individual organisms as unique unitary entities, and also of systems of organisms with synergistic and antagonistic interactions of the integrated species. The discussion is predominantly based on examples from plant biology. At hierarchically higher scalar levels emergent biological systems are networks integrating species, biotopes, ecosystems and the entire biosphere of Earth, also named Gaia by James Lovelock, in a natural scientific respect. While investigating modules remains essential, biology as a nature science needs to merge and integrate such information to be able to unfold emergence. Through efforts towards visualising and understanding emergent diversity and complexity, the research discipline of biology will provide invaluable contributions to understanding life, and thus refute the accusation that it diverts from embracing the innate properties of life.

Our objective was to investigate: (1) the distribution pattern of flowers in inflorescences of Rhynchospora ciliata; (2) the dynamics of its anthesis; and (3) whether R. ciliata is pollinated by bees, by wind or by both. Additionally, we tested the hypotheses: (i) the hypsophylls and/or anthers attract pollinators, and (ii) biotic vectors enhance the reproductive success of R. ciliata. We analysed floral biology, dynamics of anthesis, frequency and behaviour of insects visiting flowers; we also carried out experiments on flower attractiveness, pollination by wind and reproductive success. Rhynchospora ciliata has flowers with anemophilous attributes, including anthers exposed during anthesis; however, the anthers (here considered a mixed trait) together with the white hypsophylls can be considered as attributes that favour entomophily. Both wind and four species of bee were considered as pollen vectors of R. ciliata. Through flower attractiveness tests, we observed that the hypsophylls do not affect the frequency of pollinating bees and that the absence of exposed anthers affects the average number of visits, probably because pollen is the only floral resource. Reproductive tests indicate that R. ciliata is self-incompatible and that ambophily enhances its reproductive success.

Seed priming is used to induce pre-germinative metabolism and then enhance germination efficiency and crop yields. It has been hypothesized that priming treatments might also improve stress tolerance in germinating seeds, leaving a sort of 'stress memory'. However, the molecular bases of priming still need to be clarified and the identification of molecular indicators of seed vigor is nowadays a relevant goal for the basic and applied research in seed biology. It is generally acknowledged that enhanced seed vigor and successful priming depend on DNA repair mechanisms, activated during imbibition. The complexity of the networks of DNA damage control/repair functions has been only partially elucidated in plants and the specific literature that address seeds remains scanty.

Enzymes participating in biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and components of JA signaling have been extensively characterized by biochemical and molecular-genetic tools. Mutants have helped to define the pathway for synthesis of jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the bioactive form of JA, and to identify the F-box protein COI1 as central regulatory unit. Details on the molecular mechanism of JA signaling were recently unraveled by the discovery of JAZ proteins that together with the adaptor protein NINJA and the general co-repressor TOPLESS form a transcriptional repressor complex. The current model of JA perception and signaling implies the SCFCOI1 complex operating as E3 ubiquitin ligase that upon binding of JA-Ile targets JAZ proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby allowing MYC2 and other transcription factors to activate gene expression. Chemical strategies, as integral part of jasmonate research, have helped the establishment of structure-activity relationships and the discovery of (+)-7-iso-JA-l-Ile as the major bioactive form of the hormone. The transient nature of its accumulation highlights the need to understand catabolism and inactivation of JA-Ile and recent studies indicate that oxidation of JA-Ile by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is the major mechanism for turning JA signaling off. Plants contain numerous JA metabolites, which may have pronounced and differential bioactivity.

We describe a new distribution model that employs machine learning software and geographic information systems to model storm-petrel distribution. We used environmental predictor variables that included newly available climatologies of sea surface DMS concentrations to construct distribution maps of fork-tailed storm-petrel (Oceanodroma furcata) and Leach's storm-petrel (O. leucorhoa) in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. Model accuracy was assessed by (1) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and (2) comparing predicted distributions to presence and non-detection data from two opportunistic pelagic surveys performed in summer 2008. Models using all predictor variables gave AUC values of 0.89 and 0.75, sensitivity values of 0.73 and 0.61, and specificity values of 0.83 and 0.73 for fork-tailed and Leach's storm-petrel, respectively.

The large-scale link between DMS and how storm-petrels use it to locate foraging areas was reinforced by the partial dependence of DMS on the relative index of occurrence (RIO) of storm-petrels, and by a decrease in AUC values when removing DMS as a predictor.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that folate confers a modest protection against CRC risk. However, the relationship is complex, and evidence from human intervention trials and animal studies suggests that a high-dose of folic acid supplementation may enhance the risk of colorectal carcinogenesis in certain circumstances. The molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent dual modulatory effect of folate on colorectal carcinogenesis are not fully understood. Folate is central to C-1 metabolism and is needed for both DNA synthesis and DNA methylation, providing plausible biological mechanisms through which folate could modulate cancer risk. Aberrant DNA methylation is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis and is typically associated with the transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Folate is required for the production of S-adenosyl methionine, which serves as a methyl donor for DNA methylation events; thereby folate availability is proposed to modulate DNA methylation status. The evidence for an effect of folate on DNA methylation in the human colon is limited, but a modulation of DNA methylation in response to folate has been demonstrated. More research is required to clarify the optimum intake of folate for CRC prevention and to elucidate the effect of folate availability on DNA methylation and the associated impact on CRC biology.

By proliferating and mechanically interacting with each other, cells can build complex organization such as tissues that ultimately organize into even more complex multicellular living organisms, such as mammals, composed of billions of single cells interacting with each other. As opposed to passive materials, living cells actively respond to the mechanical perturbations occurring in their environment. Tissue cell adhesion to its surrounding extracellular matrix or to neighbors is an example of a biological process that adapts to physical cues. The adhesion of tissue cells to their surrounding medium induces the generation of intracellular contraction forces whose amplitude adapts to the mechanical properties of the environment. In turn, solicitation of adhering cells with physical forces, such as blood flow shearing the layer of endothelial cells in the lumen of arteries, reinforces cell adhesion and impacts cell contractility. In biological terms, the sensing of physical signals is transduced into biochemical signaling events that guide cellular responses such as cell differentiation, cell growth and cell death. Regarding the biological and developmental consequences of cell adaptation to mechanical perturbations, understanding mechanotransduction in tissue cell adhesion appears as an important step in numerous fields of biology, such as cancer, regenerative medicine or tissue bioengineering for instance. Physicists were first tempted to view cell adhesion as the wetting transition of a soft bag having a complex, adhesive interaction with the surface. But surprising responses of tissue cell adhesion to mechanical cues challenged this view. This, however, did not exclude that cell adhesion could be understood in physical terms. It meant that new models and descriptions had to be created specifically for these biological issues, and could not straightforwardly be adapted from dead matter. In this review, we present physical concepts of tissue cell adhesion and the unexpected cellular responses to mechanical cues such as external forces and stiffness sensing. We show how biophysical approaches, both experimentally and theoretically, have contributed to our understanding of the regulation of cellular functions through physical force sensing mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the different physical models that could explain how tissue cell adhesion and force sensing can be coupled to internal mechanosensitive processes within the cell body.

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) allows us to employ the whole Bayesian formalism to problems where we can use simulations from a model, but cannot evaluate the likelihood directly. When summary statistics of real and simulated data are compared-rather than the data directly-information is lost, unless the summary statistics are sufficient. Sufficient statistics are, however, not common but without them statistical inference in ABC inferences are to be considered with caution. Previously other authors have attempted to combine different statistics in order to construct (approximately) sufficient statistics using search and information heuristics. Here we employ an information-theoretical framework that can be used to construct appropriate (approximately sufficient) statistics by combining different statistics until the loss of information is minimized. We start from a potentially large number of different statistics and choose the smallest set that captures (nearly) the same information as the complete set. We then demonstrate that such sets of statistics can be constructed for both parameter estimation and model selection problems, and we apply our approach to a range of illustrative and real-world model selection problems.

The derivation of validated ESCs lines is a necessary step if the generation of economically relevant transgenic animals is to be achieved. However, this is still elusive, as the isolation of true ESCs lines for livestock has not been accomplished to date. It has been demonstrated that by forced expression of a defined set of transcription factors, it is possible to reprogram somatic cells to cells that closely resemble an ES-like state. These cells were termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We introduce the basic concepts relating to stem cell biology and give an overview of the various attempts to isolate and generate pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from species relevant to livestock production. Further, we point out the issues to be addressed and hurdles to be overcome to realize the promise of stem cells in agriculture. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This makes them a promising cell of choice for studying a variety of biological processes, toxicity assays, biomaterial-cell interaction studies, as well as in tissue-engineering applications. In this study, we report the generation of two clones of SV40-immortalized EPCs from umbilical cord blood. These cells retained most of the functional features of mature endothelial cells and showed no indication of senescence after repeated culture for more than 240 days. Extensive functional characterization of the immortalized cells by western blot, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence studies substantiated that these cells retained their ability to synthesize nitric oxide, von Willebrand factor, P-Selectin etc. These cells achieved unlimited proliferation potential subsequent to inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, but failed to form colonies on soft agar. We also show their enhanced growth and survival on vascular biomaterials compared to parental cultures in late population doubling. These immortalized EPCs can be used as a cellular model system for studying the biology of these cells, gene manipulation experiments, cell-biomaterial interactions, as well as a variety of tissue-engineering applications.

Although a basal rate of glucose metabolism occurs in all cells, the processing rates of glucose can become dramatically enhanced when cells acquire malignant properties, or remain undifferentiated. This article investigates the consequences of how increased glucose metabolism affects cellular physiology by altering the physicochemical properties of the whole metabolic network. As a result, enhanced lactate production in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect) is required, and metabolism is consequently reconfigured, through multiple mechanisms, to confer numerous physiological and possibly regulatory properties to cells.

Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression is increased and facilitates lactate production in cancer cells. Modulation of PKM2 catalytic activity also regulates the synthesis of DNA and lipids that are required for cell proliferation, and of NADPH that is required for redox homeostasis. In addition to its role as a pyruvate kinase, PKM2 also functions as a protein kinase and as a transcriptional coactivator. These biochemical activities are controlled by allosteric regulators and post-translational modifications of PKM2 that include acetylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, prolyl hydroxylation, and sumoylation. Given its pleiotropic effects on cancer biology, PKM2 represents an attractive target for cancer therapy.

An Ecological Critique,"Abstract: The energy and material flows of a city are often described as urban metabolism (UM), which is put forward as a way to link a city's ecology and economy. UM draws parallels to the biology of individual organisms, yet the analogy is misapplied. In striving to be interdisciplinary, UM makes this organismic comparison rather than identifying the city as an ecosystem, thereby ignoring developments in ecological theory. Using inappropriate rhetoric misdirects researchers, which influences scientific investigation-from problem statements to interpretations. UM is valuable in quantifying the city's use of natural resources but does not achieve a comprehensive, integrated analysis of the urban ecosystem. To realize an interdisciplinary, perhaps transdisciplinary, understanding of urban ecology, researchers need to emphasize the essential tenets of material flows analysis, view the city as an ecosystem, and use language that properly reflects current knowledge, theory, and conceptual frameworks in the foundational disciplines.

Some studies also implicate a suboptimal vitamin A intake in certain parts of the population of the industrialized world. Provitamin A carotenoids such as beta-carotene are the major source for retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) in the human diet. However, it is still controversial how much beta-carotene intake is required and safe. An important contributor to this uncertainty is the lack of knowledge about the biochemical and molecular basis of beta-carotene metabolism. Recently, key players of provitamin A metabolism have been molecularly identified and biochemically characterized. Studies in knockout mouse models showed that intestinal beta-carotene absorption and conversion to retinoids is under negative feedback regulation that adapts this process to the actual requirement of vitamin A of the body. These studies also showed that in peripheral tissues a conversion of beta-carotene occurs and affects retinoid-dependent physiologic processes. Moreover, these analyses provided a possible explanation for the adverse health effects of carotenoids by showing that a pathologic accumulation of these compounds can induce oxidative stress in mitochondria and cell signaling pathways related to disease. Genetic polymorphisms in identified genes exist in humans and also alter carotenoid homeostasis. Here, the advanced knowledge of beta-carotene metabolism is reviewed, which provides a molecular framework for understanding the role of this important micronutrient in health and disease.

In this study, the development, nymphal and adult feeding, adult behavior, and mate encounter mechanisms of this species are investigated. This species inhabits a stream flowing through a cave, in darkness and at a constant temperature. Nymphs of different sizes cohabit throughout the whole year, showing a nonseasonal life cycle. Nymphs at the entrance of the cave feed mainly on coarse particulate organic matter and hyphae, and nymphs at the end of the cave feed principally on detritus and occasionally on animal matter. Adults were present year-round and aggregated on emergent stones at the end of the cave. No drumming signals were recorded; therefore, this species seems to rely mainly on aggregation to maximize pair encounters. As shown in this study, P. gevi have adaptations suited to life in the dark and the completion of its entire life cycle inside a cave.

We examined the impact of sibling fusion on ontogenetic shifts in offspring size in the brooding sea anemone Urticina felina. Fusion occurred among brood-protected embryos in U. felina, whereas it occurred postrelease among settlers of corals studied here and previously. Two fusion products were evidenced: morphologically aberrant offspring and large homogeneous offspring coined ""megalarvae."" The frequent occurrence (similar to 77%) of megalarvae identifies them as the primary fusion product, which drove an increase in offspring size and within-clutch size variation before release. Lipid signatures suggest that morphologically aberrant juveniles represent by-products that do not reach adulthood. Not only were occurrences of megalarvae common in the populations studied, they increased with maternal fecundity, suggesting that sibling fusion may be a form of kin cooperation integral to the reproductive success of U. felina, warranting investigation in other live-bearing invertebrate taxa.

However, standardized measurement techniques are needed.Aim: This study compared three techniques for segmental analysis (T1, conventional electrode measurement; T2, use of a novel additional switching unit; T3, equipotentials instead of switching unit) which are often used in population biology.Subjects and methods: The techniques were compared in 124 healthy adults (19-83 years) using a tetrapolar bioimpedance analyser (Nutriguard-M) at multiple frequencies (5, 50, 100 kHz) to gain whole-body and segmental resistances, reactances and phase angles.Results: Repeated measures ANOVA yielded a significant technique effect for most variables (26/27), a significant interaction technique x sex for half (13/27), and a significant interaction technique x age for a quarter (7/27) of variables.Conclusions: Differences exist between the three techniques which are primarily caused by inconsistent current pathways. A comparison with literature data showed that, in addition, subject's posture during measurement, electrode contact and electrode site may lead to inconsistent resistance and reactance values. This makes comparisons between different populations difficult. Therefore, this study recommends generally using the T2 technique which is standardized, easy to use and, thereby, well suited for field studies in large population groups.

IDOL expression is controlled at the transcriptional level by the cholesterol-sensing nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR). In response to rising cellular sterol levels, activated LXR induces IDOL production, thereby limiting further uptake of exogenous cholesterol through the LDLR pathway. The LXR-IDOL-LDLR mechanism for feedback inhibition of cholesterol uptake is independent of and complementary to the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway. Since the initial description of the LXR-IDOL pathway, biochemical studies have helped to define the structural basis for both IDOL target recognition and LDLR ubiquitin transfer. Recent work has also suggested links between IDOL and human lipid metabolism. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2012;32:2541-2546.)

Thrombin also activated Grb2-associated binder protein 1, p115 Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rac1, RhoA, and p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) and interference with stimulation of these molecules attenuated thrombin-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. In addition, adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant negative Pyk2 inhibited thrombin-induced Grb2-associated binder protein 1, p115 rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rac1, RhoA and Pak1 stimulation. Balloon injury also caused activation of Pyk2, Grb2-associated binder protein 1, p115 rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rac1, RhoA, and Pak1 in the carotid artery of rat, and these responses were sensitive to inhibition by the dominant negative Pyk2. Furthermore, inhibition of Pyk2 activation resulted in reduced recruitment of smooth muscle cells onto the luminal surface and their proliferation in the intimal region leading to suppression of neointima formation.Conclusion-Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that Pyk2 plays a crucial role in G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell growth and migration, as well as balloon injury-induced neointima formation.

Here, we investigate the role of Krev interaction-trapped 1 (KRIT1), an adherens junction accessory protein required for cell-cell junction stability, in regulating these vascular functions.Methods and Results-Krit1(+/-) mice exhibited an enhanced edematous response to the complex inflammatory stimuli found in the passive K/BxN model of inflammatory arthritis and the murine air pouch model, yet leukocyte infiltration was unchanged. Correspondingly, reduced KRIT1 expression increased baseline arteriole and venule permeability 2-fold over that of wild-type littermates, as measured by intravital microscopy of the intact cremaster muscle vascular network, but this increase was not accompanied by increased leukocyte extravasation or activation. Direct stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced increased permeability in wild-type mice, but surprisingly no increase over baseline levels was observed in Krit1(+/-) mice, despite extensive leukocyte activation. Finally, adoptive transfer of Krit1(+/-) bone marrow failed to increase permeability in wild-type mice. However, reduced expression of KRIT1 in the hematopoietic lineage dampened the differences observed in baseline permeability.Conclusion-Taken together, our data indicate an integral role for KRIT1 in microvessel homeostasis and the vascular response to inflammation.

Tianzhu White yak is a unique breed developed from a very small number of mutant founders and its white hair has a special niche market value. In this study, the genetic polymorphisms in Tyrosinase (TYR) gene, which has been considered as a 'albino locus' in cattle, were identified and characterized to search for alleles associated with the white coat colour in yak. A total of 973 yak samples were collected, including 438 animals from five nucleus breeding herds and 365 individuals from four reproductive herds of the Tianzhu White yak. The reference TYR genomic DNA sequence derived from a Hereford bull was used to design all primers for screening and sequencing the exon 2 and the last partial 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the yak TYR gene. Both PCR-SSCP analysis and DNA sequences for their complete exon 2 in selected samples from the Tianzhu White yak herds and black yak populations identified a single conserved sequence identical to other cattle breeds. There were 14 genotypes and seven alleles defined by nucleotide polymorphisms present in the 215 bp long 5'-UTR of yak TYR gene among all yak samples, of which five alleles were specific to yak while the other two alleles were of a cattle origin. Although, current data Suggested no association of these polymorphisms with the yak coat colour variations, they shed light on the potential function of the promoter on regulation of expression of yak TYR gene that is warranted to screen for additional polymorphisms in its extended 5'-UTR and other exons.

Polymeric chains assembled from covalently-linked Ub monomers function as molecular signals in the regulation of a host of cellular processes. Our previous studies have shown that the predominant state of Lys48-linked di- and tetra-Ub chains at near-physiological conditions is a closed conformation, in which the Ub-Ub interface is formed by the hydrophobic surface residues of the adjacent Ub units. Because these very residues are involved in (poly)Ub interactions with the majority of Ub-binding proteins, their sequestration at the Ub-Ub interface renders the closed conformation of polyUb binding incompetent. Thus the existence of open conformation(s) and the interdomain motions opening and closing the Ub-Ub interface is critical for the recognition of Lys48-linked polyUb by its receptors. Knowledge of the conformational properties of a polyUb signal is essential for our understanding of its specific recognition by various Ub-receptors. Despite their functional importance, open states of Lys48-linked chains are poorly characterized. Here we report a crystal structure of the open state of Lys48-linked di-Ub. Moreover, using NMR, we examined interactions of the open state of this chain (at pH4.5) with a Lys48-linkage-selective receptor, the UBA2 domain of a shuttle protein hHR23a. Our results show that di-Ub binds UBA2 in the same mode and with comparable affinity as the closed state. Our data suggest a mechanism for polyUb signal recognition, whereby Ub-binding proteins select specific conformations out of the available ensemble of polyUb chain conformations.

Here, it is argued that cellular life involves (i) inevitable accumulation of damage resulting from imperfectness and heterogeneity of every cellular process, and (ii) dilution of damage when cells divide. While severe damage is cleared by protective systems, milder damage can only be diluted. This is due to the high cost of accuracy, the greater number of damage forms compared to protective systems, and the constraints on cellular life inherited from the prokaryotic world. This strategy also applies to cancer cells, which are particularly dependent on damage dilution. Imposing restriction on cell division necessarily leads to aging. Interventions that extend lifespan act through metabolic reprogramming, thereby changing both damage composition and the rate of damage accumulation. Thus, heterogeneity leading to myriad mild damage forms represents the cause of aging, whereas the processes that affect the damage landscape and damage accumulation are lifespan regulators.

Here we aim at developing small chimeric proteins, displaying the extracellular ligand-binding motifs of a human GPCR, the Y receptor. This allows the study of ligand-receptor interactions in simplified systems. We present comprehensive information on the use of transmembrane (OmpA) and soluble (Blc) beta-barrel scaffolds. Whereas Blc appeared to be not fully compatible with our approach, owing to problems with refolding of the hybrid constructs, loop-grafted versions of OmpA delivered encouraging results. Previously, we described a chimeric construct based on OmpA displaying all three extracellular Y1 receptor loops in different topologies and showing moderate affinity to one of the natural ligands. Now, we present detailed data on the interaction of these constructs with several Y receptor ligands along with data on new constructs. Our findings suggest a common binding mode for all ligands, which is mediated through the C-terminal residues of the peptide ligand, supporting the functional validity of these hybrid receptors. The observed binding affinities, however, are well below those observed for the natural receptors, clearly indicating limitations in mimicking the natural systems.

Twenty-two reciprocally monophyletic sister-species pairs were identified: 64% were allopatric, and the remainder were sympatric. Age of divergence was similar for allopatric and sympatric species pairs. Sympatric sister pairs displayed greater divergence in morphology, ecology, and sexually dimorphic colour patterns than did allopatric pairs, suggesting that both genetic drift in allopatric species pairs and ecologically adaptive divergence between members of sympatric pairs have played a role in diversification. Basal species typically have small geographical ranges and are restricted to geographically and ecologically peripheral reef habitats. We found little evidence that a single dominant process has driven diversification, nor did we detect a pattern of discrete, sequential stages of diversification in relation to habitat, ecology, and reproductive biology.

Such cells can use a number of cell behaviors including contractility, proliferation, and directed movement to create these structures. By contrast, tissue engineers and researchers in regenerative medicine seeking to produce organs for repair or replacement therapy can combine cells with synthetic polymeric scaffolds. Tissue engineers try to achieve these goals by shaping scaffold geometry in such a way that cells embedded within these scaffold self-assemble to form a tissue, for instance aligning to synthetic fibers, and assembling native extracellular matrix to form the desired tissue-like structure. Although self-assembly is a dominant process that guides tissue assembly both within the embryo and within artificial tissue constructs, we know little about these critical processes.

The embryonic vasculature develops not only in the context of these biochemical cues, but also in the context of the biomechanical forces imparted by blood flow. In the mature vasculature, different blood flow regimes induce distinct genetic programs, and significant progress has been made toward understanding how these forces are perceived by endothelial cells and transduced into biochemical signals. However, it cannot be assumed that paradigms that govern the mature vasculature are pertinent to the developing embryonic vasculature. The embryonic vasculature can respond to the mechanical forces of blood flow, and these responses are critical in vascular remodeling, certain aspects of sprouting angiogenesis, and maintenance of arterial-venous identity. Here, we review data regarding mechanistic aspects of endothelial cell mechanotransduction, with a focus on the response to shear stress, and elaborate upon the multifarious effects of shear stress on the embryonic vasculature. In addition, we discuss emerging predictive vascular growth models and highlight the prospect of combining signaling pathway information with computational modeling.

Understanding how these differences arise requires knowing how they are generated in the embryo. Growing evidence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) suggests that morphological differences between species result largely from changes in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression during development. Corresponding changes in functional cellular behaviors (morphogenetic mechanisms) are only beginning to be explored, however. Here we show that spatiotemporal patterns of tissue contractility are sufficient to explain differences in morphology of the early embryonic brain between disparate species. We found that enhancing cytoskeletal contraction in the embryonic chick brain with calyculin A alters the distribution of contractile proteins on the apical side of the neuroepithelium and changes relatively round cross-sections of the tubular brain into shapes resembling triangles, diamonds, and narrow slits. These perturbed shapes, as well as overall brain morphology, are remarkably similar to those of corresponding sections normally found in species such as zebrafish and Xenopus laevis (frog). Tissue staining revealed relatively strong concentration of F-actin at vertices of hyper-contracted cross-sections, and a finite element model shows that local contraction in these regions can convert circular sections into the observed shapes. Another model suggests that these variations in contractility depend on the initial geometry of the brain tube, as localized contraction may be needed to open the initially closed lumen in normal zebrafish and Xenopus brains, whereas this contractile machinery is not necessary in chick brains, which are already open when first created. We conclude that interspecies differences in cytoskeletal contraction may play a larger role in generating differences in morphology, and at much earlier developmental stages, in the brain than previously appreciated.

Expression of the normally repressed L1 retrotransposons has been shown to induce genome instability by creating DNA double-stranded breaks and chromosomal rearrangements through the process of retrotransposition. At present, little is known about the expression of L1-encoded ORF1p and ORF2p which are indispensable for its retrotransposition activity. Given its potentially harmful effects on the genome, we investigated the implications of both ORF1p and ORF2p expression and their subcellular localization in a range of breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissues including 15 normal breast tissues, 25 fibroadenomas, 25 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 95 invasive cancers. Clinicopathologic parameters and survival outcomes were investigated in association with the cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of ORF1p and ORF2p using univariate and multivariate analysis. High cytoplasmic expression of ORF1p and ORF2p was seen in DCIS tumors, but they were not related with survival outcome. The majority of invasive cancers were found to express both ORF1p and ORF2p in the cytoplasm, while nuclear expression was also seen in a subclass of those invasive cancers in the range of 28-31 %. Tumors with high nuclear expression of ORF1p and ORF2p were more significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001) and the worst patient survival (p < 0.0001) than those with cytoplasmic expression. This is the first study examining the effects of both ORF1p and ORF2p expression in breast cancer tissues. Our observation shows altered expression patterns of ORF1p and ORF2p within invasive cancers, which are related to differences in overall patient survival. The differing patterns of both cytoplasmic and nuclear ORF1p and ORF2p expression indicate that further studies of the biology and function of L1 retrotransposons are required in breast cancer.

The Framingham study and others that followed could show that HDL-C is an independent cardiovascular risk factor and that the increase of HDL-C of only 10 mg center dot L-1 leads to a risk reduction of 23%. While statin therapy and therefore low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction could lower coronary heart disease considerably; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality still occur in a significant portion of subjects already receiving therapy. Therefore, new strategies and therapies are needed to further reduce the risk. Raising HDL-C was thought to achieve this goal. However, established drug therapies resulting in substantial HDL-C increase are scarce and their effect is controversial. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that HDL particle functionality is at least as important as HDL-C levels since HDL particles not only promote reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery (mainly macrophages) to the liver but also exert pleiotropic effects on inflammation, haemostasis and apoptosis. This review deals with the biology of HDL particles, the established and future therapeutic options to increase HDL-C and discusses the results and conclusions of the most important studies published in the last years. Finally, an outlook on future diagnostic tools and therapeutic opportunities regarding coronary artery disease is given.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, 22-25 nucleotides, endogenously expressed noncoding RNA. miRNAs are important genetic regulators: one miRNA can possibly target multiple genes and they can function as tumor promoters (oncogenic miRNAs, oncomirs) or tumor suppressors (anti-oncomirs). Therefore, the identification of misregulated miRNAs in cellular signaling pathways related to oncogenesis can have profound implications for cancer therapy. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) converts epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a normal embryological process that frequently get activated during cancer invasion and metastasis. Recent evidence also supports the presence of a small subset of self-renewing, stem-like cells within the tumor mass that possess the capacity to seed new tumors and they have been termed 'cancer stem cells (CSC)'. Conceivably, these CSCs could provide a resource for cells that cause therapy resistance. Although the cell origin of CSCs remains to be fully elucidated, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that the biology of EMT and CSCs is tightly linked with the sequences and compositions of miRNA molecules. Therefore, targeting miRNAs involved in EMT and CSCs regulation can provide novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies in oncology.

The most common form of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. A diagnostic biomarker for Graves' disease is the presence of immunoglobulins which bind to, and stimulate, the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). We hypothesized that the ectopically expressed TSHR gene in a thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) assay could be engineered to increase the accumulation of the GPCR pathway second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP), the molecule measured in the assay as a marker for pathway activation. An ectopically expressing TSHR-mutant guanine nucleotide-binding protein, (GNAS) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clone was constructed using standard molecular biology techniques. After incubation of the new clone with sera containing various levels of TSI, GPCR pathway activation was then quantified by measuring cAMP accumulation in the clone. The clone, together with a NaCl-free cell assay buffer containing 5% polyethylene glycol (PEG)6000, was tested against 56 Graves' patients, 27 toxic thyroid nodule patients and 119 normal patients. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, when comparing normal with Graves' sera, the assay yielded a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 99% and an efficiency of 98%. Total complex precision (within-run, across runs and across days), presented as a percentage coefficient of variation, was found to be 7.8, 8.7 and 7.6% for low, medium and high TSI responding serum, respectively. We conclude that the performance of the new TSI assay provides sensitive detection of TSI, allowing for accurate, early detection of Graves' disease.

HTLV infection affects host's ocular tolerance and causes various diseases in the eye. Here we discuss the manifestations, mechanisms, treatments, and future directions of HTLV-related ocular diseases.Recent finingsRecent serological researches showed that the number of HTLV-1 carriers in metropolitan area was increasing, although seroprevalence of HTLV-1 in general population was decreased after screening serological tests in blood donors started. The most common clinical entity of uveitis was still HTLV-1 uveitis in HTLV-1 highly endemic area, but prevalence of HTLV-1 uveitis varies in different parts of the world. As for treatment of inflammation, tacrolimus and 5-azacytidine were reported to be effective for autoimmune manifestations in HTLV-1-related overlap syndrome (deratomyositis/Sjogren's syndrome) and HTLV-1-related myelodysplastic syndrome. Interleukin-2 receptor targeted therapies improved scleritis in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma caused by HTLV-1. Basic researches identified that HTLV-1 tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor play critical roles in the HTLV-1-related disease and are now being investigated as targeted therapies.SummaryDevelopment of modern molecular biology makes it possible to reveal deep insights of HTLV-1-related ocular diseases. Although effective therapies based on basic researches have been reported, further endeavor is necessary to establish much more specific treatments of the ocular diseases.

Here, we report the characterization of a Klf4 homologue in Xenopus laevis during embryogenesis. Klf4 is transcribed both maternally and zygotically and the transcript is ubiquitous in embryos during germ-layer formation. Klf4 promotes endoderm differentiation in both Nodal/Activin-dependent and -independent manners. Moreover, Klf4 regulates anteroposterior body axis patterning via activation of a subset of genes in the Spemann organizer, such as Noggin, Dkk1 and Cerberus, which encode Nodal, Wnt and BMP antagonists. Loss of Klf4 function leads to the failure of germ-layer differentiation, the loss of responsiveness of early embryonic cells to inducing signals, e. g. Nodal/Activin, and the loss of transcription of genes involved in axis patterning. We conclude that Klf4 is required for germ-layer differentiation and body axis patterning by means of rendering early embryonic cells competent to differentiation signals.

Besides direct clearance, hydrological alterations, climatic changes or insect infestations, chemical pollution could be a significant contributor of mangrove degradation. The present paper reviews the current knowledge on the occurrence, bioavailability and toxic effects of trace contaminants in mangrove ecosystems. The literature confirmed that trace metals, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Endocrine Disrupters Compounds (EDCs) have been detected in various mangrove compartments (water, sediments and biota). In some cases, these chemicals have associated toxic effects on mangrove ecosystem species, with potential impact on populations and biodiversity in the field. However, nearly all studies about the bioavailability and toxic effects of contaminants in mangrove ecosystems focus on selected trace metals, PAHs or some ""conventional"" POPs, and virtually no data exist for other contaminant groups. The specificities of mangrove ecosystems (e.g. biology, physico-chemistry and hydrology) support the need for specific ecotoxicological tools. This review highlights the major data and methodological gaps which should be addressed to refine the risk assessment of trace pollutants in mangrove ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, two proteins involved in vascular calcification; serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and tumour necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) have emerged as potentially useful biomarkers. OPG levels are positively correlated with CV risk, whereas TRAIL levels show a negative correlation. Exercise training is known to reduce risk factors for CV disease by improving metabolism, vascular biology and blood flow. This study examined the effects of a 6-month exercise training programme on levels of OPG and TRAIL. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured for comparative purposes. Materials and methods Overweight and obese patients undertook a 6-month exercise programme. Patients participated in 4 h of primarily aerobic exercise per week of which 2 h were supervised. At the beginning and end of the programme, anthropometric measurements, PWV and serum levels of OPG, TRAIL and hsCRP were measured. Results A total of 21 patients (17 men) aged 55.2 +/- 10 years completed the programme. Mean body mass index decreased from 34.1 +/- 5.8 to 32.6 +/- 5.4 kg/m2 (P < 0.05), while waist circumference decreased from 111.8 +/- 12.4 to 109.6 +/- 12.8 cm (P < 0.05). PWV decreased from 9.2 to 8.5 m/s (P < 0.02). OPG, TRAIL and hsCRP levels did not change significantly. Conclusions Exercise training reduced PWV but not OPG, TRAIL or hsCRP in this population. These data suggest that while an intervention of this nature improves vascular tone, it does not exert significant effects on serum biomarkers related to atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification.

Given the complex functional interdependencies between cellular components, a disease is seldom the consequence of a defect in a single gene product, instead reflecting the perturbations of a group of closely related gene products that carry out specific functions together. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore how the community of protein complexes impacts disease associations. Here, by integrating a large amount of information from protein complexes and the cellular basis of diseases, we built a human disease network in which two diseases are linked if they share common disease-related protein complex. A systemic analysis revealed that linked disease pairs exhibit higher comorbidity than those that have no links, and that the stronger association two diseases have based on protein complexes, the higher comorbidity they are prone to display. Moreover, more connected diseases tend to be malignant, which have high prevalence. We provide novel disease associations that cannot be identified through previous analysis. These findings will potentially provide biologists and clinicians new insights into the etiology, classification and treatment of diseases.

One such hypothesis is that intraspecific hybridization can facilitate invasions because hybrids express higher phenotypic mean and/or variance than their parents. We tested this hypothesis using the parasitoid wasp Psyttalia lounsburyi, a candidate biocontrol agent for the olive fly Bactrocera oleae. Under laboratory conditions, we found marked differentiations between two populations of wasps, from South Africa and Kenya, in terms of life history strategies. South African females were better reproducers than Kenyan females, but the opposite was observed for males. Reaction norms showed different effects of developmental temperature on fecundity depending on the genotype. However, neither heterosis nor hybrid breakdown were observed. Hence, in this system, sex-specific effects of hybridization and genotype-by-environment interactions jeopardize any straightforward prediction on the fitness of hybrids. Therefore, our paper contributes to tone down the hybrid advantage hypothesis in invasion biology.

Using this method, the specific amino acid turnover rates between proteins and the pool of free amino acids were determined for eight different amino acids (alanine, valine, proline, aspartic acid, glycine, leucine, isoleucine, and threonine) in two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (CEN.PK 113-7D and YSBN2). Furthermore, proteasome activities were compared for both strains. Both results confirmed the hypothesis of a higher protein turnover rates in CEN.PK 113-7D, which was generated in a previous comparative systems biology study of these two yeast strains. The ATP costs associated with the observed differences in protein turnover were quantified and could explain accurately the differences in biomass yield between both strains that are observed in chemostat cultures. The percentage of maintenance ATP associated with protein polymerization (polymerization for growth and re-polymerization because of turnover) and degradation was estimated to be 72% for YSBN2 and 79% for CEN.PK 113-7D, which makes these processes the dominant nonbiosynthetic drain of ATP in living cells, and hence, it represents an energetic parameter of great relevance.

Clinico-pathologic variables were compared for all surgically staged patients (2000-2008) with grade 3 endometrioid, papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma of the uterus based on tamoxifen exposure [Tam (+) vs. Tam (-)]. Overall survival was analyzed using a multivariable Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier estimates. Protein expression of ER alpha, PR, mTOR, p-mTOR, IGF-1R, EGFR, VEGF and HER-2/neu was compared by immunohistochemistry using a semiquantitative scoring system.Results. Of 115 patients with high grade endometrial cancers, 15 received tamoxifen. These patients were older at diagnosis than Tam (-) patients. A higher percentage of Tam (+) patients had carcinosarcoma compared to Tam (-) patients (60% vs. 30%, P=0.038). Overall survival for Tam (+) patients was shorter than Tam (-) patients (16.6 vs. 32.2 months, P=0.004). The hazard ratio for death for Tam (+) patients was 2.53 (P=0.014), controlling for age and stage. Intensity and extent of staining were similar for ER alpha, PR, VEGF, EGFR, p-mTOR and HER-2/neu. The average expression score for ICF-1R and mTOR in the Tam (+) group was significantly higher than the Tam (-) group: 10.3 vs 7.0, P=0.001 and 6.0 vs 3.1, P=0.029, respectively.Conclusion. There are differences in the biology of type II endometrial cancers that develop in women with prior tamoxifen exposure.

A Wolbachia strain (wInn) naturally infecting Drosophila innubila induces male killing, while native strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans usually induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In this study, we transferred wInn to D. melanogaster and D. simulans by embryonic microinjection, expecting conservation of the male-killing phenotype to the novel hosts, which are more suitable for genetic analysis. In contrast to our expectations, there was no effect on offspring sex ratio. Furthermore, no CI was observed in the transinfected flies. Overall, transinfected D. melanogaster lines displayed lower transmission rate and lower densities of Wolbachia than transinfected D. simulans lines, in which established infections were transmitted with near-perfect fidelity. In D. simulans, strain wInn had no effect on fecundity and egg-to-adult development. Surprisingly, one of the two transinfected lines tested showed increased longevity.

Crucial in managing the disease is not only lowering arterial blood pressure but also preventing or treating the typical end-organ damage caused by long-lasting and inadequately treated hypertension. In the past decade, it has been shown that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in several hypertension-related pathologies, such as cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, hypertensive heart failure, renal fibrosis, kidney failure, and, to a lesser extent, eye disease and hemorrhagic stroke. Whereas others extensively reviewed the role of miRs in atherosclerosis and vascular disease, this review focuses on their role in target organ damage during arterial hypertension. We emphasize the involvement of miRs in pathological end-organ remodeling processes and try to demonstrate some common miR signatures in distinct end organs. Hence, we aimed to provide proof of arterial hypertension being a systemic disease, similar to diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, miRs that act on one particular process in different end organs are interesting therapeutic targets.

Here we review and contextualize our contributions, which have emphasized the influence of structural changes and molecular flexibility. A repeated observation is the presence of conformational melding, in which the T-cell receptor (TCR), peptide, and in some cases, MHC protein cooperatively adjust in order for recognition to proceed. The structural changes reflect the intrinsic dynamics of the unligated proteins. Characterization of the dynamics of unligated TCR shows how binding loop motion can influence TCR cross-reactivity as well as specificity towards peptide and MHC. Examination of peptide dynamics indicates not only peptide-specific variation but also a peptide dependence to MHC flexibility. This latter point emphasizes that the TCR engages a composite peptide/MHC surface and that physically the receptor makes little distinction between the peptide and MHC. Much additional evidence for this can be found within the database of available structures, including our observations of a peptide dependence to the TCR binding mode and structural compensations for altered interatomic interactions, in which lost TCR-peptide interactions are replaced with TCR-MHC interactions. The lack of a hard-coded physical distinction between peptide and MHC has implications not only for specificity and cross-reactivity but also the mechanisms underlying MHC restriction as well as attempts to modulate and control TCR recognition.

Even with the remarkable progress in the structural biology of ?c receptors and their cytokines or interleukins, there are valuable lessons to be learned from the structural and biophysical studies of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and its a-receptor (IL-7Ra) and comparisons with other ?c family members. The structure of the IL-7/IL-7Ra complex teaches that interfaces between the ?c interleukins and their receptors can vary in size, polarity, and specificity, and that significant conformational changes might be necessary for complexes of interleukins and their receptors to bind the shared, activating ?c receptor. Binding, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies of IL-7 and IL-7Ra show that glycosylation and electrostatics can be important to interactions between interleukins and their receptor, even where the glycans and charged residues are distant from the interface. The structure of the IL-7Ra homodimer is a reminder that often-ignored non-activating complexes likely perform roles just as important to signaling as activating complexes.

Despite the ease with which electronic documents would permit the incorporation of this information into citation-based document search and retrieval systems, the possibilities of repeated citations remain untapped. Part of this under-utilization may be due to the fact that very little is known regarding the pattern of repeated citations in scholarly literature or how this pattern may vary as a function of journal, academic discipline or self-citation. The current research addresses these unanswered questions in order to facilitate the future incorporation of repeated citation information into document search and retrieval systems. Using data mining of electronic texts, the citation characteristics of nine different journals, covering the three different academic fields (economics, computing, and medicine & biology), were characterized. It was found that the frequency (f) with which a reference is cited Nor more times within a document is consistent across the sampled journals and academic fields. Self-citation causes an increase in frequency, and this effect becomes more pronounced for large N.

The goal of this workshop was to foster an ongoing discussion by the community on how to effectively train students from the biological, physical, engineering, and mathematical sciences to work at the intersection of these fields. One major point of discussion centered on how to be a successful interdisciplinary researcher in terms of where to publish, how to successfully write grants, and how to navigate evaluations for tenure and promotion. An emphasis was placed on the importance of developing strong multidisciplinary collaborations and clearly defining one's career trajectory to the home discipline. Another focus of the discussion was on the training of students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary work and helping these junior researchers to launch their careers. The group emphasized the need for the development of publicly available resources for biologists to learn basic tools for mathematical modeling and for mathematicians and engineers to see how their fields may be applied to current topics in the life sciences.

In the present study, two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry were used to resolve and identify proteins from five tissues: skeletal muscle, liver, brain, heart, and gill. Of 864 protein features excised from 2D gels, 424 proteins were identified, corresponding to a 49% identification rate. For any given tissue, several protein features were identified as the same protein, resulting in a total of 254 nonredundant proteins. These nonredundant proteins were categorized into a total of 11 molecular functions, including catalytic activity, structural molecule, binding, and transport. In all tissues, catalytic activity and binding were the most highly represented molecular functions. Comparing across the tissues, proteome coverage was lowest in skeletal muscle, due to a combination of a low number of gel spots excised for analysis and a high redundancy of identifications among these spots. Nevertheless, the identification of a substantial number of proteins with high statistical confidence from other tissues suggests that F. grandis may serve as a model fish for future studies of environmental proteomics and ultimately help to elucidate proteomic responses of fish and other vertebrates to environmental stress.

To delineate the global metabolism of HNSCC, we report H-1 NMR-based metabolic profiling of HNSCC cells from five different patients that were derived from various sites of the upper aerodigestive tract, including the floor of mouth, tongue and larynx. Primary cultures of normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) from three different donors were used for comparison. H-1 NMR spectra of polar and non-polar extracts of cells were used to identify more than thirty-five metabolites. Principal component analysis performed on the NMR data revealed a clear classification of NHOK and HNSCC cells. HNSCC cells exhibited significantly altered levels of various metabolites that clearly revealed dysregulation in multiple metabolic events, including Warburg effect, oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, TCA cycle anaplerotic flux, glutaminolysis, hexosamine pathway, osmo-regulatory and anti-oxidant mechanism. In addition, significant alterations in the ratios of phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine, and elevated arachidonic acid observed in HNSCC cells reveal an altered membrane choline phospholipid metabolism (MCPM). Furthermore, significantly increased activity of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), particularly cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) observed in all the HNSCC cells confirm an altered MCPM. In summary, the metabolomic findings presented here can be useful to further elucidate the biological aspects that lead to HNSCC, and also provide a rational basis for monitoring molecular mechanisms in response to chemotherapy. Moreover, cPIA(2) may serve as a potential therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapy of HNSCC. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In a previous report (Del Prete et al., 2008) we showed that, after differentiation. DC exhibited increased number of condensed mitochondria and dynamic changes in their energy metabolism. A study is presented here showing that the DC differentiation process is characterized by increased expression level and activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, as well as by an increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Moreover, DC are equipped with more efficient antioxidant protection systems, over expressed most likely to detoxify increased ROS production, as a consequence of the much higher mitochondrial activity. Kinetic analysis of the three main mitochondrial biogenesis-associated genes revealed that the peak in PPAR gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1 alpha) gene expression was suddenly reached few hours after the onset of the differentiation. While PGC-1 alpha expression rapidly declines, the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-I) expression gradually increased. These findings demonstrate that an active mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during DC differentiation and further suggest that an early input by the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC-1 alpha is needed to trigger the subsequent activation of the downstream transcription factors, NRF-1 and TFAM in this process.

Such scientific strides highlight the potential of replacing or repairing damaged tissues in congenital abnormalities, diseases, or injuries, as well as constructing functional tissue or organs in vivo. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of differentiating into bone-forming cells, they constitute an appropriate cell source to repair damaged bone tissues. In addition, the immunoregulatory property of MSCs provides a foundation for their use in treating a variety of autoimmune diseases. However, the interaction between MSCs and immune cells in cell-based tissue regeneration is largely unknown. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of MSC-based tissue regeneration, emphasizing the role of the immune microenvironment in bone regeneration. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There is, however, a dearth of such inducible systems in Myxococcus xanthus, a well-studied prokaryotic model for multicellular development, cell differentiation, motility, and light response and a promising source of secondary metabolites. The few available systems have limitations, and exogenously based ones are unavailable. Here, we describe two new, versatile inducible systems for conditional expression of genes in M. xanthus. One employs isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as an inducer and is inspired by those successfully applied in some other bacteria. The other requires vanillate as an inducer and is based on the system developed originally for Caulobacter crescentus and recently adapted for mammalian cells. Both systems are robust, with essentially no expression in the absence of an inducer. Depending on the inducer and the amounts added, expression levels can be modulated such that either system can conditionally express genes, including ones that are essential and are required at high levels such as ftsZ. The two systems operate during vegetative growth as well as during M. xanthus development. Moreover, they can be used to simultaneously induce expression of distinct genes within the same cell. The conditional expression systems we describe substantially expand the genetic tool kit available for studying M. xanthus gene function and cellular biology.

This three-credit hour course was focused on laboratory skills and was designed to reinforce and develop the students' laboratory techniques and problem-solving skills, as well as to give encouragement to participate in a summer research project. This skills course consisted of a lecture section with team-based laboratory rotations of five-weeks each. Most students in the rotations had the opportunity to work in both biology and chemistry laboratories. The skills course culminated in several students being chosen to continue research in the summer with a research stipend while under the direction of one of the faculty mentors. The summer research projects were all collaborative efforts between chemists and biologists. Data are provided from voluntary entrance and exit student surveys to determine students' overall skill levels and interests before and after completion of the skills course. This course was valuable in encouraging students to become involved in and committed to research, for teaching them laboratory techniques, and for helping them evolve into independent researchers.

During terminal differentiation of the epidermal keratinocytes, the nucleus undergoes a programmed transformation from active status, associated with execution of the genetic programs of cornification and epidermal barrier formation, to a fully inactive condition and becomes a part of the keratinized cells of the cornified layer. Tremendous progress achieved within the past two decades in understanding the biology of the nucleus and epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression allowed defining several levels in the regulation of cell differentiation-associated gene expression programs, including an accessibility of the gene regulatory regions to DNA-protein interactions, covalent DNA and histone modifications, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as higher-order chromatin remodeling and nuclear compartmentalization of the genes and transcription machinery. Here, we integrate our current knowledge of the mechanisms controlling gene expression during terminal keratinocyte differentiation with distinct levels of chromatin organization and remodeling. We also propose directions to further explore the role of epigenetic mechanisms and their interactions with other regulatory systems in the control of keratinocyte differentiation in normal and diseased skin.

Like for many somatic tissues, isolation of a nearly pure population of stem cells is a primary goal in cutaneous biology. We used a quantitative transplantation assay, using injection of keratinocytes into subcutis combined with limiting dilution analysis, to assess the long-term repopulating ability of putative murine EpiSC populations. Putative EpiSC populations were isolated by FACS sorting. The CD133(+) population and the subpopulation of CD133(+) cells that exhibits high mitochondrial membrane potential (D Psi m(hi)) were enriched for long-term repopulating EpiSCs versus unfractionated cells (3.9- and 5.2-fold, respectively). Evidence for self-renewal capacity was obtained by serial transplantation of long-term epidermal repopulating units derived from CD133(+) and CD133(+) Delta Psi m(hi) keratinocytes. CD133(+) keratinocytes were multipotent and produced significantly more hair follicles than CD133(-) cells. CD133(+) cells were a subset of the previously described integrin alpha 6(+)CD34(+) bulge cell population, and 28.9 +/- 8.6% were label-retaining cells. Thus, murine keratinocytes within the CD133(+) and CD133(+) Delta Psi m(hi) populations contain EpiSCs that regenerate the epidermis for the long term, are self-renewing, multipotent, and label-retaining cells.

Evolutionary theories suggest that men's more violent nature derives in part from their historically greater need to compete over access to potential mates. The current research investigates this link between mating and male violence and provides rigorous experimental evidence that mating motives cause men to behave violently toward other men. In these studies, men and women were primed with a mating motive and then performed a noise-blast aggression task. Being primed with mating led men, but not women, to deliver more painful blasts of white noise to a same-sex partner (but not an opposite-sex partner). This effect was particularly pronounced among men with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation, for whom competition over access to new mates is an especially relevant concern. Findings also suggest that mating-induced male violence is motivated by a desire to assert one's dominance over other men: when men were given feedback that they had won a competition with their partner (and thus had achieved dominance through nonaggressive means), the effect of the mating prime on aggression was eliminated. These findings provide insight into the motivational roots of male aggression and illustrate the value of testing theories from evolutionary biology with rigorous experimental methods.

The image charges are obtained either by a least square fitting between the potential of unknown images and the exact reaction potential (for the layered media or cylindrical region) or by a Prony fitting to the Fourier transform of the exact potential (layered media only) and a Sommerfeld-type identity, which yields the locations and strengths of the image charges. Next, combining the results for the two geometries, the image charge approximation for the reaction potential, due to a charge inside an ion-channel model, is obtained, which accounts for the polarization of the region outside the ion-channel (consisting of a membrane and electrolyte solutions below and above). Such an approximation to the reaction field in the ion-channel model can be used for an explicit/implicit hybrid treatment of electrostatics interaction in modeling ion-channels. Numerical tests show that the proposed method has an attractive performance in computing electrostatic interactions of source charges inside the ion-channel model via a simple summation of pairwise interactions among source and image charges.

Rocky Mountain Biological Stations in the Early Twentieth Century,"Abstract: Biological field stations proliferated in the Rocky Mountains region of the western United States during the early decades of the twentieth century. This essay examines these Rocky Mountain field stations as hybrid lab-field sites from the perspective of the field side of the dichotomy: as field sites with raised walls rather than as laboratories whose walls with the natural world have been lowered. Not only were these field stations transformed to be more like laboratories, but they were also embedded within the particular regional environmental and institutional context of the Rocky Mountains. Using the University of Colorado's Mountain Laboratory at Tolland and other contemporaneous sites as examples, this essay analyzes key features of these sites, including their location within transportation networks, buildings, equipment, personnel, scheduling, recreational and social activities, and other material and social practices on the ground. Considering both the distinctive and shared characteristics of the Rocky Mountain field stations in comparison to other types of field stations provides a more complete picture of the diversity and range of lab-field hybrid sites in the biological sciences in the early twentieth-century United States.

Hastings became a center for field biology on the West Coast, and by 1960 it was serving as a model for the creation of additional U.C. reserves. Today, the U.C. Natural Reserve System (NRS) is the largest and most diverse network of university-based biological field stations in the world, with 36 sites covering more than 135,000 acres. This essay examines the founding of the Hastings Reservation, and asks how it managed to grow and develop, in the 1940s and 1950s, during a time of declining support for natural history research. It shows how faculty and staff courted the support of key institutional allies, presented themselves as the guardians of a venerable tradition in nature study, and emphasized the station's capacity to document ecological change and inform environmental policy and management. In the years since, Hastings and other U.C. reserves have played crucial roles in California environmental politics. Biological field stations in the post-war era deserve more attention not only from historians of biology, but also from environmental historians and other scholars interested in the role of science in society.

Recent reports of long-term prostate cancer outcomes stratified by Gleason score based on the 2005 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) update suggest that important aspects of the biology of prostate cancer correlate with commonly available histopathological information. In this review we present a conceptual framework for the possible existence of distinct but interrelated developmental pathways in the context of the Gleason score in considering various biological and clinical aspects of prostate cancer. This may be useful in characterizing prostate cancer as an indolent condition in some and an aggressive disease in others, in decision making for treatment, and in the interpretation of the biological course and treatment outcomes.Materials and Methods: A comprehensive review of clinical, pathological and investigational biological literature on this topic was conducted. In addition, the biological behavior of prostate cancer as interpreted from this survey was compared to that of other solid neoplasms in developing a schema for characterizing the pathogenesis of various forms of the disease.Results: The Gleason scoring system has been found to have fundamental value in predicting the behavior of prostate cancer and assessing outcomes of its treatment. Increasingly, the proportion of Gleason pattern 4 in a prostatectomy specimen is being recognized as a critical factor in predicting the rates of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality. Under the current Gleason classification, a Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 cancer carries a minimal long-term risk of progression or mortality. Risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality increases with increasing proportions of the Gleason 4 component in the prostatectomy specimen, from 3 + 3 = 6 with tertiary 4 (ie less than 5% of a 4 component) to 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 3 = 7 and 4 + 4 = 8. Assuming that the Gleason 4 component increases in volume more rapidly with time than well differentiated components, it can be inferred that a smaller proportion of Gleason 4 could mean that the cancer has been identified at an earlier phase in the natural history of the disease. This could explain the improved prognosis on the basis of length and lead time biases, and conceivably on the basis of a decreased likelihood of cancer cells having metastasized. Correspondingly, increasing amounts of Gleason 4 cancer in a prostate specimen might be explained in 2 ways, as the preferential growth of a single clone of Gleason 4 cells, possibly with intraprostatic spread, or the evolution of Gleason 3 cancer cells to become Gleason 4. These hypotheses have been examined by genetic analysis of metastatic deposits and by comparisons of multiple foci of cancer within individual prostates. The clinical significance of these concepts in regard to disease status at diagnosis, treatment selection, outcomes of treatment, and implications for future research on the basis of clinical and molecular observations are the basis of the developmental schemata we propose.Conclusions: Given the relatively benign nature of homogeneous, low volume Gleason 3 tumors, and the progressive risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality with increasing quantities of Gleason 4 components, we propose that Gleason 4 (and 5) cancers constitute cancer diatheses distinct from that of Gleason 3 cancer. This distinction may contribute to the understanding of the prognosis intrinsic to these biological behavioral patterns, and help guide the translation of findings at molecular and histological levels to a more precise selection of treatments.

However, dynamic tracer imaging can provide considerably more information about in vivo biology by delineating both the temporal and spatial pattern of tracer uptake. In addition, several potential sources of error that occur in static imaging can be mitigated. This review focuses on the application of dynamic PET imaging to measuring regional cancer biologic features and especially in using dynamic PET imaging for quantitative therapeutic response monitoring for cancer clinical trials. Dynamic PET imaging output parameters, particularly transport (flow) and overall metabolic rate, have provided imaging end points for clinical trials at single-center institutions for years. However, dynamic imaging poses many challenges for multicenter clinical trial implementations from cross-center calibration to the inadequacy of a common informatics infrastructure. Underlying principles and methodology of PET dynamic imaging are first reviewed, followed by an examination of current approaches to dynamic PET image analysis with a specific case example of dynamic fluorothymidine imaging to illustrate the approach.

These are so highly diverse in sequence and distribution, they are essentially considered as species-specific. However, we have recently shown the presence of homologous effectors in fungal species of the Dothideomycetes class. One such example is Ecp2, an effector originally described in the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum but later detected in the plant pathogenic fungi Mycosphaerella fijiensis and Mycosphaerella graminicola as well. Here, using in silico sequence-similarity searches against a database of 135 fungal genomes and GenBank, we extend our queries for homologs of Ecp2 to the fungal kingdom and beyond, and further study their history of diversification. Our analyses show that Ecp2 homologs are members of an ancient and widely distributed superfamily of putative fungal effectors, which we term Hce2 for Homologs of C. fulvum Ecp2. Molecular evolutionary analyses show that the superfamily originated and diversified within the fungal kingdom, experiencing multiple lineage-specific expansions and losses that are consistent with the birth-and-death model of gene family evolution. Newly formed paralogs appear to be subject to diversification early after gene duplication events, whereas at later stages purifying selection acts to preserve diversity and the newly evolved putative functions. Some members of the Hce2 superfamily are fused to fungal Glycoside Hydrolase family 18 chitinases that show high similarity to the Zymocin killer toxin from the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, suggesting an analogous role in antagonistic interactions. The observed high rates of gene duplication and loss in the Hce2 superfamily, combined with diversification in both sequence and possibly functions within and between species, suggest that Hce2s are involved in adaptation to stresses and new ecological niches. Such findings address the need to rationalize effector biology and evolution beyond the perspective of solely host-microbe interactions.

In previous work we identified the glucosyltransferase UgtP as a division inhibitor responsible for increasing the size of Bacillus subtilis cells under nutrient-rich conditions. In nutrient-rich medium, UgtP is distributed more or less uniformly throughout the cytoplasm and concentrated at the cell poles and/or the cytokinetic ring. Under these conditions, UgtP interacts directly with FtsZ to inhibit division and increase cell size. Conversely, under nutrient-poor conditions, UgtP is sequestered away from FtsZ in punctate foci, and division proceeds unimpeded resulting in a reduction in average cell size. Here we report that nutrient-dependent changes in UgtP's oligomerization potential serve as a molecular rheostat to precisely co-ordinate B.?subtilis cell size with nutrient availability. Our data indicate UgtP interacts with itself and the essential cell division protein FtsZ in a high-affinity manner influenced in part by UDP glucose, an intracellular proxy for nutrient availability. These findings support a model in which UDP-glc-dependent changes in UgtP's oligomerization potential shift the equilibrium between UgtP center dot UgtP and UgtP center dot FtsZ, fine-tuning the amount of FtsZ available for assembly into the cytokinetic ring and with it cell size.

For example, the detection of reliable phenotypegenotype associations and molecular signatures of selection requires a detailed knowledge about genome-wide patterns of allele frequency variation, linkage disequilibrium and recombination. We resequenced 16 genomes of the model tree Populus trichocarpa and genotyped 120 trees from 10 subpopulations using 29 213 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Significant geographic differentiation was present at multiple spatial scales, and range-wide latitudinal allele frequency gradients were strikingly common across the genome. The decay of linkage disequilibrium with physical distance was slower than expected from previous studies in Populus, with r(2) dropping below 0.2 within 36 kb. Consistent with this, estimates of recent effective population size from linkage disequilibrium (N-e approximate to 4000-6000) were remarkably low relative to the large census sizes of P. trichocarpa stands. Fine-scale rates of recombination varied widely across the genome, but were largely predictable on the basis of DNA sequence and methylation features. Our results suggest that genetic drift has played a significant role in the recent evolutionary history of P. trichocarpa. Most importantly, the extensive linkage disequilibrium detected suggests that genome-wide association studies and genomic selection in undomesticated populations may be more feasible in Populus than previously assumed.

Despite this, little is known about the detailed ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation due to the scarce number of controlled experimental surveys. The speciesarea relationship, a fundamental concept in ecology, requires the understanding of the fragmentation effects in a long term perspective, which turns this task even harder. Here we address the spatial patterns of species distribution in fragmented landscapes, assuming a neutral community model. We study the species area relationship and how its shape changes as the landscape becomes more fragmented. Recent investigations, based on extensive computer simulation, have contributed to establish some definite conclusions in the study of non-fragmented landscapes: the existence of a three-regime or two-regime scenario for the speciesarea relationship, the emergence of a power-law regime at intermediate scales and the augment of the speciesarea exponent z with the speciation rate. Despite the recent efforts, some other questions remain, such as the dependence of z in the whole range of the speciation rate. Questions like these are currently debated but generalizations cannot be drawn. This is the first paper, to our knowledge, that uses the coalescence method and neutral theory to examine biodiversity on more complex spatial structures. Our simulation results corroborate that the fragmentation plays a crucial role in shaping the speciesarea relationship, by determining the existence and extension of the power-law regime associated with small and intermediate areas. On the other hand, when individuals are allowed to disperse over longer distances the speciesarea relationship now displays the classic triphasic pattern, and the intermediate regime, which is well described by a power-law, is established even for highly fragmented landscapes.

Early diagnosis remains a significant problem in the clinical treatment of OS as we remain far from a comprehensive understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms and the biology involved. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), a large family of small non-coding RNAs, may provide a greater understanding of OS as they play a complex role in gene expression regulation in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, the differential expression profiles of miRNAs between OS and osteoblast cell lines were investigated by miRNA microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). A total of 268 miRNAs were identified that were significantly dysregulated in OS compared with the osteoblast cell line, including miR-9, miR-99, miR-195, miR-148a and miR-181a, which had been validated as overexpressed, and miR-143, miR-145, miR-335 and miR-539, which were confirmed to be downregulated. This differential expression may aid future OS diagnosis and prognosis prediction and illustration of the potential mechanisms in the oncogenesis, development and metastasis of OS. Bioinformatic research on these differentially expressed miRNAs suggests that they are able to regulate the biological behaviors of OS in a complex and effective manner. Further study on the function. of these miRNAs is likely to provide new insights into OS biology and treatment.

In squash fruit and other high water content crops, the grinding of tissue with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen fails to produce a homogeneous and fine powered sample desirable to ensure a good penetration of the extraction reagent. Objective To develop an improved pulverisation method to facilitate the homogenisation process of squash fruit tissue prior to RNA extraction without reducing quality and yield of the extracted RNA. Methodology Three methods of pulverisation, each followed by the same extraction protocol, were compared. The first approach consisted of the lyophilisation of the sample in order to remove the excess of water before grinding, the second one used a cryogenic mill and the control one a mortar grinding of frozen tissue. The quality of the isolated RNA was tested by carrying out a quantitative real time downstream amplification. Results In the three situations considered, mean values for A(260)/A(280) indicated minimal interference by proteins and RNA quality indicator (RQI) values were considered appropriate for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) amplification. Successful qRT-PCR amplifications were obtained with cDNA isolated with the three protocols. Conclusion Both apparatus can improve and facilitate the grinding step in the RNA extraction process in zucchini, resulting in isolated RNA of high quality and integrity as revealed by qRT-PCR downstream application. This is apparently the first time that a cryogenic mill has been used to prepare fruit samples for RNA extraction, thereby improving the sampling strategy because the fine powder obtained represents a homogeneous mix of the organ tissue.

The same tight regulation applies to essential organelles that can both sustain cell survival or promote self-degradation programs. Mitochondria are perhaps the prime example of cellular machineries with split functions (personalities). As a main source of ATP, mitochondria represent the main powerhouse of eukaryotic cells. However, mitochondrial respiration has the hidden complication of the production of potentially harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, mitochondria holds an armamentarium of stress-response factors, which depending on the context, may lead to pro-inflammatory signals, and to various forms of cell death, ranging from apoptosis to necrosis. A main clearance mechanism to eliminate superfluous, damaged or hyperactive mitochondria is selective mitophagy. Mitophagy, in fact, is emerging as a key quality-control mechanism in cancer cells. Specifically, malignant transformation has been found to induce marked changes in mitochondrial dynamics and structure. Moreover, a key hallmark of tumor progression is metabolic reprogramming, which further deregulates ROS content and renders cells more susceptible to mitochondrial perturbations. Despite its increasing relevance in cancer biology, the field of mitophagy remains virtually unexplored in melanoma. However, given unique antioxidant mechanisms in melanocytic cells (e.g., linked to melanin) and the idiosyncratic interplay between ROS and hypoxia (both mitophagy inducers) in melanoma, this tumor type represents an ideal scenario for physiological studies of mitochondrial turnover. This perspective summarizes proof of concept for in-depth basic and translational studies of mitophagy in melanoma. Particular emphasis is dedicated to new opportunities for gene discovery and drug design in this still aggressive disease.

We summarize recent findings on the function and rewiring of central carbon metabolism in melanoma. Metabolic profiling studies using stable isotope tracers show that glycolysis is decoupled from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This decoupling is not dysfunction but rather an alternate wiring required by tumor cells to remain metabolically versatile. In large part, this requirement is met by glutamine feeding the TCA cycle as an alternative source of carbon. Glutamine is also used in non-conventional ways, like traveling in reverse through the TCA flux to feed fatty acid biosynthesis. Biosynthetic networks linked with non-essential amino acids alanine, serine, arginine, and proline are also significantly impacted by the use of glutamine as an alternate carbon source.

However, there are difficulties in obtaining cell lines from adult human intestine, such as microbial contamination of cultures from the tissue samples, short life span of enterocytes, overgrowth of mesenchymal cells, etc. Various model used to obtain adult intestinal cell lines are very complex requiring use of feeder layer or gel matrices. The aim of this study was to establish a novel method for the simple and reproducible isolation of human enterocytes. Enterocytes were isolated from SI samples (n = 5) obtained from cadaveric donors using a mechanical procedure, and separation with immunomagnetic beads coated with anti-EpCAM antibodies. Light and electron microscopy, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry techniques were used to characterize the isolated cells. Immunohistochemical staining of normal SB biopsies confirmed that the cell cultures maintained an in vivo phenotype as reflected in cytokeratin expression CK18, CK20 and expression of intestine-specific markers such as sucrase isomaltase and maltase glucoamylase. Furthermore, the cells strongly expressed TLR-5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 and several molecules such as CD40, CD86, CD44, ICAM-1 and HLA-DR which are important in triggering cell-mediated immune responses.

Despite this, consensus with respect to the definition, causes or solutions is lacking, making obesity a prominent knowledge controversy. In this article, I argue that the Barker hypothesis, a theory of foetal development, can support the redistribution of expertise necessary to address this knowledge controversy. A vast scientific literature confirms its argument that many diseases can be traced to the conditions for development in utero determined by the commingling of temporally and spatially complex processes. The Barker hypothesis does not support solely reductionist, biophysiological paradigms of health and disease, but rather evinces complex understandings that span biology, social positionality, place and generation. I argue that this makes the hypothesis significant for transdisciplinary studies of health and disease, and prompts consideration beyond the conventional bounds of epidemiology to new sites of understanding and action that may support movements concerned with body politics and justice for fat people. I point to literature on the potential for injustice engendered by the Barker hypothesis, and suggest that these critiques reveal the very necessity for transdisciplinary collaboration on obesity in the first place.

The search for a reliable marker to identify these CSCs is ongoing as current markers, like CD44 and CD133, are more broadly expressed and therefore are not highly selective and currently also lack function in CSC biology. Here, we analyzed whether the Wnt target Lgr5, which has earlier been identified as a marker for murine intestinal stem cells, could potentially serve as a functional marker for CSCs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based detection of Lgr5, using three newly developed antibodies, on primary colorectal tumor cells revealed a clear subpopulation of Epcam+Lgr5+ cells. Similarly, primary CRC-derived spheroid cultures, known to be enriched for CSCs, contain high levels of Lgr5+ cells, which decrease upon in vitro differentiation of these CSCs. Selection of the Lgr5high CRC cells identified the clonogenic fraction in vitro as well as the tumorigenic population in vivo. Finally, we confirm that Lgr5 expression is dependent on the Wnt pathway and show that Lgr5 overexpression induces clonogenic growth. We thus provide evidence that Lgr5 is, next to a functional intestinal stem cell marker, a selective marker for human colorectal CSCs.

The biochemical regulation of axon myelination via the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) has been characterized extensively. However, most biochemical analysis has been conducted in vitro on OPCs adhered to substrata of stiffness that is orders of magnitude greater than that of the in vivo CNS environment. Little is known of how variation in mechanical properties over the physiological range affects OPC biology. Here, we show that OPCs are mechanosensitive. Cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation capacity in vitro depend on the mechanical stiffness of polymer hydrogel substrata. Most of these properties are optimal at the intermediate values of CNS tissue stiffness. Moreover, many of these properties measured for cells on gels of optimal stiffness differed significantly from those measured on glass or polystyrene. The dependence of OPC differentiation on the mechanical properties of the extracellular environment provides motivation to revisit results obtained on nonphysiological, rigid surfaces. We also find that OPCs stiffen upon differentiation, but that they do not change their compliance in response to substratum stiffness, which is similar to embryonic stem cells, but different from adult stem cells. These results form the basis for further investigations into the mechanobiology of cell function in the CNS and may specifically shed new light on the failure of remyelination in chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Based on the facts that (i) mammary stem/progenitor cells (MaSC) are proposed to be the driving forces behind mammary growth and function and (ii) variation exists between mammalian species with regard to physiological and pathological functioning of this organ, we believe that studying MaSC from different mammals is of great comparative interest. Over the years, important data has been gathered on MaSC of men and mice, although knowledge on MaSC in other mammals remains limited. Therefore, the aim of this work was to isolate and characterize MaSC from the mammary gland of horses. Hereby, our salient findings were that the isolated equine cells met the 2 in vitro hallmark properties of stem cells, namely the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. Moreover, the cells were immunophenotyped using markers for CD29, CD44, CD49f, and Ki67. Finally, we propose the mammosphere assay as a valuable in vitro assay to study MaSC during different physiological phases since it was observed that equine lactating mammary gland contains significantly more mammosphere-initiating cells than the inactive, nonlactating gland (a reflection of MaSC self-renewal) and, moreover, that these spheres were significantly larger in size upon initial cultivation (a reflection of progenitor cell proliferation). Taken together, this study not only extends the current knowledge of mammary gland biology, but also benefits the comparative approach to study and compare MaSC in different mammalian species.

There is currently no available treatment for disease caused by these toxin-producing bacteria, and understanding the biology of the Shiga toxins might be instrumental in addressing this issue. In target cells, the toxins efficiently inhibit protein synthesis by inactivating ribosomes, and they may induce signaling leading to apoptosis. To reach their cytoplasmic target, Shiga toxins are endocytosed and transported by a retrograde pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum, before the enzymatically active moiety is translocated to the cytosol. The toxins thereby serve as powerful tools to investigate mechanisms of intracellular transport. Although Shiga toxins are a serious threat to human health, the toxins may be exploited for medical purposes such as cancer therapy or imaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PTM at multiple sites on a protein creates a combinatorial explosion in the number of potential mod-forms, or global patterns of modification. Distinct mod-forms can elicit distinct downstream responses, so that the overall response depends partly on the effectiveness of a particular mod-form to elicit a response and partly on the stoichiometry of that mod-form in the molecular population. We introduce the mod-form distributionthe relative stoichiometries of each mod-formas the most informative measure of a protein's state. Distinct mod-form distributions may summarize information about distinct cellular and physiological conditions and allow downstream processes to interpret this information accordingly. Such information encoding by PTMs may facilitate evolution by weakening the need to directly link upstream conditions to downstream responses. Mod-form distributions provide a quantitative framework in which to interpret ideas of PTM codes that are emerging in several areas of biology, as we show by reviewing examples of ion channels, GPCRs, microtubules, and transcriptional co-regulators. We focus particularly on examples other than the well-known histone code, to emphasize the pervasive use of information encoding in molecular biology.

The ability to visualize matter at these scales in a TEM is largely due to the efforts made in correcting for the imperfections in the lens systems which introduce aberrations and ultimately limit the achievable spatial resolution. In addition to the progress made in increasing the spatial resolution, the TEM has become an all-in-one characterization tool. Indeed, most of the properties of a material can be directly mapped in the TEM, including the composition, structure, bonding, morphology, and defects. The scope of applications spans essentially all of the physical sciences and includes biology.Until recently, however, high resolution visualization of structural changes occurring on sub-millisecond time scales was not possible. In order to reach the ultrashort temporal domain within which fundamental atomic motions take place, while simultaneously retaining high spatial resolution, an entirely new approach from that of millisecond-limited TEM cameras had to be conceived. As shown below, the approach is also different from that of nanosecond-limited TEM, whose resolution cannot offer the ultrafast regimes of dynamics. For this reason ""ultrafast electron microscopy"" is reserved for the field which is concerned with femtosecond to picosecond resolution capability of structural dynamics.In conventional TEMs, electrons are produced by heating a source or by applying a strong extraction field. Both methods result In the stochastic emission of electrons, with no control over temporal spacing or relative arrival time at the specimen. The timing issue can be overcome by exploiting the photoelectric effect and using pulsed lasers to generate precisely timed electron packets of ultrashort duration. The spatial and temporal resolutions achievable with short intense pulses containing a large number of electrons, however, are limited to tens of nanometers and nanoseconds, respectively. This is because Coulomb repulsion is significant in such a pulse, and the electrons spread in space and time, thus limiting the beam coherence. It Is therefore not possible to image the ultrafast elementary dynamics of complex transformations. The challenge was to retain the high spatial resolution of a conventional TEM while simultaneously enabling the temporal resolution required to visualize atomic-scale motions.In this Account, we discuss the development of four-dimensional ultrafast electron microscopy (4D UEM) and summarize techniques and applications that illustrate the power of the approach. In UEM, images are obtained either stroboscopically with coherent single-electron packets or with a single electron bunch. Coulomb repulsion is absent under the single-electron condition, thus permitting imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy, all with high spatiotemporal resolution, the atomic scale (sub-nanometer and femtosecond). The time resolution is limited only by the laser pulse duration and energy carried by the electron packets; the CCD camera has no bearing on the temporal resolution. In the regime of single pulses of electrons, the temporal resolution of picoseconds can be attained when hundreds of electrons are in the bunch.The applications given here are selected to highlight phenomena of different length and time scales, from atomic motions during structural dynamics to phase transitions and nanomechanical oscillations. We conclude with a brief discussion of emerging methods, which include scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (S-UEM), scanning transmission ultrafast electron microscopy (ST-UEM) with convergent beams, and time-resolved imaging of biological structures at ambient conditions with environmental cells.

Several objective approaches were used to explore patterns in the data and to find genes associated with changes in disease activity due to treatment.Results This analysis revealed two patient populations associated with distinct clinical, laboratory and histological features and, importantly, showed enrichment for response (60% non-responders vs 90% responders). A composite baseline gene score (GS) correlated with change in disease activity score (Delta DAS) between baseline and month 3 (r=0.74, p=0.0002), but also with Delta DAS at later time-points (month 9, r=0.54, p=0.016; month 15, r=0.45, p=0.06; month 21, r=0.72, p=0.003). Notably, the GS significantly correlated with baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.69, p=0.0008), but not with other DAS components. The GS genes represented T cell, macrophage, remodelling and interferon-a biology. Responders demonstrated higher expression of macrophage and T cell genes, while non-responders showed higher expression of interferon-alpha and remodelling genes.Conclusions This study reveals a baseline synovial GS that correlates with early and late clinical responses to rituximab.

The mutants were also combined with overexpression of PGM2, earlier proved as a beneficial target for galactose utilization. The constructed strains were analyzed for their gross phenotype, transcriptome and targeted metabolites, and the results were compared to those obtained from reference strains and the evolved strains. The RAS2(Lys77) mutation resulted in the highest specific galactose uptake rate among all of the strains with an increased maximum specific growth rate on galactose. The RAS2(Tyr112) mutation also improved the specific galactose uptake rate and also resulted in many transcriptional changes, including ergosterol metabolism. The ERG5(Pro370) mutation only showed a small improvement, but when it was combined with PGM2 overexpression, the phenotype was almost the same as that of the evolved mutants. Combination of the RAS2 mutations with PGM2 overexpression also led to a complete recovery of the adaptive phenotype in galactose utilization.

It is widely believed that environmental degradation of streams and rivers may facilitate susceptibility to invasion; however, this has not yet been demonstrated consistently across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We analyzed macroinvertebrate data from 398 stream and river sites in Germany in order to test whether morphologically and physicochemically degraded stream and river habitats are more prone to invasion. Further, we identified the most important environmental variables facilitating invasion. The study confirmed that invaded sites were significantly more degraded than sites where only indigenous species were recorded. In both streams and rivers, invaded sites featured increased maximum temperatures, chloride and total organic carbon concentrations and a decreased morphological habitat quality. In streams, additionally the variables minimum temperature, oxygen, orthophosphate and ammonium contributed to greater degradation. In rivers also nitrate concentration was increased at invaded sites. Generalized linear models indicated that chloride was one of the most important variables that favored invasibility in both streams and rivers. In streams, the most indicative variables for invasion risk also included orthophosphate and maximum temperature. In rivers, in addition to chloride, morphological habitat quality was important.

Further, we investigated which locations are vulnerable to future establishment using geospatial data (1,075 native and 124 invasive records) in a Maxent model developed with data from the Worldclim database. We found introductions of X. laevis to be continuous over the last 50 years and invasions to be ongoing on four continents: Asia, Europe, North and South America. Invasion pathways were related to scientific use and the pet trade, with high rates of deliberate release followed by a lag of 2-25 years to first reports. No populations were found to be declining although some have been extirpated. Optimal uninvaded bioclimatic space was identified in central Mexico and southern Australia, while larger suitable areas were found in southern South America and southwestern Europe. Xenopus laevis is a cryptic invasive species that is likely to increase its invasive distribution, through new introductions and by the spread of ongoing invasions. Many more invasive populations are likely to exist than are currently recognised and reducing invasive potential will largely rely on education of those involved with their captive care.

This complexity can be seen in the number and diversity of genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and characteristics of the leukaemic stem cells. The broad range of abnormalities across different AML subtypes suggests that improvements in clinical outcome will require the development of targeted therapies for each subtype of disease and the design of novel clinical trials to test these strategies. It is highly unlikely that further gains in long-term survival rates will be possible by mere intensification of conventional chemotherapy. In this review, we summarize recent studies that provide new insight into the genetics and biology of AML, discuss risk stratification and therapy for this disease, and profile some of the therapeutic agents currently under investigation.

It is conspicuously different from classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and is now recognized as distinctive form of B cell lymphoma. Although it has an indolent clinical course, it has a propensity for multiple and often late relapses. Although the majority of children present with early stage disease and without B symptoms, treatment strategy has, until recently, been identical to that used for cHL. This approach is excessively toxic as it predisposes these children and adolescents to serious late effects including end organ damage to heart, gonads, lungs, thyroid and second malignant neoplasms. The aim of this article is to review the published literature on the treatment outcomes of nLPHL in affected children and adolescents, and discuss the options for treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted anti-CD 20 antibody therapy.

For a number of years, biophysically detailed mathematical models of cardiac electrical activity have been used to explore how a compound, interfering with specific ion-channel function, may explain effects at the cell-, tissue- and organ-scales. With the advent of high-throughput screening of multiple ion channels in the wet-lab, and improvements in computational modelling of their effects on cardiac cell activity, more reliable prediction of pro-arrhythmic risk is becoming possible at the earliest stages of drug development. In this paper, we review the current use of biophysically detailed mathematical models of cardiac myocyte electrical activity in drug safety testing, and suggest future directions to employ the full potential of this approach.

However, research over the last decade has shown that GPCRs exist in multiple conformations, and that agonists can stabilize different active states. The distinct receptor conformations induced by ligands result in distinct receptoreffector complexes, which produce varying levels of activation or inhibition of subsequent signalling cascades. This concept, referred to as ligand-directed signalling or biased agonism has important biological and therapeutic implications. Opioid receptors are Gi/o GPCRs and regulate a number of important physiological functions, including pain, reward, mood, stress, gastrointestinal transport and respiration. A number of in vitro studies have shown biased agonism at the three opioid receptors (mu, d and kappa); however, in vivo consequences of this phenomenon have only recently been demonstrated. For the mu and delta opioid receptors, the majority of reported ligand selective behavioural effects are observed as differential adaptations to repeated drug administration. In terms of the kappa opioid receptor, clear links between ligand-selective signalling events and specific in vivo responses have been recently characterized. Drugs for all three receptors are either already used or are being developed for clinical applications. There is clearly a need to better characterize the specific events that occur following agonist stimulation and how these relate to in vivo responses. This understanding could eventually lead to the development of tailor-made pharmacotherapies where advantageous drug effects can be selectively targeted over adverse effects.

We aimed to assess the effect of pharmacological modulation of beta 3-adrenoceptors on portal pressure (PP) and systemic haemodynamics and their expression in the liver and mesenteric vessels of cirrhotic rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH PP, central venous pressure (CVP) and systemic haemodynamics were invasively assessed in control and CCl4-treated cirrhotic rats before and during infusion of the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, SR58611A. Tissue samples were also collected from liver, heart, portal vein and mesenteric artery for immunohistochemistry and molecular biology analysis. The effect of SR58611A on isolated portal vein was assessed. KEY RESULTS At baseline, cirrhotic rats showed portal hypertension, reduced CVP and hyperdynamic circulation. SR58611A induced a significant, dose-dependent decrease in PP in cirrhotic rats, but not in controls. Although both groups manifested a dose-dependent reduction in mean arterial pressure, this effect was associated with decreased cardiac index (CI) and unchanged indicized peripheral vascular resistance (PVRI) in cirrhotic rats and increased CI and decreased PVRI in control animals. Pretreatment with the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230 prevented all SR58611A-induced changes in cirrhotic rats. SR58611A concentration-dependently relaxed portal vein in cirrhotic rats to a significantly greater extent than in healthy rats; pretreatment with SR59230A completely prevented SR58611A-induced cirrhotic portal vein relaxation. Finally, beta 3-adrenoceptors were identified in the liver, heart and portal vein of cirrhotic and control animals; their expression was increased in cirrhotic rats. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS beta 3-Adrenoceptors are altered in portal hypertension of experimental cirrhosis and may represent a novel therapeutic target.

Now we need to understand just how incompletely penetrant genes make their contributions to psychopathology. Exciting new developments in molecular genetics and epigenetics provide new insight into gene action in principle but have been of limited value so far in understanding the emergence of psychopathology. Some of the most helpful postulates might come from evolutionary and developmental biology and agricultural breeding experiments. I describe the all but forgotten evolutionary mechanisms articulated by Schmalhausen, a Russian evolutionary biologist whose work was suppressed by Stalin in the 1940s. I focus on Schmalhausen's law, the observation that organisms living in conditions at the boundary of their tolerance in any one aspect of existence will be vulnerable to expression of genetic liabilities related to all other aspects of existence. I show how Schmalhausen's ideas are relevant to the results of a century-long corn-breeding experiment and the current concepts of facilitated variation and cryptic genetic variation. I then discuss the relevance of all of these to understanding genetic influences on personality and psychopathology.

Although the impact of prenatal maternal distress has been well documented, the potential mechanisms through which maternal psychosocial variables shape development have yet to be fully elucidated. Advances in molecular biology have highlighted the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene activity, neurobiology, and behavior and the potential role of environmentally induced epigenetic variation in linking early life exposures to long-term biobehavioral outcomes. In this article, we discuss evidence illustrating the association between maternal prenatal distress and both fetal and infant developmental trajectories and the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating these effects. Postnatal experiences may have a critical moderating influence on prenatal effects, and we review findings illustrating prenatal-postnatal interplay and the developmental and epigenetic consequences of postnatal mother-infant interactions. The in utero environment is regulated by placental function and there is emerging evidence that the placenta is highly susceptible to maternal distress and a target of epigenetic dysregulation. Integrating studies of prenatal exposures, placental function, and postnatal maternal care with the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology induced by maternal distress.

This in turn has opened new areas of investigation that can potentially bridge the gap between neuroscience and psychopathology. For the first time we can study the cell biology and genetics of neurons derived from any individual. Furthermore, by recapitulating in vitro the developmental steps whereby stem cells give rise to neuronal cells, we can now hope to understand factors that control typical and atypical development. We can begin to explore how human genes and their variants are transcribed into messenger RNAs within developing neurons and how these gene transcripts control the biology of developing cells. Thus, human-induced pluripotent stem cells have the potential to uncover not only what aspects of development are uniquely human but also variations in the series of events necessary for normal human brain development that predispose to psychopathology.

We tested the hypotheses that intensification of land use will reduce dung beetles richness, abundance and biomass and, consequently, their dung burial ability, affecting the interaction between dung beetles and flies and reducing its effectiveness as a natural biological control. In the Brazilian Amazon we sampled dung beetles, fly larvae and adults; and recorded the rate of dung removal by dung beetles across a gradient of land-use intensity from primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture to pasture. Our results provide evidence that land-use intensification results in a reduction of the richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles, and this in turn results in lower rates of dung removal in the most simplified systems. We found no significant differences in the abundance of fly larvae between the different systems of land use. However, the number of adult flies differed significantly between land-use systems, presenting higher abundance in those sites with greater intensity of use (pasture and agriculture) and a lower abundance of adult flies in forested systems (primary and secondary forests, and agroforestry). Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of land-use systems, dung removal rates and dung beetle abundance, biomass and richness on adult dung-fly abundance. Our results also reveal that dung beetles are not solely responsible for fly control and that other factors linked to land use are influencing the populations of these detritus-feeding insects.

We have examined the expression of BPIFB1 (LPLUNC1), the prototypic two-domain containing family member, in lungs from CF patients and in mouse models of CF lung disease. BPIFB1 was localized in CF lung samples along with BPIFA1, MUC5AC, CD68 and NE and directly compared to histologically normal lung tissues and that of bacterial pneumonia. We generated novel antibodies to mouse BPIF proteins to conduct similar studies on ENaC transgenic (ENaC-Tg) mice, a model for CF-like lung disease. Small airways in CF demonstrated marked epithelial staining of BPIFB1 in goblet cells but staining was absent from alveolar regions. BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 were not co-localised in the diseased lungs. In ENaC-Tg mice there was strong staining of both proteins in the airways and luminal contents. This was most marked for BPIFB1 and was noted within 2 weeks of birth. The two proteins were present in distinct cells within epithelium. BPIFB1 was readily detected in BAL from ENaC-Tg mice but was absent from wild-type mice. Alterations in the expression of BPIF proteins is associated with CF lung disease in humans and mice. It is unclear if this elevation of protein production, which results from phenotypic alteration of the cells within the diseased epithelium, plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

However, placement of clear cell carcinomas into one of these 2 groups has been problematic as they exhibit morphologic, molecular, and clinical features that do not entirely resemble either Type I or Type II tumors. The present study aimed at better elucidating the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of clear cell carcinomas, in comparison with the 2 main broad categories. To this end, a panel of classic clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical parameters, including estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), ER beta, progesterone receptor, Ki67, p53, and HER2/neu was evaluated in 71 Type I, 157 Type II, and 21 clear cell carcinomas. Overall, findings from the present study support the idea that ovarian clear cell carcinomas are neither Type I nor Type II carcinomas of the ovary; indeed, results obtained showed that similarities between clear cell carcinomas and Type I were limited to the patient's age, tumor dimension, incidence of lymph node and extranodal metastases, and p53 labeling index, whereas the patient's age and incidence of extranodal metastases were the only parameters comparable with the Type II group. The hormonal receptor profile of clear cell carcinomas was characterized by low expression of nuclear ER alpha and progesterone receptor, and by almost exclusively nuclear ER beta immunopositivity, features significantly different from both Type I and II tumors. Finally, the percentage of HER2/neu-positive samples in clear cell carcinomas was 10- and 2.5-fold higher than Type I and Type II ovarian tumors, respectively. In conclusion, our study provides insights into clear cell carcinoma that could help in explaining its unique prognostic features, and, eventually, in orienting toward new therapeutic options.

During early events of infection, these viruses manipulate preexisting host cell signaling pathways to allow successful infection. The different proteins that compose viral particles are therefore likely to have critical functions not only in viral structures and in entry into target cell but also in evasion of the host's antiviral response. In this study, we analyzed the protein composition of bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4), a close relative of the human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Using mass spectrometry-based approaches, we identified 37 viral proteins associated with extracellular virions, among which 24 were resistant to proteinase K treatment of intact virions. Analysis of proteins associated with purified capsid-tegument preparations allowed us to define protein localization. In parallel, in order to identify some previously undefined open reading frames, we mapped peptides detected in whole virion lysates onto the six frames of the BoHV-4 genome to generate a proteogenomic map of BoHV-4 virions. Furthermore, we detected important glycosylation of three envelope proteins: gB, gH, and gp180. Finally, we identified 38 host proteins associated with BoHV-4 virions; 15 of these proteins were resistant to proteinase K treatment of intact virions. Many of these have important functions in different cellular pathways involved in virus infection. This study extends our knowledge of gammaherpesvirus virions composition and provides new insights for understanding the life cycle of these viruses.

During a surveillance study from 2005 to 2010, a novel alphacoronavirus, BatCoV HKU10, was detected in two very different bat species, Ro-BatCoV HKU10 in Leschenault's rousettes (Rousettus leschenaulti) (fruit bats in the suborder Megachiroptera) in Guangdong and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 in Pomona leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros pomona) (insectivorous bats in the suborder Microchiroptera) in Hong Kong. Although infected bats appeared to be healthy, Pomona leaf-nosed bats carrying Hi-BatCoV HKU10 had lower body weights than uninfected bats. To investigate possible interspecies transmission between the two bat species, the complete genomes of two Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and six Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains were sequenced. Genome and phylogenetic analyses showed that Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 represented a novel alphacoronavirus species, sharing highly similar genomes except in the genes encoding spike proteins, which had only 60.5% amino acid identities. Evolution of the spike protein was also rapid in Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2005 to 2006 but stabilized thereafter. Molecular-clock analysis dated the most recent common ancestor of all BatCoV HKU10 strains to 1959 (highest posterior density regions at 95% [HPDs], 1886 to 2002) and that of Hi-BatCoV HKU10 to 1986 (HPDs, 1956 to 2004). The data suggested recent interspecies transmission from Leschenault's rousettes to Pomona leaf-nosed bats in southern China. Notably, the rapid adaptive genetic change in BatCoV HKU10 spike protein by similar to 40% amino acid divergence after recent interspecies transmission was even greater than the similar to 20% amino acid divergence between spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) in bats and civets.

Thus, it is of utmost importance that species are delimited in an accurate and biologically meaningful way. However, due to morphologically similar, cryptic species, and processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, this is far from a trivial task. Here, we examine the accuracy and sensitivity to sampling strategy of three recently developed methods that aim to delimit species from multi-locus DNA sequence data without a priori assignments of samples to putative species. Specifically, we simulate data at two species tree depths and a variety of sampling strategies ranging from five alleles per species and five loci to 20 alleles per species and 100 loci to test (1) Structurama, (2) Gaussian clustering, and (3) nonparametric delimitation. We find that Structurama accurately delimits even relatively recently diverged (greater than 1.5 N generations) species when sampling 10 or more loci. We also find that Gaussian clustering delimits more deeply divergent species (greater than 2.5 N generations) relatively well, but is not sufficiently sensitive to delimit more recently diverged species. Finally, we find that nonparametric delimitation performs well with 25 or more loci if gene trees are known without error, but performs poorly with estimated gene genealogies, frequently over-splitting species and mis-assigning samples. We thus suggest that Structurama represents a powerful tool for use in species delimitation. It should be noted, however, that intraspecific population structure may be delimited using this or any of the methods tested herein. We argue that other methods, such as other species delimitation methods requiring a priori putative species assignments (e.g. SpeDeSTEM, Bayesian species delimitation), and other types of data (e.g. morphological, ecological, behavioral) be incorporated in conjunction with these methods in studies attempting to delimit species.

Therefore, invasion of and adaptation to novel habitats imply a gradual increase in population density, from that at or below what was found in the ancestral habitat to a density that may reach higher levels in the novel habitat following adaptation to that habitat. We tested this prediction of invasion biology by analyzing data on population density of breeding birds in their ancestral rural habitats and in matched nearby urban habitats that have been colonized recently across a continental latitudinal gradient. We estimated population density in the two types of habitats using extensive point census bird counts, and we obtained information on the year of urbanization when population density in urban habitats reached levels higher than that of the ancestral rural habitat from published records and estimates by experienced ornithologists. Both the difference in population density between urban and rural habitats and the year of urbanization were significantly repeatable when analyzing multiple populations of the same species across Europe. Population density was on average 30 % higher in urban than in rural habitats, although density reached as much as 100-fold higher in urban habitats in some species. Invasive urban bird species that colonized urban environments over a long period achieved the largest increases in population density compared to their ancestral rural habitats. This was independent of whether species were anciently or recently urbanized, providing a unique cross-validation of timing of urban invasions. These results suggest that successful invasion of urban habitats was associated with gradual adaptation to these habitats as shown by a significant increase in population density in urban habitats over time.

However, many cactus pollination systems are generalized as their flowers are pollinated by a wide spectrum of animals. For example, cactus species with white flowers, nocturnal anthesis and extended floral cycles would present generalized pollination systems in which both nocturnal and diurnal visitors could be effective pollinators. In this article, we tested this hypothesis by studying the pollination biology of Echinopsis schickendantzii, an Andean cactus with sphingophilous flowers. In addition, we evaluated whether the cactus's pollination system is complementary or redundant regarding the relative contributions of nocturnal and diurnal pollinators. Specifically, we studied the floral cycle, the reproductive system and the pollination effectiveness of floral visitors. The flowers of E. schickendantzii are self-incompatible; they opened at crepuscule and have an extended floral cycle. Moths were frequent visitors at night, whereas bees were frequent visitors during the day; both were effective pollinators of the cactus. Our results indicated that the flowers of this species present phenotypic, functional and ecological generalization, and their fruit set is determined by the contributions of both pollinator functional groups, i.e., they have complementary pollination systems. These results support the hypothesis that cacti in the extra-tropical deserts of South America have generalized pollination systems.

Trap-building predators represent case studies in such plasticity as the characteristics of their traps are dependent upon the substrate available. We investigated the effect of sand particle size on pit construction in antlions (Euroleon nostras), sand-dwelling insect larvae that build pitfall traps to capture prey. The pit construction behavior of the species comprises six stages. When antlions were exposed to different sand particle sizes, their behavior differed in terms of the occurrence and duration of particular stages and in the frequency of jerks produced during sand tossing. Jerk frequency was negatively correlated with sand particle size and also changed during pit construction. Furthermore, at larger particle sizes, individuals occasionally constructed irregular traps with a figure of eight shape, and they crossed the center of the truncated cone during deepening. In the largest substrate, particle size of antlions did not construct pits. Our results demonstrate that variation in traps under differing environmental conditions stems directly from behavioral plasticity in this species.

Results from the SEARCH Database","Abstract: Background: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP). It is unclear whether this is due to technical challenges related to operating on obese men or other biologic factors.Objective: To examine whether obesity predicts higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (as a measure of residual PSA-producing tissue) after RP and if this accounts for the greater BCR risk in obese men.Design, setting, and participants: A retrospective analysis of 1038 RP patients from 2001 to 2010 in the multicenter US Veterans Administration-based Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database with median follow-up of 41 mo.Intervention: All patients underwent RP.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We evaluated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and ultrasensitive PSA nadir within 6 mo after RP. Adjusted proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between BMI and BCR with and without PSA nadir.Results and limitations: Mean BMI was 28.5 kg/m(2). Higher BMI was associated with higher PSA nadir on both univariable (p = 0.001) and multivariable analyses (p < 0.001). Increased BMI was associated with increased BCR risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; p = 0.007). Adjusting for PSA nadir slightly attenuated, but did not eliminate, this association (HR: 1.04, p = 0.043). When stratified by PSA nadir, obesity only significantly predicted BCR in men with an undetectable nadir (p = 0.006). Unfortunately, other clinically relevant end points such as metastasis or mortality were not available.Conclusions: Obese men are more likely to have a higher PSA nadir, suggesting that either more advanced disease or technical issues confound an ideal operation.

The ability to predict therapeutic response, identify individuals at greatest risk for adverse clinical responses after therapeutic radiation doses, or identify individuals at high risk for carcinogenesis from environmental or medical radiation exposures has a medical and economic impact on both the individual and society at large. As radiotherapy incorporates particles, particularly particles larger than protons, into therapy, the need for such discriminators, (i.e., biomarkers) will become ever more important. Cellular assays for survival, DNA repair, or chromatid/chromosomal analysis have been used to identify at-risk individuals, but they are not clinically applicable. Newer approaches, such as genome-wide analysis of gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms and small copy number variations within chromosomes, are examples of technologies being applied to the discovery process. Gene expression analysis of primary or immortalized human cells suggests that there are distinct gene expression patterns associated with radiation exposure to both low and high linear energy transfer radiations and that those most radiosensitive are discernible by their basal gene expression patterns. However, because the genetic alterations that drive radio response may be subtle and cumulative, the need for large sample sizes of specific cell or tissue types is required. A systems biology approach will ultimately be necessary. Potential biomarkers from cell lines or animal models will require validation in a human setting where possible and before being considered as a credible biomarker some understanding of the molecular mechanism is necessary.

The recently-released workshop report stresses that the leadership position of the United States in fields where accelerators play an important part is being seriously eroded because of lack of coordinated agency support for accelerator research and development. This is particularly true for biology and medicine. Radiation therapy with beams of protons and light ions was pioneered in the United States and has proven successful in the treatment of several different tumor sites in the body. Proton therapy is available in the United States in a number of centers; however, all but one contain accelerator and beam-delivery components manufactured abroad. Light-ion therapy is only available overseas. Why has the United States lost its lead in this field? The Working Group noted that in other countries, central governments are subsidizing construction and technology development by their industries, whereas in the United States funding for purchasing and building clinical facilities must be raised from private sources. As a result, most proton facilities in the United States, by virtue of having to recover investment costs, favor reimbursable treatments, detracting from the development of research protocols. The financial hurdle for starting a light-ion facility in the United States has been totally prohibitive for the private-equity market. While technological advances are being made that will provide some reduction in capital costs, the field will not flourish in the United States until effective funding means are developed that do not put the full burden on the private sector.

Tissue harvest was performed on the hind limbs of seven dogs. Stromal cells were isolated via serial expansion in culture. After four passages, tenogenesis was induced using either ascorbic acid alone or in conjunction with GDF-5. CD44, tenomodulin, collagen I, and collagen III expression levels were compared for each culture condition at 7 and 14 days following induction. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to evaluate cell morphology and production of tenomodulin and collagen I. SMSCs and BMSCs were successfully isolated in culture. Following tenocytic induction, SMSCs demonstrated an increased mean relative expression of tenomodulin, collagen I, and collagen III at 14 days. BMSCs only showed increased mean relative expression of collagen I, and collagen III at 14 days. IHC revealed positive staining for tenomodulin and collagen I at 14 days for both cell types. The morphology of skeletal muscle derived stromal cells at 14 days had an organized appearance in contrast to the haphazard arrangement of the bone marrow derived cells. GDF-5 did not affect gene expression, cell staining, or cell morphology significantly. Stromal cells from either bone marrow or skeletal muscle can be induced to increase expression of matrix genes; however, based on expression of tenomodulin and cell culture morphology SMSCs may be a more ideal candidate for tenocytic differentiation.

Although the E-cadherin has been shown to mediate a broad-ranging cellular signals and functions, its effects on matrix metabolism of intervertebral discs (IVDs) are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of E-cadherin on IVD matrix synthesis using pharmacological and molecular biology methods. We showed that high levels of the E-cadherin are expressed in rabbits IVD cells. Our study indicates that the ectopic expression of E-cadherin can stimulate matrix anabolism of the IVD cells, which was evidenced by increased expression of the matrix macromolecules aggrecan and collagen II. We found that E-cadherin induces the expression of BMP-4 and BMP-7 genes and enhances Smad1/5 phosphorylation. Blocking BMP activity uses noggin suppressed E-cadherin-mediated upregulation of aggrecan and collagen II. Moreover, inhibition of Smad1/5 phosphorylation by dorsomorphin significantly repressed the E-cadherin induced expression of aggrecan and collagen II at the both mRNA and protein levels. Together this study demonstrates that the E-cadherin stimulates the synthesis of IVD matrix macromolecules aggrecan and collagen II through the induction of BMP genes and enhancement of the Smad1/5 phosphorylation. Thus E-cadherin may have value in the treatment of degenerated discs. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Therefore, osteoarthritic (OA) samples (n?=?11) were compared with synovial membrane-like interface tissues from revision THR (n?=?10). VEGF-A and its receptors were stained using streptavidin-immunoperoxidase method. Their regulation by hypoxia and cytokines were studied in cultured fibroblasts using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). VEGFR1+ lining cells (p?<?0.01), stromal fibroblast-like cells (p?=?0.001) and stromal macrophage-like cells (p?<?0.05) were more numerous in rTHR than in OA. As to VEGFR2+, only stromal fibroblast-like cells in rTHR outnumbered those found in OA (p?<?0.05). VEGFRs in synovial fibroblasts were not affected by hypoxia, but VEGF increased 2.4-fold (p?<?0.05). Interleukin-4 up-regulated VEGFR1 expression 23-fold. This is the first study to describe a difference between rTHR and OA in VEGF receptors, particularly VEGFR1. Hypoxia increased VEGF, but the VEGFR1 increase in the lining and stroma is probably IL-4 driven, in accordance with the M2-type macrophage dominance in interface tissues. VEGF/VEGFR system is also affected by hypoxia and may play a role in angiogenesis and bone pathology in aseptic loosening of total hip implants. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The structure of VSV-G has been solved in two different conformations and fusion is known to be triggered by low pH. To investigate Class III fusion mechanisms, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the VSV-G prefusion structure in two different protonation states: at physiological pH (pH 7) and low pH present in the endosome (pH 5). Domain IV containing the fusion loops, which need to interact with the target membrane, exhibits the highest mobility. Energetic analyses revealed weakened interaction between Domain IV and the protein core at pH 5, which can be attributed to two pairs of structurally neighboring conserved and differentially protonated residues in the Domain IVcore interface. Energetic calculations also demonstrated that the interaction between the subunits in the core of the trimeric VSV-G is strengthened at pH 5, mainly due to newly formed interactions between the C-terminal loop of Domain II and the N-terminus of the adjacent subunit. A pair of interacting residues in this interface that is affected by differential protonation was shown to be the main effectors of this phenomenon. The results of this study thus enhance the mechanistic understanding of the effects of protonation changes in VSV-G. Proteins 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, in patients with poor acoustic windows, lower correlations were reported despite the use of contrast. We hypothesized that power modulation (PM) RT3DE imaging that uses low mechanical indices and provides uniform LV opacification could overcome this problem. Accordingly, we sought to: (i) Test the feasibility of quantification of LV volumes and EF from contrast-enhanced (CE) PM RT3DE images, (ii) validate this technique against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reference and (iii) test its clinical value by quantifying the improvement in accuracy and reproducibility. We studied 20 patients who underwent CMR, harmonic nonenhanced RT3DE and CE PM RT3DE imaging on the same day. All images were analyzed to obtain end-systolic and end-diastolic LV volumes (EDV, ESV) and calculate EF. To determine the reproducibility of each RT3DE technique, imaging was repeated in the same setting by a second sonographer. In addition, patients were divided according to the quality of their RT3DE images into two groups, for which agreement with CMR and reproducibility were calculated separately. CE PM RT3DE imaging improved the accuracy of EDV, ESV and EF measurements in patients with poor acoustic windows without significantly affecting those in patients with optimal images. In addition, CE PM RT3DE imaging improved the reproducibility of the measurements, as reflected by a twofold decrease in intermeasurement variability. Importantly, the variability in CE PM RT3DE-derived volumes and EF was under 10%, irrespective of image quality. This methodology may become the new standard for LV size and function, which will be particularly important in patients with poor acoustic windows or contraindications to CMR.

In this article, an automatic whole breast lesion detection system based on the naive Bayes classifier using the PC-based US system Terason t3000 (Terason Ultrasound, Burlington, MA, USA) with a hand-held probe is proposed. To easily retrieve the US images for any regions of the breast, a clock-based storing system is proposed to record the scanned US images. A computer-aided detection (CAD) system is also developed to save the physicians' time for a huge volume of scanned US images. The pixel classification of the US is based on the naive Bayes classifier for the proposed lesion detection system. The pixels of the US are classified into two types: lesions or normal tissues. The connected component labeling is applied to find the suspected lesions in the image. Consequently, the labeled two-dimensional suspected regions are separated into two clusters and further checked by two-phase lesion selection criteria for the determination of the real lesion, while reducing the false-positive rate. The free-response operative characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed system. According to the experimental results of 31 cases with 33 lesions, the proposed system yields a 93.4% (31/33) sensitivity at 4.22 false positives (FPs) per hundred slices. Moreover, the speed for the proposed detection scheme achieves 12.3 frames per second (fps) with an Intel Dual-Core Quad 3 GHz processor and can be also effectively and efficiently used for other screening systems.

Four-hundred eighty-two patients with 483 invasive breast cancers who had no suspicious findings on preoperative axillary US were included in this study. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection. False-negative and true-negative results were compared in terms of age, body mass index (BMI), T-stage, pathologic N-stage and final diagnosis of breast cancer. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Of the 483 axillae with negative results on axillary US, 93 axillae of 93 patients showed false-negative results and the negative predictive value of axillary US was 80.8% (390/483). Seventy-five axillae (15.5%, 75/483) had N1 and 18 axillae (3.7%, 18/483) had N2 or N3 disease. Eighteen false-negative results with N2/N3 disease showed a significantly higher T stage (T2/T3) than those with N1 disease. As the T-stage increased, false-negative results were found more often on preoperative axillary US (p < 0.05). Age, BMI and final diagnosis of primary breast cancer were not associated with false-negative results on preoperative axillary US. Preoperative axillary US alone is insufficiently specific to obviate the need for SLNB because of the substantial number of false-negative results in patients with invasive breast cancer, although preoperative axillary US alone may exclude most cases of N2 and N3 disease.

Thirty-three lesions (18.4%) showed linear enhancement, a linear-shaped positive enhancement in the RFA-treated area.

Although there was no significant difference in local recurrence rate between the lesions with (3/17) and without linear enhancement (10/35), local tumor progression inside the ablation zone occurred only in the lesions with linear enhancement. In conclusion, linear enhancement inside the RFA-treated area should be followed up within 7 months because it has a risk of local tumor progression.

Representative of the latter, histotripsy uses HIFU at low duty factor to create energetic bubble clouds inside tissue to liquefy a region and has the advantages in real-time monitoring and lesion fidelity to treatment planning. We explored the impact of a preconditioning/ heating pulse on histotripsy lesion formation in porcine muscle samples. During sonication, a targeted square region 9 mm wide (lateral to the focal plane) was scanned in a raster pattern with a step size of 0.75 mm. The 20-s exposure at each treatment location consisted of a 5-s duration preconditioning burst at spatial-peak intensities from 0-1386 W/cm(2) followed by 5000 tone bursts at high intensity (with spatial-peak pulse-average intensity of 47.34 kW/cm(2), spatial-peak temporal-average intensity of 284 W/cm(2), peak compressional pressure of 102 MPa and peak rarefactional pressure of 17 MPa). The temperature increase for all exposures was measured using a thermal imager immediately after each exposure. Lesion volume increased with increasing amplitude of the preconditioning pulse until coagulation was observed, but lesion width/area did not change significantly with the amplitude. In addition, the lesion dimensions became smaller when the global tissue temperature was raised before applying the histotripsy pulsing sequence. Therefore, the benefit of the preconditioning pulse was not caused by global heating. (E-mail: bigelow@iastate.edu) (C) 2012 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Eighteen spleens were treated with either MEUS (n - 9) or MEUS combined with prothrombin (n - 9). The other 18 spleens were treated with TUS only or sham ultrasound exposure and served as the controls. The TUS was operated at a frequency of 831 kHz and a peak negative pressure of 4.8 MPa. Prothrombin was administered intravenously at 20 IU/kg. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and acoustic quantification were performed to assess splenic blood perfusion.

This study investigated the mechanism underlying the US-mediated release of luciferin-loaded MBs through the blood vessels to targeted cells using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) system. The luciferin-loaded MBs comprised an albumin shell with a diameter of 1234 +/- 394 nm (mean +/- SD) and contained 2.48 x 10(9) bubbles/mL; within each MB, the concentration of encapsulated luciferin was 1.48 x 10(-10) mg/bubble. The loading efficiency of luciferin in MBs was only about 19.8%, while maintaining both the bioluminescence and acoustic properties. In vitro and in vivo BLI experiments were performed to evaluate the US-mediated release of luciferin-loaded MBs. For in vitro results, the increase in light emission of luciferin-loaded albumin-shelled MBs after destruction via US sonication (6.24 +/- 0.72 x 10(7) photons/s) was significantly higher than that in the luciferin-loaded albumin-shelled MBs (3.11 +/- 0.33 x 10(7) photons/s) (p < 0.05).

The evidence of structural changes of the cellular outer membrane in both transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images and the more than 20% lactate dehydrogenase release indicates that the increased mAb production is related to the increased cell permeability induced by LIPUS.

Here, we demonstrate ultrasound bioeffects in which the levels of genes in endothelial cells can be significantly altered by ultrasound-stimulated microbubble exposure. These were compared with established effects of radiation on endothelial cells at a gene level. Human-endothelial cells were exposed to ultrasound and microbubbles, radiation or combinations of ultrasound, microbubbles and radiation. Gene expression analyses revealed an up-regulation of genes known to be involved in apoptosis and ceramide-induced apoptotic pathways, including SMPD2, UGT8, COX6B1, Caspase 9 and MAP2K1 with ultrasound-stimulated microbubble exposure but not SMPD1. This was supported by immunohistochemistry and morphologic changes examined with cell microscopy, which showed changes in SMPD1 gene product in cells with microbubble exposure. This supports the hypothesis that ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles can induce significant bioeffect-related changes in gene expression and can affect ceramide signaling pathways in endothelial cells, leading to apoptosis.

ELIP are being developed for molecular imaging and image-guided therapeutic delivery. Stability of the echogenicity of ELIP in physiologic conditions is crucial to their successful translation to clinical use. In this study, we determined the effects of the surrounding media's dissolved air concentration, temperature transition and hydrodynamic pressure on the echogenicity of a chemically modified formulation of ELIP to promote stability and echogenicity. ELIP samples were diluted in porcine plasma or whole blood and pumped through a pulsatile flow system with adjustable hydrodynamic pressures and temperature. B-mode images were acquired using a clinical diagnostic scanner every 5 s for a total duration of 75 s. Echogenicity in porcine plasma was assessed as a function of total dissolved gas saturation. ELIP were added to plasma at room temperature (22 degrees C) or body temperature (37 degrees C) and pumped through a system maintained at 22 degrees C or 37 degrees C to study the effect of temperature transitions on ELIP echogenicity. Echogenicity at normotensive (120/80 mmHg) and hypertensive pressures (145/90 mmHg) was measured. ELIP were echogenic in plasma and whole blood at body temperature under normotensive to hypertensive pressures. Warming of samples from room temperature to body temperature did not alter echogenicity. However, in plasma cooled rapidly from body temperature to room temperature or in degassed plasma, ELIP lost echogenicity within 20 s at 120/80mmHg. The stability of echogenicity of a modified ELIP formulation was determined in vitro at body temperature, physiologic gas concentration and throughout the physiologic pressure range. However, proper care should be taken to ensure that ELIP are not cooled rapidly from body temperature to room temperature as they will lose their echogenic properties. Further in vivo investigations will be needed to evaluate the optimal usage of ELIP as blood pool contrast agents.

The early stage of experimentally induced secondary HAE in 45 rats was studied. Thirty-six HAE lesions in 33 rats, confirmed by pathologic examination, were examined by ultrasound (US), color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and then CEUS. Thirty-three lesions were found in 30 rats by US, and 30 lesions were detected in 27 rats by CEUS. The sensitivity of US and CEUS was 92% (95% CI 76%-98%) and 82% (95% CI 65%-93%), respectively. US imaging characteristics were categorized into four types: hyperechoic spot (type 1, 45.5%, 15/33), granular hyperechoic spots (type 2, 12.1%, 4/33), hyperechoic lesion (type 3, 30.3%, 10/33) and mixed pattern (type 4, 12.1%, 4/33). CDFI failed to detect blood flow signals in any lesions. CEUS results for 30 lesions showed ring enhancement in the peripheral area during the arterial phase and no filling effect in either the portal or the delayed phase (46.7%, 14/30); ring enhancement combined with central septa enhancement during the arterial phase and portal venous phase (46.7, 14/30), and no enhancement (6.6%, 2/30). The enhanced area, confirmed by pathologic examination, was an inflammatory reaction belt surrounding the lesion. The results of this study suggest that US, with high sensitivity, can be used as a screening method for early HAE lesions in the animal model, while CEUS can be used for displaying the peripheral blood perfusion and vesicle structure.

We have recently demonstrated a novel technique for the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are surface-coated with cationic lipid microbubbles (MBs) and displaced by acoustic radiation force (ARF) to a site of arterial injury. The objective of this study was to characterize ultrasound parameters for effective acoustic-based delivery of cell therapy. In vitro experiments were performed in a vascular flow phantom where MB-tagged MSCs were delivered toward the phantom wall using ARF generated with an intravascular ultrasound catheter. The translation motion velocity and adhesion of the MB-cell complexes were analyzed. Experimental data indicated that MSC radial velocity and adhesion to the vessel phantom increased with the time-averaged ultrasound intensity up to 1.65 W/cm(2), after which no further significant adhesion was observed. Temperature increase from baseline near the catheter was 5.5 +/- 0.8 degrees C with this setting. Using higher time-averaged ultrasound intensities may not significantly benefit the adhesion of MB-cell complexes to the target vessel wall (p = NS), but could cause undesirable biologic effects such as heating to the MB-cell complexes and surrounding tissue. For the highest time-averaged ultrasound intensity of 6.60 W/cm(2), the temperature increase was 11.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C.

Consequently, it was calibrated by the mean and diastolic pressure measured in the finger artery and compared with applanation tonometry, calibrated using the systolic and diastolic pressure in the brachial artery. The mean difference in estimating the mean blood pressure was 0.3 mm Hg (limits of agreement: -11.7 to 12.3 mm Hg). In estimating the systolic blood pressure, the mean difference was 8.0 mm Hg (limits of agreement: -29.8 to 45.8 mm Hg) and showed increasing variation with blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure values can be expected between 0.83 and 1.35 times the control method. In this study, we obtained proof-of-principle for noninvasively measuring blood pressure in the CCA using continuous finger blood pressure monitoring.

A new expression for the acoustic radiation force function, which is the radiation force per unit energy density and unit cross-sectional surface area for a sphere in a Gaussian beam, is presented in this paper. Numerical results for the radiation force function of a Gaussian beam incident upon the spherical particles are presented for rigid spheres, liquid spheres and elastic spheres immersed in water to illustrate the theory. The radiation force function vs. ka curve, ka being the radius times the wavenumber in the surrounding medium, is discussed for different beam widths. The acoustic radiation force function is determined by the parameters of the particles, with liquid spheres having smaller values than those for rigid and elastic spheres. The beam width also affects the acoustic radiation force function. When the radius of the sphere is larger than the beam width, the beam width has greater effects on the radiation force. This analysis helps analyzing and understanding the effects of the acoustic Gaussian beams on spherical objects.

In this experimental study, we evaluate the performance of the TR-MUSIC algorithm when the interrogated medium contains extended targets that cannot be considered as point scatterers, i.e., the size of the targets is on the order of the ultrasound wavelength or larger. We construct four tissue-mimicking phantoms, each of which contains glass spheres of a given size. We show that the quality of the phantom images obtained using the TR-MUSIC algorithm decreases with increasing sphere size. However, significant improvement is achieved when the image plane is divided into subregions, where each subregion is imaged separately. In this method, the TR-MUSIC calculations are performed on the windowed backscattered signals originating from each subregion. Our study demonstrates that the TR-MUSIC algorithm with time windowing can accurately locate extended targets but cannot provide the shape and reflectivity of the targets.

Although total shear strain elastography was initially proposed for this purpose, it did not evolve beyond the initial reported finite element model (FEM) and simulation studies. One of the major reasons for this was the practical limitation in estimating the tissue motion perpendicular (lateral) to the ultrasound (US) beam as accurately as the motion along the US beam (axial). Nevertheless, there has been a sustained effort in developing methods to improve the lateral motion tracking accuracy and thereby obtain better quality total shear strain elastogram (TSSE). We hypothesize that in some cases, even if good quality TSSE becomes possible, it may still be advantageous to utilize only the axial-shear strain (one of the components of the total shear strain) elastogram (ASSE). Specifically, we show through FEM and corroborating tissue-mimicking gelatin phantom experiments that the unique ""fill-in"" discriminant feature that was introduced recently for asymmetric breast lesion classification is depicted only in the ASSE and not in the TSSE. Note that the presence or conspicuous absence of this feature in ASSE was shown to characterize asymmetric inclusions' boundaries as either loosely-bonded or firmly-bonded to the surrounding, respectively. This might be an important observation because the literature suggests that benign breast lesions tend to be loosely-bonded, while malignant tumors are usually firmly-bonded. The results from the current study demonstrate that the use of shear strain lesion ""fill-in"" as a discriminant feature in the differentiation between asymmetric malignant and benign breast lesions is only possible when using the ASSEs and not the TSSEs.

This study examined anatomical and histological characteristics of genital organs of 60 Poeppig's woolly monkey females in the wild in different reproductive stages, collected by rural hunters in the northeastern Peruvian Amazon. The endometrium, the endometrial glands, and the myometrium showed a significant increase in size related to the follicular growth. In nonpregnant females in the follicular phase, the endometrium, the endometrial glands, and the myometrium showed a significant increase related to the follicular growth. Nonpregnant females in the luteal phase had a thicker endometrium, a greater proliferation of endometrial glands, and a thicker myometrium, compared to females in the follicular phase. Nonpregnant females with small antral follicles presented high amounts of collagen beneath the endometrial epithelium, a sign of endometrial regeneration after menstruation that could be useful for the diagnosis of the reproductive phase in this species. A larger proportion of secreting cervical glands was observed in pregnant females compared to other females. The cervical mucous secretion occupied the lumen of the endocervical canal, assuring that no material could enter the uterus during gestation. The Poeppig's woolly monkey showed different vaginal epithelium features in accordance with the reproductive state of the female, suggesting that vaginal cytology could be a successful methodology with which to characterize the estrous cycle of wild primates. The present reproductive evaluation of Poeppig's woolly monkey provides important information that could improve the methodologies for the diagnosis of the reproductive phase of females, the assisted reproductive techniques in non-human primates, and could also give us opportunity for comparative studies and an insight into the evolution of animal reproductive biology, including humans.

Differentiation of these multinucleated giant cells from precursors is controlled by the cytokine RANKL, which through its receptor RANK initiates a signaling cascade culminating in the activation of transcriptional regulators which induce the expression of the bone degradation machinery. The transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) is the master regulator of this process and in its absence osteoclast differentiation is aborted both in vitro and in vivo. Differential mRNA expression analysis by microarray is used to identify genes of potential physiologic relevance across nearly all biologic systems. We compared the gene expression profile of murine wild-type and NFATc1-deficient osteoclast precursors stimulated with RANKL and identified that the majority of the known genes important for osteoclastic bone resorption require NFATc1 for induction. Here, five novel RANKL-induced, NFATc1-dependent transcripts in the osteoclast are described: Nhedc2, Rhoc, Serpind1, Adcy3 and Rab38. Despite reasonable hypotheses for the importance of these molecules in the bone resorption pathway and their dramatic induction during differentiation, the analysis of mice with mutations in these genes failed to reveal a function in osteoclast biology. Compared to littermate controls, none of these mutants demonstrated a skeletal phenotype in vivo or alterations in osteoclast differentiation or function in vitro. These data highlight the need for rigorous validation studies to complement expression profiling results before functional importance can be assigned to highly regulated genes in any biologic process.

We used a multidisciplinary approach to determine which of these three scenarios underlies the invasion of the tropical ant Wasmannia auropunctata in a Mediterranean region (i.e. Israel). Species distribution models (SDM), phylogeographical analyses at a broad geographical scale and laboratory experiments on appropriate native and invasive populations indicated that Israeli populations followed an invasion scenario in which adaptation to cold occurred at the southern limit of the native range before dispersal to Israel.

Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 degrees C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums.

Recently empirical attention has shifted to the relationships between broader ecological influences (e.g., education, ethnicity and income) and ECC; however, how such determinants interplay in the aetiology of ECC remains unclear. An intermediary mechanism that warrants greater empirical attention is parental influences. This oversight is interesting given the primacy of the parent in governing the child's proximate environment and the likelihood of the child endorsing adaptive or maladaptive health attitudes, beliefs and behaviours. The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of the evidence for parental influences on the development of caries in children aged 0-6 years.Data: All studies testing associations between dental caries and socio-demographic factors, feeding practices, parent attributes, behaviours, oral health, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs in children aged 0-6 years, published between 2006 and 2011.Source: Medline, ISI, Cochrane, Scopus, Global Health and CINAHL databases.Study selection: Fifty-five studies were included from an initial identification of 1805 studies.Conclusions: To date, most research has focused on the association between caries and socio-demographic and feeding factors with few studies exploring parents' attributes, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs, and none exploring possible pathways between the multiple layers of influences potentially accounting for how determinants of ECC operate and traverse individual, familial, community, and socio-cultural contexts.

PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) and c-Kit (stem cell factor receptor) signaling play important roles in initiation and maintenance of malignant glioma. This study demonstrated that long-term culture with imatinib mesylate, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor against PDGFR and c-Kit resulted in reduced cancer stem cell ability in glioblastoma cells through cell differentiation. Derived from RG glioblastoma cells co-cultured with imatinib for 3 months, RG-IM cells showed distinct properties of cell cycle distribution and morphology in addition to significantly decreased ability to form aggregates and colonies in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Increased expression of GFAP (astrocyte marker) and class III beta-tubulin isotype (Tuj1, neuron marker) were detected with morphology like neurons or astrocytes in RG-IM cells. Furthermore, decreased expression of stem cell markers, i.e., CD133, Oct-3/4, nestin, and Bmi1, and increased terminal neural cell markers, GFAP, Tuj1, etc., were identified in RG-IM at the mRNA level. All these markers were changed in RG cells when PDGFRB and c-Kit expression were double knocked down by siRNA. Cell differentiation agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) caused similar effect as that with imatinib in RG cells, while adding PDGF-B and SCF in RG-IM resulted in cell dedifferentiation to some extent. Moreover, differentiation in RG cells treated by imatinib or ATRA was mainly driven by MAPK signaling pathways.

Special attention is given to the emergence of new diseases or the re-emergence of old ones on several crops, and on the results and problems encountered by using grafting, biofumigation and other non-chemical control methods. The search for effective, economically and environmentally sound methods for soil and substrate disinfestation remains a continuous and challenging task for growers, despite intensive research. The European Regulation No 1107/2009, concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and the European Directive No 2009/128/EC, establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides, requires, by 2014, that all professional users implement the general principles of IPM.

Herein we explore the impact of the density of T and B lymphocytes in prostate cancer tissue on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy in 3261 prostate cancer tissue samples. The number of prostate cancer-infiltrating CD3-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells per tissue spot in a tissue microarray format was determined by immunohistochemistry and was correlated with clinical and pathological data from the same patient cohort. Patients with very low and very high numbers of CD3-positive T cells per tissue spot had a significantly shorter PSA recurrence-free survival compared to patients with intermediate numbers of T cells (p=0.0188). Furthermore, a high number of CD3-positive T cells per tissue spot was associated with fusion type prostate cancer identified by ERG expression analysis. The number of CD20-positive B cells per tissue spot was not associated with other clinical and histopathological parameters. This study indicates that the density of T but not B cells plays a functional role in the biology of prostate cancer and may have an impact on clinical outcome in this frequent neoplasia.

An important surface parameter is the surface roughness on both the micrometer and nanometer scales in the lateral direction. Two approaches have been combined to create two-dimensional roughness gradients by adding a nanoparticle density gradient onto a gradient of micro-featured roughness. All fabricated gradients were extensively characterized by SEM, AFM and optical profilometry to ensure their quality and to determine the roughness parameter Re along the gradient. Additionally, a Fourier-transform approach was applied that allows a wavelength-dependent analysis of the surface topography. Since cell-culture assays require replicate experiments, a replica technique was used to create copies of the master gradient. Creating a negative replica in an elastomeric material served as a mold for a subsequent ceramic-casting process. A positive replica was then formed from epoxy resin, which was subsequently coated with titanium and used for cell studies. Finally, these gradients were used in cell-culture assays to determine cellular response to surface roughness. The results clearly demonstrate the influence of surface roughness on the production by osteoblasts of markers for osteogenesis. It was shown that high roughness in the micrometer range, combined with an intermediate nanofeature density (30-40 features/mu m(2)), leads to the highest degree of osteopontin production after 14 days.

To fully accomplish this potential, the successful application of separation processes for the isolation and purification of stem cells and stem cell-derived cells is a crucial issue. Although separation methods have been used over the past decades for the isolation and enrichment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells for transplantation in hemato-oncological settings, recent achievements in the stem cell field have created new challenges including the need for novel scalable separation processes with a higher resolution and more cost-effective. Important examples are the need for high-resolution methods for the separation of heterogeneous populations of multipotent adult stem cells to study their differential biological features and clinical utility, as well as for the depletion of tumorigenic cells after pluripotent stem cell differentiation. Focusing on these challenges, this review presents a critical assessment of separation processes that have been used in the stem cell field, as well as their current and potential applications. The techniques are grouped according to the fundamental principles that govern cell separation, which are defined by the main physical, biophysical, and affinity properties of cells. A special emphasis is given to novel and promising approaches such as affinity-based methods that take advantage of the use of new ligands (e.g., aptamers, lectins), as well as to novel biophysical-based methods requiring no cell labeling and integrated with microscale technologies.

Here, we apply a synthetic hybrid promoter approach for the creation of strong promoter libraries in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic hybrid promoters are composed of two modular componentsthe enhancer element, consisting of tandem repeats or combinations of upstream activation sequences (UAS), and the core promoter element. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with three main case studies. First, we establish a dynamic range of constitutive promoters and in doing so expand transcriptional capacity of the strongest constitutive yeast promoter, PGPD, by 2.5-fold in terms of mRNA levels. Second, we demonstrate the capacity to impart synthetic regulation through a hybrid promoter approach by adding galactose activation and removing glucose repression. Third, we establish a collection of galactose-inducible hybrid promoters that span a nearly 50-fold dynamic range of galactose-induced expression levels and increase the transcriptional capacity of the Gal1 promoter by 15%. These results demonstrate that promoters in S. cerevisiae, and potentially all yeast, are enhancer limited and a synthetic hybrid promoter approach can expand, enhance, and control promoter activity.

Here, we show that a modified DNA Assembler approach can be used to rapidly assemble multiple-gene biosynthetic pathways in yeast and then integrate these assembled pathways at a site-specific location in the chloroplast genome of the microalgal species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a proof of concept, this method was used to successfully integrate and functionally express up to three reporter proteins (AphA6, AadA, and GFP) in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. An analysis of the relative gene expression of the engineered strains showed significant differences in the mRNA expression levels of the reporter genes and thus highlights the importance of proper promoter/untranslated region selection when constructing a target pathway. This new method represents a useful genetic tool in the construction and integration of complex biochemical pathways into the chloroplast genome of microalgae and should aid current efforts to engineer algae for biofuels production and other desirable natural products.

Eligible studies were control-matched, population-based and hospital-based studies that addressed the outcome of patients diagnosed during pregnancy or 1-year afterwards. The primary and secondary end-points were overall and disease-free survival respectively. Pooling of data was done using the random effect model.Results: 30 studies were included in this meta-analysis (3,628 cases and 37,100 controls). PABC patients had a significantly higher risk of death compared to those with non-pregnancy-related breast cancer (pooled hazard ratio (pHR): 1.44; 95% CI [1.27-1.63]). The same results were encountered on restricting the analysis to HRs of multivariate analyses (pHR: 1.40 [1.17-1.67]). A clearer trend of poorer outcome was seen in those diagnosed postpartum (pHR: 1.84; 95% CI [1.28-2.65]) than those diagnosed during pregnancy (pHR: 1.29; 95% CI [0.74-2.24]). DFS analysis showed a significantly higher risk of relapse associated with PABC as well (pHR: 1.60 [1.19-2.16]).Conclusion: Our results show that PABC is independently associated with poor survival particularly those diagnosed shortly post-partum. This underscores a possible impact of the pregnant breast microenvironment on the biology and consequently the prognosis of these tumors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular crosstalk between expression mechanisms has been identified in a range of cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme. However, hardly any literature exists that addresses whether cancer stem cells utilize these same interconnected pathways. Protein factors commonly implicated in malignant tumors include extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), N-cadherin, and integrin alpha 6. Although studies have reported the molecular crosstalk involved among these proteins, the present study illustrates the importance of the ERK transduction pathway in N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 regulated invasion in GSCs. Conversely, the data also suggests that GSCs rely on N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 interaction to regulate ERK signaling. Moreover, confocal visualization revealed the co-localization of N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 in GSCs and clinical surgical biopsies extracted from glioma patients. Interestingly. ERK knockdown reduced this co-localization. Upon co-culturing GSCs with human umbilical cord blood stem cells (hUCBSCs), we observed a subsequent decrease in pERK, N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 expression. In addition, co-culturing hUCBSCs with GSCs decreased co-localization of N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 in GSCs. Our results demonstrate the dynamic interplay among ERK, N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 in GSC invasion and also reveal the therapeutic potential of hUCBSCs in treating the molecular crosstalk observed in GSC-regulated invasion.

Average infection prevalence was 0.15 across all surveyed populations (range 0-0.29) and only the site with the smallest sample size (n = 5) was negative. Three genotypes differing by 2.6-4.1 % in a 271 bp region of 16S rRNA gene were identified. Two variants co-occurred in sites in North Carolina and New York, but were not observed in the same tick at those sites. The third genotype was found only in Georgia. Phylogenetic analysis of this fragment indicated that the three variants are more closely related to ""Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii"" genotypes from other tick species than to each other. This variation suggests that multiple independent introductions occurred in A. americanum which may provide insight into bacterial spread within its ecosystem and parasitism on this tick. Whether the presence of this bacterium affects acquisition or maintenance of other pathogens and symbionts in A. americanum or the survival, biology and evolution of the tick itself is unknown.

The underwater video system VideoSolo, designed for use in remote places, combines advantages in comparison to older systems necessitating the presence of a ship and whose autonomy is generally limited in time due to biofouling. All these issues have been resolved in VideoSolo, a fully autonomous long-term system, programmable, easy to set up and deploy (the housing weighs only 3 kg). It has sufficient energy storage and an anti-biofouling system in the form of its hydro-wiper, enabling continuous operation for up to one month. The experiment was conducted in a remote place (Glorioso Island, SW Indian Ocean) where the system was installed in front of the same coral colony (1 m(2)) at a depth of 8 m. Data was recorded in May for two subsequent years and six times per day (between 6 am and 4 pm). The analysis of the video sequences enabled the recording of 6224 individuals of 75 species belonging to 16 families over 41 days of experiment. At a small spatial scale, fish assemblages were variable over time at the three temporal scales studied. The number of individuals and species observed was variable between years whilst the number of individuals observed per day remained relatively stable through time. When occurrences were considered, less variation was observed between years. Analyses of temporal fish variability on the most abundant families revealed that the abundances of Acanthuridae, Labridae, Scaridae and resident Pomacentridae were significantly different between years and inversely so for the non-resident Pomacentridae. When the diurnal variations of fish assemblages were considered, the abundances differed significantly over time for Acanthuridae, higher in the morning (6 am and 9 am), and for Scaridae, higher at sunrise (6 am) and sunset (4 pm). The abundances of Pomacentridae and Labridae were stable from sunrise to sunset. The variability between years could be linked to events such as recruitment whilst daily variations could be more related to the effects of tidal cycles whose effects may have created periodic feeding opportunities. VideoSolo has demonstrated its efficiency and has remarkable potential in the field of aquatic biology in any location, as no human presence is required for it to work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

NRBP1 interacts directly with TSC-22, a potential tumor suppressor gene that is differently expressed in prostate cancer. Consequently, we analyzed the role of NRBP1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and its expression on prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMA). METHODS The effect of NRBP1 expression on tumor cell growth was analyzed by using RNAi. NRBP1 protein expression was evaluated on two TMAs containing prostate samples from more than 1,000 patients. Associations with clinico-pathological features, the proliferation marker Ki67 and survival data were analyzed. RESULTS RNAi mediated silencing of NRBP1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in reduced cell growth (P?<?0.05). TMA analysis revealed NRBP1 protein expression in benign prostate hyperplasia in 6% as compared to 60% in both, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer samples. Strong NRBP1 protein expression was restricted to prostate cancer and correlated with higher expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (P?<?0.05). Further, patients with strong NRBP1 protein expression showed poor clinical outcomes (P?<?0.05). Analysis of matched localized cancer tissues before and after castration revealed that post-therapy-related repression of NRBP1 expression was significantly associated with better overall survival. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that expression of NRBP1 is up-regulated during the progression of prostate cancer and that high NRBP1 expression is linked with poor prognosis and enhanced tumor cell growth.

Suppose we interpret the entropy of a random object as a measurement of the uncertainty about its outcome. This measurement is expected to decrease when the object's outcome is confined into a shrinking interval. Entropies conforming to this intuition are thus sensible and likely useful measures of uncertainty. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Shannon entropy of an absolutely continuous random variable to be an increasing function of the interval. Similar results are also obtained for the Renyi entropy of absolutely. continuous random variables and their convolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The wall of a carbon nanotube undergoes a collapse and a corresponding propagation of the collapse when a torsion loading applied to the tube is beyond a critical value. The van der Waals force between the encapsulated DNA molecule and the collapsed wall of the nanotube on one hand is a driving force to push the molecule out of the tube, while may also prevent the ejection when the onset of the collapsed wall is in front of the molecule. To ensure a complete DNA ejection, a design of a stopper, a small fixed portion on the carbon nanotube to prevent the collapsed wall from propagating in front of the DNA molecule, is developed. The effects of the environmental temperature, the torsion loading, and the size of the nanotube on the delivering process of the DNA molecule are also examined. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of ejection of DNA molecules from carbon nanotubes subjected to torsion and provide guidance on designs of the DNA delivery in biology and medical applications.

Upon addition of Zn2+ to solutions of CTMPA, an observable blue to light red color change occurs that can be monitored by using UV-vis spectroscopy. Concomitantly, a remarkably hypsochromic shift (ca.140 nm) in the emission maximum of CTMPA takes place from 730 nm to 590 nm. The observations indicate that association of the probe with Zn2+ leads to shortening of the conjugated, pi-electron system in the cyanine dye, the phenomenon likely responsible for the large hypsochromic shift observed in emission spectra. Since CTMPA has meritorious features, including a large spectral shift induced by Zn2+, a low fluorescence background and a high sensitivity toward Zn2+, CTMPA was employed to monitor endogeneous zinc ions released during apoptosis and trace intact Zn2+ during zebrafish development. Owing to its low background and high sensitivity, CTMPA serves as the first probe for fluorescence detection of neuromasts in zebrafish. The results obtained from experiments using live cells and organisms suggest that CTMPA will be a highly useful probe in zinc biology studies. The effort has demonstrated that a strategy, which relies on changes in the pi-electron conjugation length of cyanine molecules promoted by guest coordination, has great potential for the creation of cyanine-based probes.

The generation of bio-artificial muscles from satellite cells has been ongoing for about 15 years, but has never been used for generation of meat, while it already is a great source of animal protein.In order to serve as a credible alternative to livestock meat, lab or factory grown meat should be efficiently produced and should mimic meat in all of its physical sensations, such as visual appearance, smell, texture and of course, taste. This is a formidable challenge even though all the technologies to create skeletal muscle and fat tissue have been developed and tested. The efficient culture of meat will primarily depend on culture conditions such as the source of medium and its composition. Protein synthesis by cultured skeletal muscle cells should further be maximized by finding the optimal combination of biochemical and physical conditions for the cells. Many of these variables are known, but their interactions are numerous and need to be mapped. This involves a systematic, if not systems, approach. Given the urgency of the problems that the meat industry is facing, this endeavor is worth undertaking. As an additional benefit, culturing meat may provide opportunities for production of novel and healthier products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, several models for lymphatic vascular research and markers specific for lymphatic endothelium have been characterized. Despite these significant achievements, our understanding of the early lymphatic development is still rather limited. The purpose of the study was to further define early lymphatic differentiation regulatory pathways. In the present study, we have developed conditions leading to lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation under both serum-rich and serum-free conditions, using the coculture system of Flk-1-positive vascular precursors derived from murine embryonic stem (ES) cells grown on an OP9 stromal cell layer. In this work, we also identified Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) as a negative regulator of lymphvasculogenesis from ES-derived vascular progenitors. Finally, we could show that TGF beta 1 addition decreases COUP-TFII and Sox18 mRNA levels, which are two transcription factors known to be involved in early lymphatic endothelial differentiation. Taken together these findings support the concept that manipulating the TGF beta signaling pathway may represent an interesting target to favor lymphatic endothelial cell expansion for cell replacement strategies.

To more definitively study the role of endogenously produced PAI-1 in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) PANC-1 cell line biology, we used anti-PAI-1 shRNA to create stable PAI-1 deficient cells (PD-PANC-1s). PD-PANC-1s exhibited a heterogeneous morphology. While the majority of cells exhibited a cuboidal shape similar to the parental PANC-1 or the vector-infected control cells, numerous large cells with long filopodia and a neuronal-like appearance were observed. Although both Vector-control cells and PD-PANC-1s expressed mRNAs that are characteristic of mesenchymal, neural, and epithelial phenotypes, epithelial marker RNAs were up-regulated (e.g., E-cadherin, 32-fold) whereas mesenchymal marker RNAs were down-regulated (e.g., Thy1, ninefold) in PD-PANC-1s, suggesting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Neural markers exhibited both up- and down-regulation. Immunocytochemistry indicated that epithelial-like PD-PANC-1s expressed E-cadherin and beta-catenin in significantly more cells, while neural-like cells exhibited robust expression of organized beta-3-tubulin. PAI-1 and E-cadherin were rarely co-expressed in the same cells. Indeed, examination of PAI-1 and E-cadherin mRNAs expression in additional cell lines yielded clear inverse correlation. Indeed, infection of Colo357 PAC cells (that exhibit high expression of E-cadherin) with PAI-1-expressing adenovirus led to a marked decrease in E-cadherin expression and to enhanced migration of cells from clusters. Our results suggest that endogenous PAI-1 suppresses expression of E-cadherin and differentiation in PAC cells in vitro, supporting its negative impact on tumor prognosis. J. Cell.

Indeed, the aberrant expression of these tiny molecules in human tumors is not just a casual association, but they can exert a causal role, as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, in different steps of the tumorigenic process, from initiation and development to progression toward the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype.An increasing body of evidence has indeed proved the importance of miRNAs in cancer, suggesting their possible use as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers and leading to exploit miRNA-based anticancer therapies, either alone or in combination with current targeted therapies, with the goal to improve disease response and increase cure rates. Here, we review our current knowledge about miRNA involvement in cancer.

Today they are best known for their exceptionally successful application in flat panel displays, but they actually exhibit a plethora of unique and attractive properties that offer tremendous potential for fundamental science as well as innovative applications well beyond the realm of displays. Today this full breadth of the liquid crystalline state of matter is becoming increasingly recognized and numerous new and exciting lines of research are being opened up. We review this exciting development, focusing primarily on the physics aspects of the new research thrusts, in which liquid crystals - thermotropic as well as lyotropic - often meet other types of soft matter, such as polymers and colloidal nano- or microparticle dispersions. Because the field is of large interest also for researchers without a liquid crystal background we begin with a concise introduction to the liquid crystalline state of matter and the key concepts of the research field. We then discuss a selection of promising new directions, starting with liquid crystals for organic electronics, followed by nanotemplating and nanoparticle organization using liquid crystals, liquid crystal colloids (where the liquid crystal can constitute either the continuous phase or the disperse phase, as droplets or shells) and their potential in e.g. photonics and metamaterials, liquid crystal-functionalized polymer fibers, liquid crystal elastomer actuators, ending with a brief overview of activities focusing on liquid crystals in biology, food science and pharmacology.

It can be particularly severe in transplant recipients that have a current or a previous coccidioidal infection. Fatal case of coccidioidomycosis has been described in this group of patients.Aims: We report a severe case of pneumonia caused by C. posadassi in a 29 year-old white woman that had been admitted to hospital as part of the evaluation for bilateral lung transplantation. The patient was a native and resident of Catamarca, Argentina. Molecular methodologies contributed to the species identification.Methods: Clinical, laboratory records and microbiological tests were carried out to diagnose the infection and to identify C. posadasii.Results: A fungus was isolated from BAL culture. Phenotypic characterization, specific PCR and experimental animal inoculation demonstrated the presence of C. posadasii. The patent responded well to amphotericin B deoxycholate.

Results are often visualized as a two-dimensional scatter or contour plot. Because these plots can be relatively diffuse, it is not always straightforward to discern a relationship between measured parameters. We have demonstrated that quantitative trends can be fit to the single-cell data generated from a heterogeneous population. We engineered Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells to express a broad range of oncogenic Ras levels. Instead of individual cultures with individual expression levels, a continuous range of levels was expressed by different cells in one heterogeneous culture. We then stained cells for downstream Erk phosphorylation to monitor MAPK signaling or employed an E2F-responsive genetic reporter to monitor cell-cycle activity. Subsequent analysis by flow cytometry and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) revealed that increasing Ras oncogene expression led to increasing MAPK signaling. In contrast, E2F activity peaked at an optimal, intermediate level of Ras. To make this analytical method widely available to others, we have provided a software application that performs LOWESS on any two-parameter population data collected by flow cytometry.

Previous analyses of their transcriptional regulatory networks have shown that they exhibit high plasticity during evolution and suggested that both converge to scale-free-like structures. Nevertheless, beyond this suggestion, no analyses have been carried out to identify the common systems-level components and principles governing these organisms. Here we show that these two phylogenetically distant organisms follow a set of common novel biologically consistent systems principles revealed by the mathematically and biologically founded natural decomposition approach. The discovered common functional architecture is a diamond-shaped, matryoshka-like, three-layer (coordination, processing, and integration) hierarchy exhibiting feedback, which is shaped by four systems-level components: global transcription factors (global TFs), locally autonomous modules, basal machinery and intermodular genes. The first mathematical criterion to identify global TFs, the kappa-value, was reassessed on B. subtilis and confirmed its high predictive power by identifying all the previously reported, plus three potential, master regulators and eight sigma factors. The functionally conserved cores of modules, basal cell machinery, and a set of non-orthologous common physiological global responses were identified via both orthologous genes and non-orthologous conserved functions. This study reveals novel common systems principles maintained between two phylogenetically distant organisms and provides a comparison of their lifestyle adaptations.

Languages variously employ tones, clicks, or manual signs to signal differences in meaning; some languages lack the noun-verb distinction (e.g., Straits Salish), whereas others have a proliferation of fine-grained syntactic categories (e.g., Tzeltal); and some languages do without morphology (e.g., Mandarin), while others pack a whole sentence into a single word (e.g., Cayuga). A challenge for evolutionary biology is to reconcile the diversity of languages with the high degree of biological uniformity of their speakers. Here, we model processes of language change and geographical dispersion and find a consistent pressure for flexible learning, irrespective of the language being spoken. This pressure arises because flexible learners can best cope with the observed high rates of linguistic change associated with divergent cultural evolution following human migration. Thus, rather than genetic adaptations for specific aspects of language, such as recursion, the coevolution of genes and fast-changing linguistic structure provides the biological basis for linguistic diversity. Only biological adaptations for flexible learning combined with cultural evolution can explain how each child has the potential to learn any human language.

In this study, we developed a delayed mathematical model to describe the virus-induced interferon (IFN) signaling process by considering several key players in the innate immune response. Using dynamic analysis and numerical simulation, we evaluated the following predictions regarding the antiviral responses: (1) When the replication ratio of virus is less than 1, the infectious virus will be eliminated by the immune system's defenses regardless of how the time delays are changed. (2) The IFN positive feedback regulation enhances the stability of the innate immune response and causes the immune system to present the bistability phenomenon. (3) The appropriate duration of viral replication and IFN feedback processes stabilizes the innate immune response. The predictions from the model were confirmed by monitoring the virus titer and IFN expression in infected cells. The results suggest that the balance between viral replication and IFN-induced feedback regulation coordinates the dynamical behavior of virus-triggered signaling and antiviral responses. This work will help clarify the mechanisms of the virus-induced innate immune response at a system level and provide instruction for further biological experiments.

Thermal and Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) induced unfolding of a variant of GFP, without the chromophore, occurs in an apparent two-state manner. The calculated midpoint of the equilibrium folding in GdmCl, taken into account using the Molecular Transfer Model (MTM), is in excellent agreement with the experiments. The melting temperatures decrease linearly as the concentrations of GdmCl and urea are increased. The structural features of rarely populated equilibrium intermediates, visible only in free energy profiles projected along a few order parameters, are remarkably similar to those identified in a number of ensemble experiments in GFP with the chromophore. The excellent agreement between simulations and experiments show that the equilibrium intermediates are stabilized by the chromophore. Folding kinetics, upon temperature quench, show that GFP first collapses and populates an ensemble of compact structures. Despite the seeming simplicity of the equilibrium folding, flux to the native state flows through multiple channels and can be described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism. Detailed analysis of the folding trajectories show that both equilibrium and several kinetic intermediates, including misfolded structures, are sampled during folding. Interestingly, the intermediates characterized in the simulations coincide with those identified in single molecule pulling experiments. Our predictions, amenable to experimental tests, show that MTM is a practical way to simulate the effect of denaturants on the folding of large proteins.

Broader adoption of microbial synthesis is hampered by a limited number of high-yielding natural pathways for molecules with the desired physical properties, as well as the difficulty in functionally assembling complex bio-synthetic pathways in heterologous hosts. Here, we address both of these challenges by reporting the adaptation of the butanol bio-synthetic pathway for the synthesis of odd-chain molecules and the development of a complementary modular toolkit to facilitate pathway construction, characterization, and optimization in engineered Escherichia coli. The modular feature of our pathway enables multi-entry and multiexit biosynthesis of various odd-chain compounds at high efficiency. By varying combinations of the pathway and toolkit enzymes, we demonstrate controlled production of propionate, trans-2-pentenoate, valerate, and pentanol, compounds with applications that include biofuels, antibiotics, biopolymers, and aroma chemicals. Importantly, and in contrast to a previously used method to identify limitations in heterologous amorphadiene production, our bypass strategy was effective even without the presence of freely membrane-diffusible substrates. This approach should prove useful for optimization of other pathways that use CoA-derivatized intermediates, including fatty acid beta-oxidation and the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid synthesis.

Biological systems composed of modular parts with clearly defined interactions are generally easier to manipulate than complex systems exhibiting a large number of subtle interactions. However, recreating the function of a naturally complex system with simple modular parts can increase fragility. Here, inspired by scaffold-directed signaling in higher organisms, we modularize prokaryotic signal transduction to allow programmable redirection of phosphate flux from a histidine kinase to response regulators based on targeting by eukaryotic protein-protein interaction domains. Although scaffold-directed colocalization alone was sufficient to direct signaling between components, this minimal system suffered from high sensitivity to changing expression levels of each component. To address this fragility, we demonstrate how to engineer autoinhibition into the kinase so that phosphotransfer is possible only upon binding to the scaffold. This system, in which scaffold performs the dual functions of activating this autoinhibited kinase and directing flux to the cotargeted response regulator, was significantly more robust to varying component concentrations. Thus, we demonstrate that design principles inspired by the complex signal-transduction pathways of eukaryotes may be generalized, abstracted, and applied to prokaryotes using well-characterized parts.

However, direct proof of a population of stem cells in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains elusive. In this study, we enriched for stem-like cells from the SCLC cell line H446 by growing them as spheres in a defined serum-free medium. Sphere-derived cells have increased in vitro clonogenic and in vivo tumorigenic potentials as well as drug-resistant properties. After enrichment for stem-like cells, we used multiple candidate stem cell markers to examine the expression profile and found that the sphere-derived cells contained a higher proportion of cells expressing the stem cell surface markers uPAR and CD133 when compared with parental cells. To identify a selectable marker for the sphere-forming cells, we evaluated the sphere-forming abilities of uPAR(+) and uPAR(-) cells as well as the sphere-forming abilities of CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells. Both CD133(+) and CD133(-) cell fractions were capable of forming spheres, and no statistically significant difference was observed in the sphere-forming efficiency between these two populations. In contrast, cells derived from the uPAR(+) fraction were capable of forming spheres, whereas cells derived from the uPAR(-) fraction remained as single cells. Moreover, uPAR(+) cells efficiently formed transplantable tumors, whereas uPAR(-) cells were unable to initiate tumors when transplanted at equivalent cell numbers. In addition, uPAR(+) cells could differentiate into CD56(+) cells. CK+ cells, and uPAR(-) cells. These data support the existence of a population of tumor sphere-forming cells with stem cell properties in the H446 SCLC cell line. Furthermore, the stem cell population may be enriched in cells expressing the uPAR cell surface marker. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exit from prophase I is controlled by the recombination checkpoint (RC), which, in yeast, represses the meiosis-specific transcription factor Ndt80 required for the expression of B-type cyclins and other M phase regulators. We show that an extended prophase I additionally requires the suppression of latent, mitotic cell-cycle controls by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and its meiosis-specific activator Ama1, which trigger the degradation of M phase regulators and Ndd1, a subunit of a mitotic transcription factor. ama1 Delta mutants exit from prophase I prematurely and independently of the RC, which results in recombination defects and chromosome missegregation. Thus, control of prophase I by meiotic mechanisms depends on the suppression of the alternative, mitotic mechanisms by a meiosis-specific form of the APC/C.

We found minimal clinical differences between IL-6(+)S TEMI and IL-6(-)STEMI. We assessed the inflammatory profiles of the 2 STEMI groups and the controls by measuring 18 cytokines in blood samples. We exploited clustering analysis algorithms to infer the functional modules of interacting cytokines. IL-6(+) STEMI patients were characterized by the activation of 2 modules of interacting signals comprising IL-10, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and monokine induced by interferon-gamma. IL-10 was increased both in IL-6+ STEMI and IL-6(-) STEMI patients compared with controls. IL-6(+)IL-10(+) STEMI patients had an increased risk of systolic dysfunction at discharge and an increased risk of death at 6 months in comparison with IL-6(-)IL-10(+) STEMI patients. We combined IL-10 and monokine induced by interferon-gamma (derived from the 2 identified cytokine modules) with IL-6 in a formula yielding a risk index that outperformed any single cytokine in the prediction of systolic dysfunction and death.Conclusions: We have identified a characteristic circulating inflammatory cytokine pattern in STEMI patients, which is not related to the extent of myocardial damage. The simultaneous elevation of IL-6 and IL-10 levels distinguishes STEMI patients with worse clinical outcomes from other STEMI patients.

Until recently, it was thought that these regulatory networks are composed solely of protein-mediated transcriptional control and signaling systems; consequently, it was thought that cardiac disease involves perturbation of these systems. However, it is becoming evident that RNA, long considered to function primarily as the platform for protein production, may in fact play a major role in most, if not all, aspects of gene regulation, especially the epigenetic processes that underpin organogenesis. These include not only well-validated classes of regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs, but also tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed across the entire genome of humans and other animals.

Cardiovascular effects of ErbB2-targeted cancer therapies provide evidence in humans that ErbB signaling plays a role in the maintenance of cardiac function. These and other studies suggest a conceptual model in which a key function of NRG-1/ErbB signaling is to mediate adaptations of the heart to physiological and pathological stimuli through activation of intracellular kinase cascades that regulate tissue plasticity.

It is now clear that a GPCR coupling to these pathways can be regulated selectively by ligands that differentially drive signaling down one pathway in preference to another. This concept, termed stimulus bias, is revolutionizing receptor biology and drug discovery by providing a means of selectively targeting receptor signaling pathways that have therapeutic impact. Herein, we utilized a novel quantitative method that determines stimulus bias of synthetic GPCR ligands in a manner that nullifies the impact of both the cellular background and the ""natural bias"" of the endogenous ligand. By applying this method to the M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical GPCR, we found that mutation of key residues (Tyr-802.61 and Trp-993.28) in an allosteric binding pocket introduces stimulus bias in response to the atypical ligands AC-42 (4-n-butyl-1-(4-(2-methylphenyl)-4-oxo-1-butyl) piperidine HCl) and 77-LH-28-1 (1-(3-(4-butyl-1-piperidinyl) propyl)-3,3-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone). By comparing stimulus bias factors among receptor internalization, G protein activation, extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, and receptor phosphorylation, we provide evidence that Tyr-802.61 and Trp-993.28 act either as molecular switches or as gatekeeper residues that introduce constraints limiting the active conformation of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and thereby regulate stimulus bias. Furthermore, we provide evidence that downstream signaling pathways previously considered to be related to each other (i.e. receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and activation of ERK1/2) can act independently.

APRIL binds two different TNF receptors, B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and cylclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), and also interacts independently with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Because APRIL shares binding of the TNF receptors with B cell activation factor, separating the precise signaling pathways activated by either ligand in a given context has proven quite difficult.

However, the optimal cell type and the easy reprogramming approaches that minimize genetic aberrations of parent cells must be considered before generating the iPSCs. This paper reports a method to generate iPSCs from adult human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) without the use of a feeder layer, by ectopic expression of the defined transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC using a polycistronic plasmid. The results, based on the expression of pluripotent marker, demonstrated that the iPSCs have the characteristics similar to those of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The iPSCs differentiated into three embryonic germ layers both in vitro by embryoid body generation and in vivo by teratoma formation after being injected into immunodeficient mice. More importantly, the plasmid DNA does not integrate into the genome of human iPSCs as revealed by Southern blotting experiments. Karyotypic analysis also demonstrated that the reprogramming of hADSCs by the defined factors did not induce chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, this technology provides a platform for studying the biology of iPSCs without viral vectors, and can hopefully overcome immune rejection and ethical concerns, which are the two important barriers of ESC applications.

While regulators of certain aspects of steroidogenesis are known, the initial driver of steroidogenesis in the human and rodent fetal testis is unclear. Through comparative analysis of rodent fetal testis microarray datasets, 54 candidate fetal Leydig cell-specific genes were identified. Fetal mouse testis interstitial expression of a subset of these genes with unknown expression (Crhr1, Gramd1b, Itih5, Vgll3, and Vsnl1) was verified by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Among the candidate fetal Leydig cell-specific factors, three receptors (CRHR1, PRLR, and PROKR2) were tested for a steroidogenic function using ex vivo fetal testes treated with receptor agonists (CRH, PRL, and PROK2). While PRL and PROK2 had no effect, CRH, at low (approximately 1 to 10) nM concentration, increased expression of the steroidogenic genes Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Scarb1, and Star in GD15 mouse and GD17 rat testes, and in conjunction, testosterone production was increased. Exposure of GD15 fetal mouse testis to a specific CRHR1 antagonist blunted the CRH-induced steroidogenic gene expression and testosterone responses. Similar to ex vivo rodent fetal testes, >= 10 nM CRH exposure of MA-10 Leydig cells increased steroidogenic pathway mRNA and progesterone levels, showing CRH can enhance steroidogenesis by directly targeting Leydig cells.

Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification(3), as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems(4). A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)(5,6). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages(7-9). Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.

NPM1 is preferentially localized in the nucleoli of normal cells, whereas it is also present at the nuclear matrix in cancer cells. However, the biological roles of NPM1 during infection are unknown. Here, by analyzing a pV-deletion mutant, Ad5-dV/TSB, we demonstrate that pV promotes the NPM1 translocation from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm in normal cells, and the NPM1 translocation is correlated with adenoviral replication. Lack of pV causes a dramatic reduction of adenoviral replication in normal cells, but not cancer cells, and Ad5-dV/TSB was defective in viral assembly in normal cells. NPM1 knockdown inhibits adenoviral replication, suggesting an involvement of NPM1 in adenoviral biology. Further, we show that NPM1 interacts with empty adenovirus particles which are an intermediate during virion maturation by immunoelectron microscopy. Collectively, these data implicate that pV participates in a process of viral assembly through NPM1. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Yet, genome annotation, comparison, and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge, hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains >5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users.

It activates Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt and STAT activation pathways. These are the main pathways for cell proliferation and survival. We have developed two mathematical models to relate to the different EGFR signaling in NSCLC and normal cells in the presence or absence of EGFR and PTEN mutations. The dynamics of downstream signaling pathways vary in the disease state and activation of some factors can be indicative of drug resistance. Our simulation denotes the effect of EGFR mutations and increased expression of certain factors in NSCLC EGFR signaling on each of the three pathways where levels of pERK, pSTAT and pAkt are increased. Over activation of ERK, Akt and STAT3 which are the main cell proliferation and survival factors act as promoting factors for tumor progression in NSCLC. In case of loss of PTEN, Akt activity level is considerably increased. Our simulation results show that in the presence of erlotinib, downstream factors i.e. pAkt, pSTAT3 and pERK are inhibited. However, in case of loss of PTEN expression in the presence of erlotinib, pAkt level would not decrease which demonstrates that these cells are resistant to erlotinib.

The mechanisms that regulate this rearrangement in vivo are poorly understood - largely because of the difficulty to visualize filamentous actin (F-actin) structures with sufficient resolution. Here, we use transgenic mice expressing Lifeact-EGFP to visualize F-actin in ECs. We show that in the retina, Lifeact-EGFP expression is largely restricted to ECs allowing detailed visualization of F-actin in ECs in situ. Lifeact-EGFP labels actin associated with cell-cell junctions, apical and basal membranes and highlights actin-based structures such as filopodia and stress fiber-like cytoplasmic bundles. We also show that in the skin and the skeletal muscle, Lifeact-EGFP is highly expressed in vascular mural cells (vMCs), enabling vMC imaging. In summary, our results indicate that the Lifeact-EGFP transgenic mouse in combination with the postnatal retinal angiogenic model constitutes an excellent system for vascular cell biology research. Our approach is ideally suited to address structural and mechanistic details of angiogenic processes, such as endothelial tip cell migration and fusion, EC polarization or lumen formation.

The molecular events underlying axon degeneration are poorly understood. We have developed a novel method to enrich for axoplasm from rodent optic nerve and characterised the early events in Wallerian degeneration using an unbiased proteomics screen. Our detergent-free method draws axoplasm into a dehydrated hydrogel of the polymer poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), which is then recovered using centrifugation. This technique is able to recover axonal proteins and significantly deplete glial contamination as confirmed by immunoblotting. We have used iTRAQ to compare axoplasm-enriched samples from naive vs injured optic nerves, which has revealed a pronounced modulation of proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton. To confirm the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton in injured axons we focused on the RhoA pathway. Western blotting revealed an augmentation of RhoA and phosphorylated cofilin in axoplasm-enriched samples from injured optic nerve. To investigate the localisation of these components of the RhoA pathway in injured axons we transected axons of primary hippocampal neurons in vitro. We observed an early modulation of filamentous actin with a concomitant redistribution of phosphorylated cofilin in injured axons. At later time-points, RhoA is found to accumulate in axonal swellings and also colocalises with filamentous actin. The actin cytoskeleton is a known sensor of cell viability across multiple eukaryotes, and our results suggest a similar role for the actin cytoskeleton following axon injury. In agreement with other reports, our data also highlights the role of the RhoA pathway in axon degeneration. These findings highlight a previously unexplored area of axon biology, which may open novel avenues to prevent axon degeneration. Our method for isolating CNS axoplasm also represents a new tool to study axon biology.

To gain insights into the global relationship between drugs and their affected metabolic subpathways, we constructed a drug-metabolic subpathway network (DRSN). This network included 3925 significant drug-metabolic subpathway associations representing drug dual effects. Through analyses based on network biology, we found that if drugs were linked to the same subpathways in the DRSN, they tended to share the same indications and side effects. Furthermore, if drugs shared more subpathways, they tended to share more side effects. We then calculated the association score by integrating drug-affected subpathways and disease-related subpathways to quantify the extent of the associations between each drug class and disease class. The results showed some close drugdisease associations such as sex hormone drugs and cancer suggesting drug dual effects. Surprisingly, most drugs displayed close associations with their side effects rather than their indications. To further investigate the mechanism of drug dual effects, we classified all the subpathways in the DRSN into therapeutic and non-therapeutic subpathways representing drug therapeutic effects and side effects. Compared to drug side effects, the therapeutic effects tended to work through tissuespecific genes and these genes tend to be expressed in the adrenal gland, liver and kidney; while drug side effects always occurred in the liver, bone marrow and trachea. Taken together, the DRSN could provide great insights into understanding the global relationship between drugs and metabolic subpathways.

It was recently demonstrated that Borrelia burgdorferi aggregate formation dramatically changes the in vitro response to hostile environments by this pathogen. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that these aggregates are indeed biofilms, structures whose resistance to unfavorable conditions are well documented. We studied Borrelia burgdorferi for several known hallmark features of biofilm, including structural rearrangements in the aggregates, variations in development on various substrate matrices and secretion of a protective extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix using several modes of microscopic, cell and molecular biology techniques. The atomic force microscopic results provided evidence that multilevel rearrangements take place at different stages of aggregate development, producing a complex, continuously rearranging structure. Our results also demonstrated that Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of developing aggregates on different abiotic and biotic substrates, and is also capable of forming floating aggregates. Analyzing the extracellular substance of the aggregates for potential exopolysaccharides revealed the existence of both sulfated and nonsulfated/carboxylated substrates, predominately composed of an alginate with calcium and extracellular DNA present. In summary, we have found substantial evidence that Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of forming biofilm in vitro. Biofilm formation by Borrelia species might play an important role in their survival in diverse environmental conditions by providing refuge to individual cells.

Molecular biology research about this honey bee species is scarce, and genomic information for A. c. cerana is not currently available. Transcriptome and expression profiling data for this species are therefore important resources needed to better understand the biological mechanisms of A. c. cerana. In this study, we obtained the transcriptome information of A. c. cerana by RNA-sequencing and compared gene expression differences between queens and workers of A. c. cerana by digital gene expression (DGE) analysis.Results: Using high-throughput Illumina RNA sequencing we obtained 51,581,510 clean reads corresponding to 4.64 Gb total nucleotides from a single run. These reads were assembled into 46,999 unigenes with a mean length of 676 bp. Based on a sequence similarity search against the five public databases (NR, Swissport, GO, COG, KEGG) with a cut-off E-value of 10 25 using BLASTX, a total of 24,630 unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology terms, or metabolic pathways. Using these transcriptome data as references we analyzed the gene expression differences between the queens and workers of A. c. cerana using a tag-based digital gene expression method. We obtained 5.96 and 5.66 million clean tags from the queen and worker samples, respectively.

Lotka provided fundamental formulations for population modeling; less appreciated are his explorations of the underlying material (elemental) basis of life and its implications for ecology and evolution. This paper describes recent developments in ecological and biological stoichiometry that unify these aspects of Lotka's work. Stoichiometrically explicit versions of the Lotka-Volterra equations capture key missing aspects of food web interactions, such as the effects of food quality and nutrient recycling feedbacks, and encompass a richer, and potentially more realistic, set of dynamics than non-stoichiometric models. These stoichiometric models are now being further extended to include the recently discovered effects of excess dietary nutrient content on consumer performance. The multidimensional capacity of stoichiometric models is likely to be of particular value given the pressing need to anticipate the ecological effects of globally dynamic perturbations of multiple chemical elements (e.g. C, N, and P) due to human actions.

Although numerous habitat suitability models have been developed based on ecological data, data quality is often a key, but overlooked issue in the development of such models. This paper analysed the impact of sampling efficiency on the quality of data-driven habitat suitability models. Therefore, models were derived from fish habitat data obtained from two sampling techniques with contrasting efficiency: electrofishing and radio telemetry. Specifically, we developed habitat models for burbot (Lota Iota L) in the River Grote Nete based on radio telemetry data and electrofishing data and compared the performance and ecological relevance of these models. Although both electrofishing and telemetry models selected the presence of hollow banks as the most important input variable, the telemetry models performed substantially better than the electrofishing models. Further, the telemetry models also better reflected the observed burbot habitat preferences within the study area. These telemetry models indicated that burbot prefers hollow banks and that depth and flow velocity conditions in the study area were not limiting for burbot. The presented approach may contribute to the development of more reliable and ecologically relevant habitat suitability models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this report, we show evidence that the iminosugar DGJNAc can inhibit, stabilize, and chaperone human alpha-NAGAL both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that a related iminosugar DGJ (currently in phase III clinical trials for another metabolic disorder, Fabry disease) can also chaperone human alpha-NAGAL in Schindler/Kanzaki disease. The 1.4- and 1.5-angstrom crystal structures of human alpha-NAGAL complexes reveal the different binding modes of iminosugars compared with glycosides. We show how differences in two functional groups result in >9 kcal/mol of additional binding energy and explain the molecular interactions responsible for the unexpectedly high affinity of the pharmacological chaperones.

In Escherichia coli, pimelate is made by bypassing the strict specificity of the fatty acid synthetic pathway. BioC methylates the free carboxyl of a malonyl thioester, which replaces the usual acetyl thioester primer. This atypical primer is transformed to pimeloyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) methyl ester by two cycles of fatty acid synthesis. The question is, what stops this product from undergoing further elongation? Although BioH readily cleaves this product in vitro, the enzyme is nonspecific, which made assignment of its physiological substrate problematical, especially because another enzyme, BioF, could also perform this gatekeeping function. We report the 2.05-angstrom resolution cocrystal structure of a complex of BioH with pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester and use the structure to demonstrate that BioH is the gatekeeper and its physiological substrate is pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester.

In contrast, efficient natural utilization of -2 PRF has not been demonstrated previously in eukaryotic systems. Like all nidoviruses, members of the Arteriviridae (a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses) express their replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab from two long ORFs (1a and 1b), where synthesis of pp1ab depends on -1 PRF. These polyproteins are posttranslationally cleaved into at least 13 functional nonstructural proteins. Here we report that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and apparently most other arteriviruses, use an additional PRF mechanism to access a conserved alternative ORF that overlaps the nsp2-encoding region of ORF1a in the + 1 frame. We show here that this ORF is translated via -2 PRF at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence (underscores separate ORF1a codons) at an estimated efficiency of around 20%, yielding a transframe fusion (nsp2TF) with the N-terminal two thirds of nsp2. Expression of nsp2TF in PRRSV-infected cells was verified using specific Abs, and the site and direction of frameshifting were determined via mass spectrometric analysis of nsp2TF. Further, mutagenesis showed that the frame-shift site and an unusual frameshift-stimulatory element (a conserved CCCANCUCC motif 11 nucleotides downstream) are required to direct efficient -2 PRF. Mutations preventing nsp2TF expression impair PRRSV replication and produce a small-plaque phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that -2 PRF is a functional gene-expression mechanism in eukaryotes and add another layer to the complexity of arterivirus genome expression.

However, phosphotyrosine accounts for less than 1% of all phosphorylated substrates, and it is typically a very transient event in vivo. These factors complicate the identification of key tyrosine kinase substrates, especially in the context of their extraordinary spatial organization. Here, we describe an approach to identify tyrosine kinase substrates based on their subcellular distribution from within cells. This method uses an unnatural amino acid-modified Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that is expressed within cells and can covalently trap phosphotyrosine proteins on exposure to light. This SH2 domain-based photoprobe was targeted to cellular structures, such as the actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and cellular membranes, to capture tyrosine kinase substrates unique to each cellular region. We demonstrate that RhoA, one of the proteins associated with actin, can be phosphorylated on two tyrosine residues within the switch regions, suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues might modulate RhoA signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. We conclude that expression of SH2 domains within cellular compartments that are capable of covalent phototrapping can reveal the spatial organization of tyrosine kinase substrates that are likely to be important for the regulation of subcellular structures.

Elucidation of the biological mechanisms underlying these effects is an area of considerable interest and investigation, and it is important to determine whether these mechanisms are distinct for different health outcomes or whether there are some common underlying pathways that may account for the effects of disparate prenatal and early postnatal conditions on various health and disease risk phenotypes. We propose that telomere biology may represent a common underlying mechanism connecting fetal programming and subsequent health outcomes. It appears that the initial establishment of telomere length and regulation of telomere homeostasis may be plastic and receptive to the influence of intrauterine and other early life conditions. Moreover, telomere homeostasis in various cell types may serve as a fundamental integrator and regulator of processes underlying cell genomic integrity and function, aging, and senescence over the life span. We advance the hypothesis that context-and time-inappropriate exposures to various forms of physiological stress (maternal-placental-fetal endocrine aberrations and immune, inflammatory, and oxidative stresses) during the intrauterine period of development may alter or program the telomere biology system in a manner that accelerates cellular dysfunction, aging, and disease susceptibility over the life span.

Despite its potentially broad influence in tumour biology and prevalent expression, the value of MIF as a therapeutic target in cancer remains unclear. We sought to validate MIF in tumour models by achieving a complete inhibition of its expression in tumour cells and in the tumour stroma.METHODS: We used MIF shRNA-transduced B16-F10 melanoma cells implanted in wild-type and MIF-/- C57Bl6 mice to investigate the effect of loss of MIF on tumour growth. Cytokine detection and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to evaluate tumours ex vivo.RESULTS: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor shRNA inhibited expression of MIF protein by B16-F10 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the loss of MIF in this cell line resulted in a decreased response to hypoxia as indicated by reduced expression of VEGF. In vivo the growth of B16-F10 tumours was inhibited by an average of 47% in the MIF-/- mice compared with wild-type but was unaffected by loss of MIF expression by the tumour cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that microvessel density was decreased in tumours implanted in the MIF-/- mice. Profiling of serum cytokines showed a decrease in pro-angiogenic cytokines in MIF-/- mice.CONCLUSION: We report that the absence of MIF in the host resulted in slower tumour growth, which was associated with reduced vascularity. While the major contribution of MIF appeared to be in the regulation of angiogenesis, tumour cell-derived MIF played a negligible role in this process.

While it is accepted that in many cases cilia are mainly coupled together by the hydrodynamic velocity field, a clear understanding of which aspects determine the collective wave properties is lacking. It is a difficult problem, because both the behavior of the individual cilia and their coupling together are nonlinear. In this work, we coarse-grain the degrees of freedom of each cilium into a minimal description in terms of a configuration-based phase oscillator. Driving colloidal particles with optical tweezers, we then experimentally investigate the coupling through hydrodynamics in systems of many oscillators, showing that a collective dynamics emerges. This work generalizes to a wider class of systems our recent finding that the non-equilibrium steady state can be understood based on the equilibrium properties of the system, i.e. the positions and orientations of the active oscillators. In this model system, it is possible to design configurations of oscillators with the desired collective dynamics. The other face of this problem is to relate the collective patterns found in biology to the architecture and behavior of individual active elements.

Inbreeding depression is commonly observed in animals and plants. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to genetic processes, epigenetic processes may play an important role in causing inbreeding effects. We compared epigenetic markers of outbred and inbred offspring of the perennial plant Scabiosa columbaria and found that inbreeding increases DNA methylation. Moreover, we found that inbreeding depression disappears when epigenetic variation is modified by treatment with a demethylation agent, linking inbreeding depression firmly to epigenetic variation.

We compared population differentiation (phi'(ST) and F-ST) for the stripes locus-which underlies this colour pattern polymorphism-with neutral microsatellite loci to test for a signature of selection among native and introduced populations. Among native populations, phi'(ST) and F-ST for stripes were lower than expected under the neutral model, suggesting uniform balancing selection. Alternatively, among introduced populations, phi'(ST) and F-ST for stripes did not differ from the neutral model. These results suggest that the evolutionary dynamics of this previously adaptive trait have become dominated by random genetic drift following the range expansion.

It has been proposed that F-420 has an important role in the oxidoreductive reactions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, possibly associated with anaerobic survival and persistence. The protein encoded by Rv0132c has a predicted N-terminal signal sequence and is annotated as an F-420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Here we show that Rv0132c protein does not have the annotated activity. It does, however, co-purify with F-420 during expression experiments in M. smegmatis. We also show that the Rv0132c-F-420 complex is a substrate for the Tat pathway, which mediates translocation of the complex across the cytoplasmic membrane, where Rv0132c is anchored to the cell envelope. This is the first report of any F-420-binding protein being a substrate for the Tat pathway and of the presence of F-420 outside of the cytosol in any F-420-producing microorganism. The Rv0132c protein and its Tat export sequence are essentially invariant in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.

Considering an ensemble of independent motions governed by common Markov dynamics, we establish that the entire ensemble attains Poissonian steady states which are quantified by stationary Poissonian intensities and which hold valid also in the case of nonstationary Markov dynamics. The methodology is applied to a host of Markov dynamics, including Brownian motion, birth-death processes, random walks, geometric random walks, renewal processes, growth-collapse dynamics, decay-surge dynamics, Ito diffusions, and Langevin dynamics.

As immunity is a predictor of coral disease and thermal stress susceptibility, a comprehensive understanding of this new field will likely provide amechanistic explanation for ecological-scale trends in reef declines. Recently, several strides within coral immunology document defence mechanisms that are consistent with those of both invertebrates and vertebrates, and which span the recognition, signalling and effector response phases of innate immunity. However, many of these studies remain discrete and unincorporated into the wider fields of invertebrate immunology or coral biology. To encourage the rapid development of coral immunology, we comprehensively synthesize the current understanding of the field in the context of general invertebrate immunology, and highlight fundamental gaps in our knowledge. We propose a framework for future research that we hope will stimulate directional studies in this emerging field and lead to the elucidation of an integrated network of coral immune mechanisms. Once established, we are optimistic that coral immunology can be effectively applied to pertinent ecological questions, improve current prediction tools and aid conservation efforts.

The mutation identified in his blood and buccal cells, c.1771delG, p.Asp591Ilefs*25, appears to be a de novo event, as it was not transmitted by either of his parents. This type of de novo event is rare in MLH1 as only three cases have been reported in the literature so far. Furthermore, the discordant results observed between replication error phenotyping and immunohistochemistry highlight the importance of the systematic use of both pre-screening tests in the molecular diagnosis of Lynch syndrome.

The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry consortium provides a repository of life-science ontologies, which are developed according to a set of shared principles. This consortium has developed an ontology called OBO Relation Ontology aiming at standardizing the different types of biological entity classes and associated relationships. Since ontologies are primarily intended to be used by humans, the use of graphical notations for ontology development facilitates the capture, comprehension and communication of knowledge between its users. However, OBO Foundry ontologies are captured and represented basically using text-based notations. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides a standard and widely-used graphical notation for modeling computer systems. UML provides a well-defined set of modeling elements, which can be extended using a built-in extension mechanism named Profile. Thus, this work aims at developing a UML profile for the OBO Relation Ontology to provide a domain-specific set of modeling elements that can be used to create standard UML-based ontologies in the biomedical domain.Results: We have studied the OBO Relation Ontology, the UML metamodel and the UML profiling mechanism. Based on these studies, we have proposed an extension to the UML metamodel in conformance with the OBO Relation Ontology and we have defined a profile that implements the extended metamodel. Finally, we have applied the proposed UML profile in the development of a number of fragments from different ontologies. Particularly, we have considered the Gene Ontology (GO), the PRotein Ontology (PRO) and the Xenopus Anatomy and Development Ontology (XAO).Conclusions: The use of an established and well-known graphical language in the development of biomedical ontologies provides a more intuitive form of capturing and representing knowledge than using only text-based notations. The use of the profile requires the domain expert to reason about the underlying semantics of the concepts and relationships being modeled, which helps preventing the introduction of inconsistencies in an ontology under development and facilitates the identification and correction of errors in an already defined ontology.

Nowadays it is becoming clearer that the complexity of organisms is more related with the organization of its components in networks rather than with the individual behaviour of the components. Among various approaches for inferring networks, Bayesian Networks are very attractive due to their probabilistic nature and flexibility to incorporate interventions and extra sources of information. Recently various attempts to infer networks with different Bayesian Networks approaches were pursued. The specific interest in this paper is to compare the performance of three different inference approaches: Bayesian Networks without any modification; Bayesian Networks modified to take into account specific interventions produced during data collection; and a probabilistic hierarchical model that allows the inclusion of extra knowledge in the inference of Bayesian Networks. The inference is performed in three different types of data: (i) synthetic data obtained from a Gaussian distribution, (ii) synthetic data simulated with Netbuilder and (iii) Real data obtained in flow cytometry experiments.Results: Bayesian Networks with interventions and Bayesian Networks with inclusion of extra knowledge outperform simple Bayesian Networks in all data sets when considering the reconstruction accuracy and taking the edge directions into account. In the Real data the increase in accuracy is also observed when not taking the edge directions into account.Conclusions: Although it comes with a small extra computational cost the use of more refined Bayesian network models is justified. Both the inclusion of extra knowledge and the use of interventions have outperformed the simple Bayesian network model in simulated and Real data sets. Also, if the source of extra knowledge used in the inference is not reliable the inferred network is not deteriorated. If the extra knowledge has a good agreement with the data there is no significant difference in using the Bayesian networks with interventions or Bayesian networks with the extra knowledge.

To investigate the physiological function of GPR116 in vivo, we generated adipose tissue specific conditional Gpr116 knockout mice (CKO) and fed them on standard chow or high fat diets. Selective deletion of Gpr116 in adipose tissue caused a pronounced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice, especially when challenged with a high fat diet. Biochemical analysis revealed a more severe hepatosteatosis in CKO mice. Additionally, we found that CKO mice showed a lowered concentration of circulating adiponectin and an increased level of serum resistin. Our study suggests that GPR116 may play a critical role in controlling adipocyte biology and systemic energy homeostasis. (C) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The homologous scaffold was detected by an in silica analysis that established the spatial and electrostatic congruence of the active site of a Class B2 CphA metallo-beta-lactamase from Aeromonas hydrophila to the active site of VAP. The tested beta-lactam compounds did not inhibit Escherichia coil or shrimp alkaline phosphatase, which could be ascribed to the lower congruence indicated by CLASP. There was no discernible beta-lactamase activity in the tested alkaline phosphatases. This is the first time a scaffold recognizing imipenem in an alkaline phosphatase (VAP) has been demonstrated.

Cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells is a prominent and ubiquitous example, in which cargo-carrying molecular motors move along polymer filaments and generate coherent cell-scale flow. When filaments are not fixed to the cell periphery, a situation found both in vivo and in vitro, we observe that the basic dynamics of streaming are closely related to those of a nonmotile stresslet suspension. Under this model, it is demonstrated that confinement makes possible a stable circulating state; a linear stability analysis reveals an activity threshold for spontaneous autocirculation.

Lipids and proteins play cooperative roles in the fusion process, which is triggered by the acidic pH inside the endosome. This acidic environment induces many changes in glycoprotein conformation and allows the action of a highly conserved hydrophobic sequence, the fusion peptide (FP). Despite the large volume of information available on the virus-triggered fusion process, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind flavivirus-cell membrane fusion. Here, we evaluated the contribution of a natural single amino acid difference on two flavivirus FPs, FLA(G) ((98)DRGWGNGCGLFGK(110)) and FLA(H) ((98)DRGWGNHCGLFGK(110)), and investigated the role of the charge of the target membrane on the fusion process. We used an in silico approach to simulate the interaction of the FPs with a lipid bilayer in a complementary way and used spectroscopic approaches to collect conformation information. We found that both peptides interact with neutral and anionic micelles, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed the interaction of the FPs with the lipid bilayer. The participation of the indole ring of Trp appeared to be important for the anchoring of both peptides in the membrane model, as indicated by MD simulations and spectroscopic analyses. Mild differences between FLA(G) and FLA(H) were observed according to the pH and the charge of the target membrane model. The MD simulations of the membrane showed that both peptides adopted a bend structure, and an interaction between the aromatic residues was strongly suggested, which was also observed by circular dichroism in the presence of micelles. As the FPs of viral fusion proteins play a key role in the mechanism of viral fusion, understanding the interactions between peptides and membranes is crucial for medical science and biology and may contribute to the design of new antiviral drugs.

Recent studies have indicated that the Notch signalling pathway is important in PDAC initiation and maintenance, although the specific cell biological roles of the pathway remain to be established. Here we sought to examine this question in established pancreatic cancer cell lines using the gamma-secretase inhibitor IX (GSI IX) to inactivate Notch. Based on the known roles of Notch in development and stem cell biology, we focused on effects on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and on pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells. We analyzed the effect of the GSI IX on growth and epithelial plasticity of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and on the tumorigenicity of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells. Notably, apoptosis was induced after GSI IX treatment and EMT markers were selectively targeted. Furthermore, under GSI IX treatment, decline in the growth of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells was observed in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. This study demonstrates a central role of Notch signalling pathway in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and identifies an effective approach to inhibit selectively EMT and suppress tumorigenesis by eliminating pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells.

The first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to four new species are still being found every year. Extrapolation of the discovery curve suggests that there is still a substantial pool of undiscovered human virus species, although an apparent slow-down in the rate of discovery of species from different families may indicate bounds to the potential range of diversity. More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human hosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A few possible predictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of phylogenetically conserved cell receptors. It seems almost inevitable that new human viruses will continue to emerge, mainly from other mammals and birds, for the foreseeable future. For this reason, an effective global surveillance system for novel viruses is needed.

Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are crucial mediators of antiviral responses(1) and their transcription is regulated by a variety of transcription factors(2); principal among these is the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)(3). The IRF gene regulatory networks are complex and contain multiple feedback loops. The tools of systems biology are well suited to elucidate the complex interactions that give rise to precise coordination of the interferon response. Here we have used an unbiased systems approach to predict that a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, FOXO3, is a negative regulator of a subset of antiviral genes. This prediction was validated using macrophages isolated from Foxo3-null mice. Genome-wide location analysis combined with gene deletion studies identified the Irf7 gene as a critical target of FOXO3. FOXO3 was identified as a negative regulator of Irf7 transcription and we have further demonstrated that FOXO3, IRF7 and IFN-I forma coherent feed-forward regulatory circuit. Our data suggest that the FOXO3-IRF7 regulatory circuit represents a novel mechanism for establishing the requisite set points in the interferon pathway that balances the beneficial effects and deleterious sequelae of the antiviral response.

A highly convergent first generation synthesis led to the complete stereochemical assignment and demonstrated that psymberin and irciniastatin A are identical compounds. This synthesis featured a diastereoselective aldol coupling between the aryl fragment and a central tetrahydropyran core and a novel one-pot procedure to convert an amide, via intermediacy of a sensitive methyl imidate, to the N-acyl aminal reminiscent of psymberin.

We have previously shown that triptolide, a diterpenoid, is effective against pancreatic cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. However, triptolide is poorly soluble in water, limiting its clinical use. We therefore synthesized a water-soluble analog of triptolide, named Minnelide. The efficacy of Minnelide was tested both in vitro and in multiple independent yet complementary in vivo models of pancreatic cancer: an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer using human pancreatic cancer cell lines in athymic nude mice, a xenograft model where human pancreatic tumors were transplanted into severe combined immunodeficient mice, and a spontaneous pancreatic cancer mouse model (KRas(G12D); Trp53(R172H); Pdx-1Cre). In these multiple complementary models of pancreatic cancer, Minnelide was highly effective in reducing pancreatic tumor growth and spread, and improving survival.

Early germline-like cells spontaneously appeared in L929 cells and further differentiated into oocyte-like cells. These germline-like cells can, in turn, develop into blastocyst-like structures in vitro and cause teratocarcinomas in vivo, which is consistent with natural germ cells in function. Generation of germline-like cells from somatic tumors might provide a novel way to understand why somatic cancer cells have strong features of embryonic/germline development.

We compared fitness-related behavioral traits, breeding activity, and the effects of exposure to the environmental estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2) on reproduction in a laboratory (Wild Indian Karyotype, WIK) strain and a wild-caught population (Bangladesh, BLD01) of Danio rerio (zebrafish). In WIK fish, males with higher observed heterozygocity were more active reproductively and more successful in securing parentage, but these relationships were not apparent in the BLD01 fish. The frequency of reproductive behaviors increased in WIK zebrafish for exposure to 0.4 ng/L EE2, which was not apparent in the BLD01 zebrafish. The different strains showed the same threshold for hepatic vitellogenin gene (vtg) induction (2.2 ng EE2/L), but results suggested an elevated response level in the BLD01. There were no effects on total egg production up to 2.2 ng EE2/L in either population; however, there was reduced egg fertilization rate at 2.2 ng EE2/L in the BLD01 fish. These results show consistency in the general responses to EE2 between these two genetically divergent strains of zebrafish, but also illustrate differences in their breeding biology and response sensitivities.

Notably, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are antidepressant agents increasingly prescribed to manage antenatal mood disorders, and depressed maternal mood per se during pregnancy impacts infant behavior, also raising concerns about long-term consequences following such developmental exposure. We studied whether infants' language development is altered by prenatal exposure to SRIs and whether such effects differ from exposure to maternal mood disturbances. Infants from non-SRI-treated mothers with little or no depression (control), depressed but non-SRI-treated (depressed-only), and depressed and treated with an SRI (SRI-exposed) were studied at 36 wk gestation (while still in utero) on a consonant and vowel discrimination task and at 6 and 10 mo of age on a nonnative speech and visual language discrimination task. Whereas the control infants responded as expected (success at 6 mo and failure at 10 mo) the SRI-exposed infants failed to discriminate the language differences at either age and the depressed-only infants succeeded at 10 mo instead of 6 mo. Fetuses at 36 wk gestation in the control condition performed as expected, with a response on vowel but not consonant discrimination, whereas the SRI-exposed fetuses showed accelerated perceptual development by discriminating both vowels and consonants. Thus, prenatal depressed maternal mood and SRI exposure were found to shift developmental milestones bidirectionally on infant speech perception tasks.

Here, we report the high resolution (1.35 angstrom) structure of EGFP crystallised in its untagged sequence form that reveals the combined impact of the F64L and S65T, that give rise to improved folding and spectral characteristics. The overall structure of EGFP is very similar to wt GFP, forming the classical beta-barrel fold with the chromophore containing helix running through the core of the structure. Replacement of Phe64 with Leu in EGFP results in subtle rearrangement of hydrophobic core packing close to the chromophore including the reduction in surface exposure of two hydrophobic residues. Replacement of Ser65 with Thr has a significant impact on the local hydrogen bond network in the vicinity of the chromophore. Detailed analysis of electron density reveals that several residues close to the chromophore occupy at least two distinct conformations. This includes Glu222 that defines the charged state on the chromophore, with the two conformations having slightly different effects on the hydrogen bond network surrounding the chromophore. Hence, the reported high-resolution structure of EGFP has provided a long overdue molecular description of one of the most important fluorescent protein variants currently in general use.

Tospoviruses cause significant economic damage to a wide range of crops in many parts of the world. The genetic or molecular basis of the continued emergence of new tospoviruses and new hosts is not well understood though it is generally accepted that reassortment and/or genetic complementation among the three genomic segments of individual viruses could be contributing to this variability since plants infected with more than one tospovirus are not uncommon in nature.Methodology/Principal Findings: Two distinct and economically important tospoviruses, Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), were investigated for inter-virus interactions at the molecular level in dually-infected plants. Datura (Datura stramonium) is a permissive host for TSWV, while it restricts the movement of IYSV to inoculated leaves. In plants infected with both viruses, however, TSWV facilitated the selective movement of the viral gene silencing suppressor (NSs) gene of IYSV to the younger, uninoculated leaves. The small RNA expression profiles of IYSV and TSWV in single- and dually-infected datura plants showed that systemic leaves of dually-infected plants had reduced levels of TSWV N gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). No TSWV NSs-specific siRNAs were detected either in the inoculated or systemic leaves of dually-infected datura plants indicating a more efficient suppression of host silencing machinery in the presence of NSs from both viruses as compared to the presence of only TSWV NSs.Conclusion/Significance: Our study identifies a new role for the viral gene silencing suppressor in potentially modulating the biology and host range of viruses and underscores the importance of virally-coded suppressors of gene silencing in virus infection of plants.

However, in the model system of Drosophila larvae this oftentimes proves difficult due to limitations in imaging capabilities. Using the larval wing imaginal disc, we show that both overall growth, as well as the creation of patterns such as the distinction between the anterior(A) and posterior(P) compartments and the dorsal(D) and ventral(V) compartments can be studied directly by imaging the wing disc as it develops inside a larva. Imaged larvae develop normally, as can be seen by the overall growth curve of the wing disc. Yet, the fact that we can follow the development of individual discs through time provides the opportunity to simultaneously assess individual variability. We for instance find that growth rates can vary greatly over time. In addition, we observe that mechanical forces act on the wing disc within the larva at times when there is an increase in growth rates. Moreover, we observe that A/P boundary formation follows the established sequence and a smooth boundary is present from the first larval instar on. The division of the wing disc into a dorsal and a ventral compartment, on the other hand, develops quite differently. Contrary to expectation, the specification of the dorsal compartment starts with only one or two cells in the second larval instar and a smooth boundary is not formed until the third larval instar.

Here, we introduce a simple and general approach to rapidly tune gene networks in Escherichia coli using hypermutable simple sequence repeats embedded in the spacer region of the ribosome binding site. By varying repeat length, we generated expression libraries that incrementally and predictably sample gene expression levels over a 1,000-fold range. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by creating a bistable switch library that programmatically samples the expression space to balance the two states of the switch, and we illustrate the need for tuning by showing that the switch's behavior is sensitive to host context.

The regulation of actin assembly and modulation of filament mechanical properties are critical for proper actin function. It is well established that physiological salt concentrations promote actin assembly and alter the overall bending mechanics of assembled filaments and networks. However, the molecular origins of these salt-dependent effects, particularly if they involve nonspecific ionic strength effects or specific ion-binding interactions, are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that specific cation binding at two discrete sites situated between adjacent subunits along the long-pitch helix drive actin polymerization and determine the filament bending rigidity. We classify the two sites as ""polymerization"" and ""stiffness"" sites based on the effects that mutations at the sites have on salt-dependent filament assembly and bending mechanics, respectively. These results establish the existence and location of the cation-binding sites that confer salt dependence to the assembly and mechanics of actin filaments.

One long-standing hypothesis, based on similarities in neuronal connectivity, proposes that homologs of the layer 4 input and layer 5 output neurons of neocortex are present in the avian forebrain, where they contribute to specific nuclei rather than to layers. We devised a molecular test of this hypothesis based on layer-specific gene expression that is shared across rodent and carnivore neocortex. Our findings establish that the layer 4 input and the layer 5 output cell types are conserved across the amniotes, but are organized into very different architectures, forming nuclei in birds, cortical areas in reptiles, and cortical layers in mammals.

Most studies of the evolution of new pathways have focused on the origins and quality of function of the enzymes involved. However, there is an additional layer of complexity that has received less attention. Introduction of a novel pathway into an existing metabolic network can result in inhibitory cross-talk due to adventitious interactions between metabolites and macromolecules that have not previously encountered one another. Here, we report a thorough examination of inhibitory cross-talk between a novel metabolic pathway for synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the existing metabolic network of Escherichia coli. We demonstrate multiple problematic interactions, including (i) interference by metabolites in the novel pathway with metabolic processes in the existing network, (ii) interference by metabolites in the existing network with the function of the novel pathway, and (iii) diversion of metabolites from the novel pathway by promiscuous activities of enzymes in the existing metabolic network. Identification of the mechanisms of inhibitory cross-talk can reveal the types of adaptations that must occur to enhance the performance of a novel metabolic pathway as well as the fitness of the microbial host. These findings have important implications for evolutionary studies of the emergence of novel pathways in nature as well as genetic engineering of microbes for ""green"" manufacturing processes.

In animal models, estrogen protects females from vascular injury and inhibits atherosclerosis. These effects are mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs), which, when bound to estrogen, can bind to DNA to directly regulate transcription. ERs can also activate several cellular kinases by inducing a rapid nonnuclear signaling cascade. However, the biological significance of this rapid signaling pathway has been unclear.Methods and Results-In the present study, we develop a novel transgenic mouse in which rapid signaling is blocked by overexpression of a peptide that prevents ERs from interacting with the scaffold protein striatin (the disrupting peptide mouse). Microarray analysis of ex vivo treated mouse aortas demonstrates that rapid ER signaling plays an important role in estrogen-mediated gene regulatory responses. Disruption of ER-striatin interactions also eliminates the ability of estrogen to stimulate cultured endothelial cell migration and to inhibit cultured vascular smooth muscle cell growth. The importance of these findings is underscored by in vivo experiments demonstrating loss of estrogen-mediated protection against vascular injury in the disrupting peptide mouse after carotid artery wire injury.Conclusions-Taken together, these results support the concept that rapid, nonnuclear ER signaling contributes to the transcriptional regulatory functions of ER and is essential for many of the vasoprotective effects of estrogen. These findings also identify the rapid ER signaling pathway as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic agents. (Circulation. 2012;126:1993-2004.)

However, this same agent does not generally benefit colon cancer patients who have the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Recent work suggests that BRAF(V600E) inhibition by vemurafenib results in decreased negative feedback to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and that the different clinical responses are due to differences in the amount of EGFR present in these two cancers. The experimental work that identified the feedback signaling was an elegant mix of functional genomic approaches and focused, hypothesis-driven cellular and molecular biology. The results of these studies suggest that combined treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven colon cancers with both vemurafenib and EGFR inhibitors is worth clinical evaluation.

This study was conducted on eight coffee agroforests in Costa Rica, in order to identify particular mechanisms preventing nutrient leaching losses. First, we examined how nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) leaching losses differed between coffee agroforests amended with mineral or organic fertilizers. Monthly N and P concentrations were measured in soil water using tension lysimeters (at 15 and 100 cm) between October 2008 and September 2009, and a water balance model was developed to estimate annual nutrient leaching losses from these agroforests. Second, we examined the effects of human interventions (fertilizer type and quantity), biology (shade trees), and chemistry (soil properties) on nutrient leaching losses. Despite differences in the quantity and form of fertilizer inputs, N and P losses at 100 cm did not differ significantly between organically and conventionally managed agroforests (119 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Rather, N losses declined linearly with increasing shade tree biomass, which is determined by farmers. Phosphorus losses, on the other hand, declined with increasing soil iron pools, which are independent of management decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ET-1 modulates cardiac contractility, systemic and renal vascular resistance, salt and water renal reabsorption, and glomerular function. ET-1 is responsible for a variety of cellular events: contraction, proliferation, apoptosis, etc. These effects take place after the activation of the two endothelin receptors ETA and ETB, which are present - among others - on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, glomerular and tubular cells of the kidney. The complex and numerous intracellular pathways, which can be contradictory in term of functional response depending on the receptor type, cell type and physiological situation, are described in this review. Many diseases share an enhanced ET-1 expression as part of the pathophysiology. However, the use of endothelin blockers is currently restricted to pulmonary arterial hypertension, and more recently to digital ulcer. The complexity of the endothelin system does not facilitate the translation of the molecular knowledge to clinical applications. Endothelin antagonists can prevent disease development but secondary undesirable effects limit their usage. Nevertheless, the increasing understanding of the effects of ET-I on the cardiac and renal physiology maintains the endothelin system as a promising therapeutic target. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Two cognate receptors, EDNRA and EDNRB are constitutively expressed in the ovary, and mediate the regulatory endothelin actions. However, the physiological significance of the presence of the two receptors that often elicit opposite responses upon activation by an endothelin is yet to be determined. This study was proposed to test the hypothesis that both receptors are present in the ovary to lend an endothelin a finite regulation of ovulation.Main methods: A rescued EDNRB knockout (rEDNRB-KO) mouse that is deficient of EDNRB expression in all cells but adrenergic cell lineage was used to test the impact of the loss of function of EDNRB on ovulation. The EDNRB gene deletion and its confirmation at mRNA level were assessed by molecular biology techniques, and the number and size of corpus lutea was determined by ovarian histology.Key findings: Female rEDNRB-KO mice had larger litter sizes (numbers of pups per birth) and their ovaries contained more corpora lutea than wild type littermates.Significance: This result shows that without EDNRB excessive ovulation occurs, suggesting a role of EDNRB in having the extent of ovulation confined.

The potential clinical relevance of this receptor has been suggested from numerous studies that have identified GPER expression in breast, endometrial, ovarian and other cancers. Thus GPER can be considered a candidate biomarker and target for non-invasive imaging and therapy. We have designed and synthesized a series of organometallic tricarbonyl-rhenium complexes conjugated to a GPER-selective small molecule derived from tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c] quinoline. The activity and selectivity of these chelates in GPER-mediated signaling pathways were evaluated. These results demonstrate that GPER targeting characteristics depend strongly on the structure of the chelate and linkage. Ethanone conjugates functioned as agonists, a 1,2,3-triazole spacer yielded an antagonist, and derivatives with increased steric volume exhibited decreased activities. Promising GPER selectivity was observed, as none of the complexes interacted with the nuclear estrogen receptors. Radiolabeling with technetium-99m in aqueous media was efficient and gave radioligands with high radiochemical yields and purity. These chelates have favorable physicochemical properties, show excellent stability in biologically relevant media, exhibit receptor specificity and are promising candidates for continuing development as diagnostic imaging agents targeting GPER expression in cancer.

In normoxic condition, PHD2 triggers the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1 alpha) that induces the expression of hypoxia response genes. Therefore the correct function of PHD2 would inhibit angiogenesis and consequent metastasis of tumor cells in normoxic condition. PHD2 mutations were reported in some common cancers. However, high levels of HIF-1 alpha protein were observed even in normoxic metastatic tumors with normal expression of wild type PHD2. PHD2 malfunctions due to protein misfolding may be the underlying reason of metastasis and invasion in such cases. In this study, we scrutinize the unfolding pathways of the PHD2 catalytic domain's possible species and demonstrate the properties of their unfolding states by computational approaches. Our study introduces the possibility of aggregation disaster for the prominent species of PHD2 during its partial unfolding. This may justify PHD2 inability to regulate HIF-1 alpha level in some normoxic tumor types.

Although temporal patterns of phenotypic gene expression have been relatively well characterized during the course of differentiation, coincident patterns of endogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factor expression that accompany pluripotent stem cell differentiation remain much less well-defined. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the global dynamic profiles of ECM and growth factor genes associated with early stages of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Gene expression analysis of ECM and growth factors by ESCs differentiating as embryoid bodies for up to 14 days was assessed using PCR arrays (172 unique genes total), and the results were examined using a variety of data mining methods. As expected, decreases in the expression of genes regulating pluripotent stem cell fate preceded subsequent increases in morphogen expression associated with differentiation. Pathway analysis generated solely from ECM and growth factor gene expression highlighted morphogenic cell processes within the embryoid bodies, such as cell growth, migration, and intercellular signaling, that are required for primitive tissue and organ developmental events. In addition, systems analysis of ECM and growth factor gene expression alone identified intracellular molecules and signaling pathways involved in the progression of pluripotent stem cell differentiation that were not contained within the array data set. Overall, these studies represent a novel framework to dissect the complex, dynamic nature of the extracellular biochemical milieu of stem cell microenvironments that regulate pluripotent cell fate decisions and morphogenesis.

One concern regarding NMR studies of frozen solution protein samples at low temperatures is that they may have poor linewidths, thus preventing high-resolution studies. To learn more about how the solvent shell composition and temperature affects the protein linewidth, we recorded H-1, H-2, and C-13 spectra of ubiquitin in frozen water and frozen glycerol-water solutions at different temperatures. We found that the C-13 protein linewidths generally increase with decreasing temperature. This line broadening was found to be inhomogeneous and independent of proton decoupling. In pure water, we observe an abrupt line broadening with the freezing of the bulk solvent, followed by continuous line broadening at lower temperatures. In frozen glycerol-water, we did not observe an abrupt line broadening and the NMR lines were generally narrower than for pure water at the same temperature. H-1 and H-2 measurements characterizing the dynamics of water that is in exchange with the protein showed that the C-13 line broadening is relatively independent from the arrest of isotropic water motions.

However, Ogino et al. make an assumption that epidemiology has previously not included pathology or modern technologies in epidemiologic studies and that there is a unique need for the specialty of MPE. The new molecular pathology is yet another technique that can improve epidemiologic investigations. There is a long tradition of combining good pathology with epidemiologic research, especially in studies of cardiovascular disease. Large epidemiologic studies have successfully integrated specialty expertise in a collaborative and mutually beneficial approach to test specific hypotheses. The author is concerned that MPE techniques, whether they involve metabolomics, genomics, proteomics, or microarrays, will come to drive epidemiologic studies without any specific hypothesis-testing or unique population characteristics.

How functionally differentiated cells already committed to a specific cell lineage can transdifferentiate into other cell types is a key question in cell biology and regenerative medicine. In the present study we show that porcine ovarian follicular GCs (granulosa cells) can transdifferentiate into osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo. Pure GCs isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FBS (fetal bovine serum) proliferated and dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells. We referred to these cells as DFOG (dedifferentiated follicular granulosa) cells. Microarray analysis showed that DFOG cells lost expression of GC-specific marker genes, but gained the expression of osteogenic marker genes during dedifferentiation. After osteogenic induction, DFOG cells underwent terminal osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization in vitro. Furthermore, when DFOG cells were transplanted subcutaneously into SCID mice, these cells formed ectopic osteoid tissue. These results indicate that DFOG cells derived from GCs can differentiate into osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that GCs provide a useful model for studying the mechanisms of transdifferentiation into other cell lineages in functionally differentiated cells.

In this article, we make the case for a new paradigm in which therapeutics are assessed on a continuous scale by evidence of efficacy, using a variety of quantitative tools that take advantage of technologic innovations and increasing understanding of cancer biology. The new paradigm relies on randomized comparisons between investigational arms and control arms, as historical controls are unavailable or unreliable for these quantitative measures. We discuss multiple limitations of RECIST, including its overemphasis on tumor regression, concerns about the accuracy of tumor measurements and the validity of comparisons with historical controls, and its inadequacy in disease settings in which tumor measurements on cross-sectional imaging are difficult or uninformative.

Due to the complexity of removing this form of DNA damage, no single DNA repair pathway has been shown to be capable of eradicating ICLs. In eukaryotes, ICL repair is a complex process, principally because several repair pathways compete for ICL repair intermediates in a strictly cell cycle-dependent manner. Yeast cells require a combination of nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination repair and postreplication repair/translesion DNA synthesis to remove ICLs. There are also a number of additional ICL repair factors originally identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, called Pso1 through 10, of which Pso2 has an apparently dedicated role in ICL repair. Mammalian cells respond to ICLs by a complex network guided by factors mutated in the inherited cancer-prone disorder Fanconi anemia (FA). Although enormous progress has been made over recent years in identifying and characterizing FA factors as well as in elucidating certain aspects of the biology of FA, the mechanistic details of the ICL repair defects in FA patients remain unknown. Dissection of the FA DNA damage response pathway has, in part, been limited by the absence of FA-like pathways in highly tractable model organisms, such as yeast. Although S. cerevisiae possesses putative homologs of the FA factors FANCM, FANCJ and FANCP (Mph1, Chl1 and Slx4, respectively) as well as of the FANCM-associated proteins MHF1 and MHF2 (Mhf1 and Mhf2), the corresponding mutants display no significant increase in sensitivity to ICLs. Nevertheless, we and others have recently shown that these FA homologs, along with several other factors, control an ICL repair pathway, which has an overlapping or redundant role with a Pso2-controlled pathway. This pathway acts in S-phase and serves to prevent ICL-stalled replication forks from collapsing into DNA double-strand breaks.

Thus, an understanding of their inactivation mechanisms could be useful for the development of new classes of chemical selective inhibitors. In the marine environment, several bioactive terpenoids possess interesting anti-inflammatory activity, often through covalent and/or noncovalent inactivation of sPLA2. Herein, we report the molecular mechanism of human group IIA phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) inactivation by Scalaradial (SLD), a marine 1,4-dialdehyde terpenoid isolated from the sponge Cacospongia mollior and endowed with a significant anti-inflammatory profile. Our results have been collected by a combination of biochemical approaches, advanced mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular modeling. These suggest that SLD acts as a competitive inhibitor. Indeed, the sPLA2-IIA inactivation process seems to be driven by the noncovalent recognition process of SLD in the enzyme active site and by chelation of the catalytic calcium ion. In contrast, covalent modification of the enzyme by the SLD dialdehyde moiety emerges as only a minor side event in the ligandenzyme interaction. These results could be helpful for the rational design of new PLA2 inhibitors that would be able to selectively target the enzyme active site.

In spite of this critical concentration dependence, current approaches to NO delivery in vitro result in biologically irrelevant and poorly controlled levels, with hyperoxic conditions imposed by ambient air. To solve these problems, we developed a system for controlled delivery of NO and O-2 over large concentration ranges to mimic biological conditions. Here we describe the fabrication, operation and calibration of the delivery system. We then describe applications for delivery of NO and O-2 into cell culture media, with a comparison of experimental results and predictions from mass transfer models that predict the steady-state levels of various NO-derived reactive species.

Mutations in the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1/STK11) gene are associated with the pathogenesis of PJS and have been identified in non-PJS patients with sporadic testicular cancers. The mechanisms controlled by LKB1 signaling in Sertoli cell functions and testicular biology have not been described. We have conditionally deleted the Lkb1 gene (Lkb1(cko)) in somatic testicular cells to define the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of the testicular phenotype observed in PJS patients. Focal vacuolization in some of the seminiferous tubules was observed in 4-week-old mutant testes but germ cell development appeared to be normal. However, similar to PJS patients, we observed progressive germ cell loss and Sertoli cell only tubules in Lkb1(cko) testes from mice older than 10 weeks, accompanied by defects in Sertoli cell polarity and testicular junctional complexes and decreased activation of the MAP/microtubule affinity regulating and focal adhesion kinases. Suppression of AMP kinase and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling were also observed in Lkb1(cko) testes. Loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2 copies the progressive Lkb1(cko) phenotype, suggesting that dysregulated activation of mTOR contributes to the pathogenesis of the Lkb1(cko) testicular phenotype. Pten(cko) mice had a normal testicular phenotype, which could be explained by the comparative lack of mTOR activation detected. These studies describe the importance of LKB1 signaling in testicular biology and the possible molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of the testicular defects observed in PJS patients.

Over the past decade, genetic association studies have largely focused on common, easy to measure genetic variants shared between many individuals. These common variants typically have subtle functional consequence and translating the resulting association signals into biological insights can be challenging. In the last few years, exome sequencing has emerged as a cost-effective strategy for extending these studies to include rare coding variants, which often have more marked functional consequences. Here, we provide practical guidance in the design and analysis of complex trait association studies focused on rare, coding variants.

The effects of surface properties on cell compatibility of the membranes were elucidated. PPC tended to assemble to independent phases in the composite membranes, while OPC formed uniformly distributed LC domains. As the introduction of LC, phase separation occurred, and the crystallization of PU was disrupted. The surface of PU/LC composite membranes showed fingerprint texture and two-phase morphology. Hydrophilicity of the two types of composite membranes exhibited a reversal tendency with the increase of LC contents. Cells seeded on the composite membranes presented favorable growth when the content of LC was over 30%, especially on PU/OPC complex. The surface morphology, phase separation between LC and PU as well as the type of LC showed significant effects on the cell behaviors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To gain new insights into the biology of this complex protein, we have initiated the molecular characterization of the LRP2 homolog from an oviparous species, the chicken (Gallus gallus). The galline LRP2 cDNA encodes a membrane protein of 4658 residues. Overall, the galline and human proteins are 73% identical, indicating that the avian gene has been well conserved over 300 million years. Unexpectedly, LRP2 transcript and protein levels in the kidney of females and estrogen-treated roosters were significantly higher than those in untreated males. The estrogen-responsiveness of avian LRP2 may be related to the dramatic differences in lipoprotein metabolism between mature roosters and laying hens. Newly identified potential estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) in the human and galline LRP2 gene, and additional SO sites present in the promoter of the chicken gene, are compatible with both direct estrogen induction via the classical ligand-induced ERE pathway and the indirect transcription factor crosstalk pathway engaging the Sp1 sites. In agreement with this assumption, estrogen induction of LRP2 was observed not only in primary cultured chicken kidney cells, but also human kidney cell lines. These findings point to novel regulatory features of the LRP2 gene resulting in sex-specific receptor expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phylogenetic relationships of this well-corroborated natural group and diverse clade are critical to not only informing scientific communities of the phylogeny of the order Cypriniformes, the world's largest freshwater fish order, but are key to every area of comparative biology examining the evolution of traits, functional structures, and breeding behaviors to their biogeographic histories, speciation, anagenetic divergence, and divergence time estimates. In the present study, two mitochondrial gene sequences (COI, ND4 + 5) and four single-copy nuclear gene segments (RH1, RAG1, EGR2B, IRBP) were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the Cobitoidea as reconstructed from maximum likelihood (ML) and partitioned Bayesian Analysis (BA). Analyses of the combined mitochondrial/nuclear gene datasets revealed five strongly supported monophyletic Cobitoidea families and their sister-group relationships: Botiidae + (Vaillantellidae + (Cobitidae + (Nemacheilidae + Balitoridae))). These recovered relationships are in agreement with previous systematic studies on the order Cypriniformes and/or those focusing on the superfamily Cobitoidea. Using these relationships, our analyses revealed pattern lineageor ecological-group-specific evolution of these genes for the Cobitoidea. These observations and results corroborate the hypothesis that these group-specific-ancestral ecological characters have contributed in the diversification and/or adaptations within these groups. Positive selections were detected in RH1 of nemacheilids and in RAG1 of nemacheilids and genus Vaillantella, which indicated that evolution of RH1 (related to eye's optic sense) and RAG1 (related to immunity) genes appeared to be important for the diversification of these groups. The balitorid lineage (those species inhabiting fast-flowing riverine habitats) had, as compared with other cobitoid lineages, significantly different dN/dS, dN and dS values for ND4 and IRBP genes. These significant differences are usually indicative of weaker selection pressure, and lineage-specific evolution on genes along the balitorid lineage. Furthermore, within Cobitoidea, excluding balitorids, species living in subtropics had significantly higher dN/dS values in RAG1 and IRBP genes than those living in temperate and tropical zones. Among tropical cobitoids, genes COI, ND5, EGR2B, IRBP and RH1, had a significantly higher mean dS value than those species in subtropical and temperate groups. These findings suggest that the evolution of these genes could also be ecological-group-specific and may have played an important role in the adaptive evolution and diversification of these groups. Thus, we hypothesize that the genes included in the present study were actively involved in lineage- and/or ecological-group-specific evolutionary processes of the highly diverse Cobitoidea. These two evolutionary patterns, both subject to further testing, are hypothesized as integral in the diversification with this major clade of the world's most diverse group of freshwater fishes.

It has attracted great attention due to its invasive nature when transported to new areas in its non-native range. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast (cp) genome of Elodea. Taxonomically Elodea is a basal monocot, and only few monocot cp genomes representing early lineages of monocots have been sequenced so far. The genome is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule 156,700 bp in length, and has a typical structure with large (LSC 86,194 bp) and small (SSC 17,810 bp) single-copy regions separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs 26,348 bp each). The Elodea cp genome contains 113 unique genes and 16 duplicated genes in the IR regions. A comparative analysis showed that the gene order and organization of the Elodea cp genome is almost identical to that of Amborella trichopoda, a basal angiosperm. The structure of IRs in Elodea is unique among monocot species with the whole cp genome sequenced. In Elodea and another monocot Lemna minor the borders between IRs and LSC are located upstream of rps19 gene and downstream of trnH-GUG gene, while in most monocots, IR has extended to include both trnH and rps19 genes. A phylogenetic analysis conducted using Bayesian method, based on the DNA sequences of 81 chloroplast genes from 17 monocot taxa provided support for the placement of Elodea together with Lemna as a basal monocot and the next diverging lineage of monocots after Acorales. In comparison with other monocots, the Elodea cp genome has gone through only few rearrangements or gene losses. IR of Elodea has a unique structure among the monocot species studied so far as its structure is similar to that of a basal angiosperm Amborella. This result together with phylogenetic analyses supports the placement of Elodea as a basal monocot to the next diverging lineage of monocots after Acorales. So far, only few cp genomes representing early lineages of monocots have been sequenced and, therefore, this study provides valuable information about the course of evolution in divergence of monocot lineages.

In the present study, maturation of germinal vesicle-stage marmoset oocytes were evaluated in the following media: Waymouth medium, Waymouth medium containing porcine follicular fluid (pFF) (Waymouth-pFF medium), and porcine oocyte medium (POM). Oocytes cultured in Waymouth-pFF medium had higher maturation rates to the metaphase II stage than those cultured in Waymouth medium (36.1% vs. 24.8%, respectively, P < 0.05), indicating the suitability of this medium for culturing marmoset oocytes. Hence, maturation of marmoset oocytes cultured in POM was subsequently evaluated. The rate of maturation to the metaphase [stage was significantly higher and degradation rates were significantly lower in oocytes cultured in POM than those cultured in Waymouth medium. In addition, three offspring were successfully obtained after transfer of embryos matured in chemically defined medium. Therefore, we concluded that POM was suitable for marmoset oocyte culture. Furthermore, this was apparently the first report of marmoset offspring derived from oocytes cultured in chemically defined medium. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our study aimed to evaluate CUSPIO biomarkers for the assessment of tumor response to antiangiogenic therapy. CUSPIO imaging was performed in subcutaneous rat C6 gliomas before and 2 days after treatment with the potent VEGF-signaling inhibitor cediranib (n = 12), or vehicle (n = 12). Histological validation of Hoechst 33342 uptake (perfusion), smooth muscle actin staining (maturation), pimonidazole adduct formation (hypoxia) and necrosis were sought. Following treatment, there was a significant decrease in fractional blood volume (-43%, p < 0.01) and a significant increase in hemodynamic vascular functionality (treatment altered ?R2*carbogen from 1.2 to -0.2 s-1, p < 0.05). CUSPIO imaging revealed an overall significant decrease in plasma perfusion (-27%, p < 0.05) following cediranib treatment, that was associated with selective effects on immature blood vessels. The CUSPIO responses were associated with a significant 15% reduction in Hoechst 33342 uptake (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in vascular maturation or necrosis. Additionally, treatment with cediranib resulted in a significant 40% increase in tumor hypoxia (p < 0.05). The CUSPIO imaging method provides novel and more specific biomarkers of tumor vessel maturity and vascular hemodynamics, and their response to VEGF-signaling inhibition, compared to current MR imaging biomarkers utilized in the clinic. Such biomarkers may prove effective in longitudinally monitoring tumor vascular remodeling and/or evasive resistance in response to antiangiogenic therapy.

In daily clinical routine, systemic chemotherapy is still considered the only reasonable therapy despite of encouraging results of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (HIPEC). The Achilles heel of CRS and HIPEC is appropriate patient selection and precise surgical technique preventing patients from excessive morbidity and mortality. Given these findings, new concepts of second look surgery for high risk patients allow detection of peritoneal spread ahead of clinical symptoms or presence of peritoneal masses reducing perioperative morbidity. In addition, personalized intraperitoneal chemotherapy might further improve outcome by appreciating individual tumor biology. These days, every physician should be aware of CRS and HIPEC for treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies. Since there is now sufficient data for the superiority of CRS and HIPEC to systemic chemotherapy in selected patients, our next goal should be providing this strategy with minimal morbidity and mortality even in the presence of higher tumor load.

RA responses are mediated by transcriptional activation by the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) in cooperation with various types of coregulators at RA-responsive gene promoters. Here, we identified CDK2-associated cullin (CAC1) as a novel type of RAR alpha coregulator that interacts with RAR alpha and inhibits its transcriptional activity. The CoRNR box of CAC1 is required for the binding to and inactivation of RAR alpha. In addition, CAC1 cooperates with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to suppress RAR alpha, probably by associating with HDAC. Finally, depletion of CAC1 increases RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, a response accompanied by significant upregulation of the neuronal marker nestin. From these results, we suggest that CAC1 is a novel corepressor of RAR alpha that cooperates with HDACs and is involved in the regulation of RA-induced cellular differentiation.

We noticed that there is unspecific vascular expression when using fli1a:EGFP transgenic embryos for whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) experiments. We therefore tested whether the residual vector sequence contained in the fli1a:EGFP transgene or the integration of transgene into the genome may cause this expression 'noise' and/or deregulation of gene expression at a genome-wide level. RNA probes were synthesized using two different methods, i.e. vector-based and PCR-based. The vector-based dnmt3 probe showed unspecific vascular expression in fli1a:EGFP embryos, but not in wildtype embryos, by WISH. moreover, we also found that compared to that in wildtype, there were alterations in gene expression at whole-genome level in the fli1a:EGFP embryos. Our finding that the vector sequence contained in the fli1a:EGFP genome causes unspecific vascular expression by WISH and the genome-wide expression profiling is altered in fli1a:EGFP embryos strongly argue that extra caution should be taken for data interpretation when using transgenics, such as fli1a:EGFP, in developmental biology studies.

Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to investigate the design principles governing cell polarization. First, using a coarse-grained computational model, we searched for all possible simple networks that can achieve polarization. All solutions contained one of three minimal motifs: positive feedback, mutual inhibition, or inhibitor with positive feedback. These minimal motifs alone could achieve polarization under limited conditions; circuits that combined two or more of these motifs were significantly more robust. With these design principles as a blueprint, we experimentally constructed artificial polarization networks in yeast, using a toolkit of chimeric signaling proteins that spatially direct the synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Circuits with combinatorial motifs yielded clear foci of synthetic PIP3 that can persist for nearly an hour. Thus, by harnessing localization-regulated signaling molecules, we can engineer simple molecular circuits that reliably execute spatial self-organized programs.

In the current research, we make a major step forward in the development of at-line bioassays by implementation of radioligand receptor binding and functional cellular assays to evaluate bioactvity and selectivity. We demonstrate a new platform for high-resolution metabolic profiling of lead compounds for functional activity and selectivity toward the human histamine H-4 receptor (hH(4)R), a member of the large family of membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors. In this platform analytical chemistry, cell biology and pharmacology are merged. The methodology is based on chromatographic separation of metabolic mixtures by HPLC coupled to high-resolution fractionation onto (multiple) microtiter well plates for complementary assaying. The methodology was used for efficient and rapid metabolic profiling of the drug clozapine and three selective hH(4)R lead compounds. With this new platform metabolites with undesired alterations in target selectivity profiles can be readily identified. Moreover, the parallel identification of metabolite structures. with accurate-mass measurements and MS/MS, allowed identification of liable metabolic 'hotspots' for further lead optimization and plays a central role in the workflow and in this study. The methodology can be easily adapted for use with other receptor screening formats.

Moreover, data from several systems show that morphogen gradients, downstream signaling, and the activity of cell-intrinsic transcriptional networks change dynamically during pattern formation. Studies from Drosophila and now also vertebrates suggest that transcriptional network dynamics are central to the generation of gene expression patterns.

This seminal fluid is transferred together with the spermatozoa during mating and induces post-mating changes in the female. Molecular characterization of seminal fluid proteins in the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, is limited, although studies suggest that some of these proteins are biologically active.Methodology/Principal Findings: We report on the functional annotation of 5914 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the testes and male accessory glands, to identify transcripts encoding putative secreted peptides that might elicit post-mating responses in females. The ESTs were assembled into 3344 contigs, of which over 33% produced no hits against the nr database, and thus may represent novel or rapidly evolving sequences. Extraction of the coding sequences resulted in a total of 3371 putative peptides. The annotated dataset is available as a hyperlinked spreadsheet. Four hundred peptides were identified with putative secretory activity, including odorant binding proteins, protease inhibitor domain-containing peptides, antigen 5 proteins, mucins, and immunity-related sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR-based analyses of a subset of putative secretory protein-encoding transcripts from accessory glands indicated changes in their abundance after one or more copulations when compared to virgin males of the same age. These changes in abundance, particularly evident after the third mating, may be related to the requirement to replenish proteins to be transferred to the female.Conclusions/Significance: We have developed the first large-scale dataset for novel studies on functions and processes associated with the reproductive biology of Ceratitis capitata. The identified genes may help study genome evolution, in light of the high adaptive potential of the medfly.

The species has a wide geographic distribution from Central America, northern and western South America to Amazonia and Bolivia, and is morphologically variable. All subspecies occur in the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke just outside Manaus, Amazonas State in Brazil, and it can be questioned how they can grow in sympatry and retain their identity. We have studied vegetative variation, flower morphology and, to some degree, reproductive barriers. The species is dioecious, has five-merous, cream to greenish flowers that produce pollen, nectar and scent to attract pollinators. The flowering period is between June and October, and the plants set fruits, one seed in each, between November and April. There was no overlap in flowering period in the study area between two of the presumed subspecies, but both have similar floral morphology and are pollinated by the same species of butterflies and bees. Weare not able to find any clear distributional or morphological discontinuities between the subspecies and we, therefore, suggest that M. guyanensis should be considered a variable species without formally recognised subspecies. Flowers of M. guyanensis are highly ephemeral and persist only for 1 day (similar to 27 h) before falling to the ground.

Twelve animals with skin depigmentation and ulceration were received by the Aquatic Pathology Service, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA, for diagnostic evaluation. Microscopically, lesions in 11 seahorses included multifocal epithelial necrosis and ulceration associated with 2 to 7 mu m diameter, branching, septate fungal hyphae, typically accompanied by deeper infiltration into underlying skeletal muscle. Angioinvasion, with vascular thrombosis and tissue infarction, was a prominent feature in multiple animals. Fungal invasion of one or more internal organs was observed in 4 animals. Hyphae appeared to course freely through tissues and elicited little or no inflammatory response. Fusariosis has been reported sporadically in fish and other aquatic organisms, but identification has often been limited to the genus level based solely on morphologic features. Morphologic characteristics of the fungus isolated from this case were consistent with the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), which includes over 50 members that can only be identified definitively using DNA sequence data. A 3-locus typing scheme identified the isolate as a distinct species/haplotype, designated FSSC 12-a, belonging to a specific lineage that appears adapted to aquatic environments and disease in marine animals. Empirical treatment with itraconazole failed to stop mortalities, and subsequent in vitro antifungal susceptibility data explained a lack of clinical efficacy for this agent.

However, there is scant information available on the biology of these important parasites in aquaculture. The population structure, sex ratio, and breeding status were determined for the pea crab Nepinnotheres novaezelandiae residing in a typical green-lipped mussel Perna canaliculus farm in New Zealand. Of the 324 crabs randomly sampled, there were significantly more female (82.4%) than male (17.6%) crabs found. The vast majority of crabs (87.0%) were sexually mature and of these, females comprised 86.4% and males 13.6%. However, the sex ratio of immature crabs was relatively even, suggesting that male crabs may have higher mortality while searching for mates. Crab size was highly variable, indicating that recruitment to mussels in the farm was continuous. Carapace width ranged from 4.00 to 11.5 mm, with males tending to be smaller with a mean (+/- SE) carapace width of 6.31 +/- 0.16 mm versus females with a carapace width of 8.03 +/- 0.06 mm. The crabs did not show any preference for parasitizing mussels of different sexes. Despite the fact that the mussels were only 10 mo old, most female crabs were sexually mature (Stage V) and 89.3% were gravid. The mean (+/- SE) clutch size was 2592 +/- 579 and clutch size was directly associated with female carapace width. The mussel farm pea crab population was estimated at 126 390 +/- 14 144 individuals, including 93 000 gravid females carrying a total of over 241 million eggs. Overall, the results show that pea crabs rapidly colonize farmed mussels and mature quickly to establish a significant breeding population within the mussel farm, with larval output capable of infecting nearby mussel farms as well as wild populations of bivalves.

They are thus expected to play key roles in the biology of Trypanosomatid parasites, which display complex life cycles and use extracellular cues to modulate cell differentiation. Despite their relevance, structural data of Trypanosomatid MAPKs is lacking. We have now determined the crystal structure of Leishmania major LmaMPK10, a stage-specifically activated MAPK, both alone and in complex with SB203580. LmaMPK10 was observed to be more similar to p38 than to other human MAPKs. However, significant differences could be identified in the catalytic pocket, as well as in potentially regulatory sites in the N-terminal lobe. The modified pocket architecture in LmaMPK10 precludes DFG-in/DFG-out regulatory flipping as observed in mammalian MAPKs. LmaMPK10-nucleotide association was also studied, revealing a potential C-terminal autoinhibitory mechanism. Overall, these data should speed the discovery of molecules interfering with LmaMPK10 functions, with relevance for antileishmanial drug development strategies.

Water-soluble and exfoliated His6-tagSWNTs are prepared and fully characterized. This functional molecular module is able to interact via robust physisorption (p-p stacking) with the sidewall of SWNTs and combines the versatility of small, water-soluble reporters (His6) for hierarchical directed self-assembly (HDSA) and construction of nanocomposites. It is demonstrated that metal coordination bonds with Ni(II) can be used for the supramolecular self assembly of His6-tagSWNTs, generating complex reticulated networks and architectures. The His6-tagSWNTs hard template nanohybrid is further utilized for directed self-assembly with silica nanoparticles. The versatility of the novel hybrids opens a new era for the rational design, smart (bio)functionalization, processing, interfacing, and self assembling of carbon nanotubes for the construction of multicomposites and more complex systems with controllable spatial organization and programmable properties for a wide range of applications in biology, nanoelectronics, and catalysis.

An ideal system would allow facile spatiotemporal manipulation of gene expression within a cell population that is tunable, reversible, repeatable, and can be targeted to diverse DNA sequences. To meet these criteria, a gene regulation system was engineered that combines light-sensitive proteins and programmable zinc finger transcription factors. This system, light-inducible transcription using engineered zinc finger proteins (LITEZ), uses two light-inducible dimerizing proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, GIGANTEA and the LOV domain of FKF1, to control synthetic zinc finger transcription factor activity in human cells. Activation of gene expression in human cells engineered with LITEZ was reversible and repeatable by modulating the duration of illumination. The level of gene expression could also be controlled by modulating light intensity. Finally, gene expression could be activated in a spatially defined pattern by illuminating the human cell culture through a photomask of arbitrary geometry. LITEZ enables new approaches for precisely regulating gene expression in biotechnology and medicine, as well as studying gene function, cell-cell interactions, and tissue morphogenesis.

Here, we use a combination of low-temperature electronic absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, resonance Raman, and S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopies to investigate a series of second-sphere variants-F114P, N47S, and F114N in Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin-which modulate hydrogen bonding to and protein-derived dipoles nearby the Cu-S(Cys) bond. Density functional theory calculations correlated to the experimental data allow for the fractionation of the contributions to tuning E-0 into covalent and nonlocal electrostatic components. These are found to be significant, comparable in magnitude, and additive for active H-bonds, while passive H-bonds are mostly nonlocal electrostatic in nature. For dipoles, these terms can be additive to or oppose one another. This study provides a methodology for uncoupling covalency from nonlocal electrostatics, which, when coupled to X-ray crystallographic data, distinguishes specific local interactions from more long-range protein/active interactions, while affording further insight into the second-sphere mechanisms available to the protein to tune the E-0 of electron-transfer sites in biology.

However, the structure of these products, which informs their reactivity in biology, has not been unequivocally established. We report here the complete characterization of the products formed in the addition of superoxide, generated from xanthine oxidase, to several peptide-derived tyrosyl radicals, formed from horseradish peroxidase. RP-HPLC, LC-MS, and NMR experiments indicate that the primary stable products of superoxide addition to tyrosyl radical are para-hydroperwdde derivatives (para relative to the position of the OH in tyrosine) that can be reduced to the corresponding para-alcohol. In the case of glycyl-tyrosine, a stable 3-(1-hydroperoxy-4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-yl)-L-alanine was formed. In tyrosyl-glycine and Leu-enkephalin, which have N-terminal tyrosines, bicyclic indolic para-hydroperoxide derivatives were formed ((2S,3aR,7aR)-3a-hydroperoxy-6-oxo-2,3,3a,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid) by the conjugate addition of the free amine to the cyclohexadienone. It was also found that significant amounts of the para-OH derivative were generated from the hydroxyl radical, formed on exposure of tyrosine-containing peptides to Fenton conditions. The para-OOH and para-OH derivatives are much more reactive than other tyrosine oxidation products and may play important roles in physiology and disease.

The fabrication of an arbitrary number of identical copies of the region hit by the firing pin and by the breech face is described. The replicas can be (i) handled without damaging the original evidence, (ii) distributed to different law enforcement agencies for comparison against other evidences found on crime scenes or ballistic tests of seized firearms, (iii) maintained on a file by the laboratories. A detailed analysis of the morphological features of the replicas has been carried out by standard microscopy techniques as well as by advanced microscopy such as scanning probe and scanning electron leading to a quantitative morphological characterization of the case heads down to the nanometer scale.

These limitations are severe in developing countries where the lack of resources restricts the potential for basic ecological research. One way in which this limitation has been mitigated is with the use of individual-based spatially explicit population models (SEPMs). We developed a SEPM for the endangered huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) of southern Chile. The goal was to project the population trajectories under three different development scenarios (present conditions, increased livestock density and hydroelectric dams) in southern Chile, identifying key demographic variables associated to landscape features. The model simulated weekly movements, age and general status of all individuals in the population and the landscape in which they lived during a 40-year period. Age-dependent and landscape-related mortality probabilities were applied. Four population sizes and three spatial aggregation patterns were used as initial conditions. Although the model was very sensitive to age-dependent mortality rate, individual landscape perception scale and initial population size and location, the general trend was that of a positive population growth. Livestock and dam scenarios had minimal impacts on population dynamics. Most simulations starting with 100 individuals resulted in extinctions and disaggregated initial location of individuals produced slow rates of population growth, suggesting the existence of a population viability threshold. Our results suggest that the huemul population in the Aysen region has the potential to recover only if limiting factors are kept under control and they highlight the urgency of conducting studies aimed at estimating total population size and distribution together with survival data to improve the conservation plans for this endangered species.

Given a set of genotypes, the haplotype inference problem based on pure parsimony is the problem of finding a minimum set of haplotypes that explains all the given genotypes. The problem is especially important because, while it is fairly inexpensive to obtain genotypes, other approaches to obtaining haplotypes are significantly expensive. There are two types of methods proposed for the problem, namely exact and inexact methods. Existing exact methods guarantee obtaining purely parsimonious solutions but have exponential time-complexities and are not practical for large number or length of genotypes. However, inexact methods are relatively fast but do not always obtain optimum solutions. In this paper, an improved heuristic is proposed, based on which new inexact and exact methods are provided. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods replace the state-of-the-art inexact and exact methods for the problem. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In early development, embryonic morphogenesis results largely from monolayer rearrangement and deformation due to internally generated forces. Later, monolayers act as physical barriers separating the internal environment from the exterior and must withstand externally applied forces. Though resisting and generating mechanical forces is an essential part of monolayer function, simple experimental methods to characterize monolayer mechanical properties are lacking. Here, we describe a system for tensile testing of freely suspended cultured monolayers that enables the examination of their mechanical behavior at multi-, uni-, and subcellular scales. Using this system, we provide measurements of monolayer elasticity and show that this is two orders of magnitude larger than the elasticity of their isolated cellular components. Monolayers could withstand more than a doubling in length before failing through rupture of intercellular junctions. Measurement of stress at fracture enabled a first estimation of the average force needed to separate cells within truly mature monolayers, approximately ninefold larger than measured in pairs of isolated cells. As in single cells, monolayer mechanical properties were strongly dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, myosin, and intercellular adhesions interfacing adjacent cells. High magnification imaging revealed that keratin filaments became progressively stretched during extension, suggesting they participate in monolayer mechanics. This multiscale study of monolayer response to deformation enabled by our device provides the first quantitative investigation of the link between monolayer biology and mechanics.

Acyl-homoserine lactones serve as quorum-sensing signals for many Proteobacteria, and acyl-homoserine lactone signaling is known to control cooperative activities. Quorum-controlled activities vary from one species to another. Quorum-sensing controls a constellation of genes in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which thrives in a number of habitats ranging from soil and water to animal hosts. We hypothesized that there would be significant variation in quorum-sensing regulons among strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from different habitats and that differences in the quorum-sensing regulons might reveal insights about the ecology of P. aeruginosa. As a test of our hypothesis we used RNA-seq to identify quorum-controlled genes in seven P. aeruginosa isolates of diverse origins. Although our approach certainly overlooks some quorum-sensing-regulated genes we found a shared set of genes, i.e., a core quorum-controlled gene set, and we identified distinct, strain-variable sets of quorum-controlled genes, i.e., accessory genes. Some quorum-controlled genes in some strains were not present in the genomes of other strains. We detected a correlation between traits encoded by some genes in the strain-variable subsets of the quorum regulons and the ecology of the isolates. These findings indicate a role for quorum sensing in extension of the range of habitats in which a species can thrive. This study also provides a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which quorum-sensing systems operate, the evolutionary pressures by which they are maintained, and their importance in disparate ecological contexts.

This system was compared to a strategy combining an extraction step on the NUCLISENS easyMAG platform (bioMerieux) with the CMV R-gene kit (Argene) on 100 whole blood specimens collected from immunocompromised patients of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, France.Results: The overall agreement between the two strategies was 86% (kappa coefficient of 0.67); the 14 discrepant results corresponded to low DNA loads. The 62 samples found positive with both tests were correlated (Pearson r coefficient of 0.70, P < 0.01) despite an over quantitation of 0.25 log(10) copies/ml with the easyMAG/Argene strategy (P < 0.001). Very close results were also obtained with a commercial panel of 10 samples with CMV loads ranging from 2.36 to 6.41 log(10) copies/ml.

We have tested the hypothesis that inulin-type fructans (ITF), by promoting microbial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), influence cancer cell proliferation outside the gut.METHODS: Mice transplanted with Bcr-Abl-transfected BaF3 cells, received ITF in their drinking water. Gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and qPCR. Serum Short-chain fatty acids were quantified by UHPLC-MS. Cell proliferation was evaluated in vivo, by molecular biology and histology, and in vitro.RESULTS: Inulin-type fructans treatment reduces hepatic BaF3 cell infiltration, lessens inflammation and increases portal propionate concentration. In vitro, propionate reduces BaF3 cell growth through a cAMP level-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the activation of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2), a Gi/Gq-protein-coupled receptor also known as GPR43 and that binds propionate, lessens the proliferation of BaF3 and other human cancer cell lines.CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that the fermentation of nutrients such as ITF into propionate can counteract malignant cell proliferation in the liver tissue. Our results support the interest of FFA2 activation as a new strategy for cancer therapeutics.

Single-gene analyses may not reliably predict biology of PC because of its complex molecular makeup. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling may provide a more informative molecular interrogation of tumours. The primary objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of performing miRNA arrays and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell blocks obtained from fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) that is the commonest diagnostic procedure for suspected PC.METHODS: MicroRNA expression profiling was performed on FFPE from FNA of suspicious pancreatic masses. Subjects included those who had a pathological diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and others with a non-malignant pancreatic histology. Exiqon assay was used to quantify miRNA levels and qRT-PCR was used to validate abnormal expression of selected miRNAs.RESULTS: A total of 29 and 15 subjects had pancreatic adenocarcinoma and no evidence of cancer, respectively. The RNA yields per patient varied from 25 to 100 ng. Profiling demonstrated deregulation of over 228 miRNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma of which the top 7 were further validated by qRT-PCR. The expression of let-7c, let-7 f, and miR-200c were significantly reduced in most patients whereas the expression of miR-486-5p and miR-451 were significantly elevated in all pancreas cancer patients.

Here, we addressed whether analyses of tumour mRNA at the exon level can improve on the predictive power and classification accuracy of gene-based expression profiles using neuroblastoma as a model.METHODS: In a patient cohort comprising 113 primary neuroblastoma specimens expression profiling using exon-level analyses was performed to define predictive signatures using various machine-learning techniques. Alternative transcript use was calculated from relative exon expression. Validation of alternative transcripts was achieved using qPCR- and cell-based approaches.RESULTS: Both predictors derived from the gene or the exon levels resulted in prediction accuracies >80% for both event-free and overall survival and proved as independent prognostic markers in multivariate analyses. Alternative transcript use was most prominently linked to the amplification status of the MYCN oncogene, expression of the TrkA/NTRK1 neurotrophin receptor and survival.CONCLUSION: As exon level-based prediction yields comparable, but not significantly better, prediction accuracy than gene expression-based predictors, gene-based assays seem to be sufficiently precise for predicting outcome of neuroblastoma patients. However, exon-level analyses provide added knowledge by identifying alternative transcript use, which should deepen the understanding of neuroblastoma biology.

For instance, the strength of selection on a cognitive trait has never been estimated in a natural population, and the possibility that positive links with life history variation [1-5] are mitigated by costs [6] or confounded by ecological factors remains unexplored in the wild. We assessed novel problem-solving performance in 468 wild great tits Parus major temporarily taken into captivity and subsequently followed up their reproductive performance in the wild. Problem-solver females produced larger clutches than non-solvers. This benefit did not arise because solvers timed their breeding better, occupied better habitats, or compromised offspring quality or their own survival. Instead, foraging range size and day length were relatively small and short, respectively, for solvers, suggesting that they were more efficient at exploiting their environment. In contrast to the positive effect on clutch size, problem solvers deserted their nests more often, leading to little or no overall selection on problem-solving performance. Our results are consistent with the idea that variation in cognitive ability is shaped by contrasting effects on different life history traits directly linked to fitness [1,3].

Based on an understanding of evolutionary biology, developmental plasticity, and life history theory, one can predict that stressors are an important environmental condition that may influence brain development. In fact, the available empirical evidence appears to support the notion that exposure to excess stress in intrauterine life has the potential to adversely affect short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes with implications for altered susceptibility for mental health disorders in childhood and adult life. In this presentation, we provide a rationale for proposing that endocrine and inflammatory stress mediators are key candidate pathways for programming brain development. These mediators are responsive to a diverse set of intrauterine perturbations and alter key signaling pathways critical for brain development, including but not limited to mammalian target of rapamycin, Wnt (wingless), Sonic hedgehog, and reelin signaling. We suggest that recent advances in neuroimaging and other methods now afford us an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of this important topic. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence from two recently published papers for fetal programming of human brain development.

Because of the dominant importance of surface effects at the nanoscale, long-standing assumptions that are valid for macroscopic systems must be revisited when modeling nanoconfined fluids, because boundary conditions and the confined behavior of liquids are challenging to discern from experiments. To address this issue, here we present a novel coarse-grained model that combines parameters calibrated for water with a dissipative particle dynamics thermostat for the purpose of investigating hydrodynamics under confinement at scales exceeding current capabilities with all-atomistic simulations. Conditions pertaining to slip boundary conditions and confinement emerge naturally from particle interactions, with no need for assumptions a priori. The model is used to systematically investigate the imbibition dynamics of water into cylindrical nanopores of different diameters. Interestingly, we find that the dynamic contact angle depends on the size of the nanopore in a way that cannot be explained through a relationship between contact line velocity and dynamic contact angle, suggesting nonlocal effects of the flow field may be important. Additionally, a size-dependent characteristic time scale for imbibition is found, which could be useful for the interpretation of experiments and design of novel nanofluidic devices. We present the first systematic study that explains how contact angle dynamics and imbibition dynamics vary with nanopore radius. Our modeling approach lays the foundation for broader investigations on the dynamics of fluids in nanoporous materials in conjunction with experimental efforts.

Conventional and linear multivariate models have limited use for quantitative and qualitative investigations of such systems because they are based on the assumption that the measured data are simple superpositions of several input parameters. 'Predictor Surfaces were developed for studies of more chemically complex systems such as biological materials in order to ensure accurate quantitative analyses and proper chemical modeling for in-depth studies of such systems. Predictor Surfaces are based on approximating nonlinear multivariate model functions by multivariate Taylor expansions which inherently introduce the required coupled and higher-order predictor variables.As proof-of-principle for the Predictor Surfaces' capabilities, an application from environmental analytical chemistry was chosen. Microalgae cells are known to sensitively adapt to changes in environmental parameters such as pollution and/or nutrient availability and thus have potential as novel in situ sensors for environmental monitoring. These adaptations of the microalgae cells are reflected in their chemical signatures which were then acquired by means of FT-IR spectroscopy. In this study, the concentrations of three nutrients, namely inorganic carbon and two nitrogen containing ions, were chosen. Biological considerations predict that changes in nutrient availability produce a nonlinear response in the cells' biomass composition; it is also known that microalgae need certain nutrient mixes to thrive. The nonlinear Predictor Surfaces were demonstrated to be more accurate in predicting the values of these nutrients' concentrations than principal component regression. For qualitative chemical studies of biological systems, the Predictor Surfaces themselves are a novel tool as they visualize nonlinearities and more importantly the coupling among predictor variables. Thus, they can serve as a novel tool for studies in bioanalytical chemistry, biology, and ecology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was 1) to investigate application of PEG modified GMNPs (PGMNPs) as a drug carrier of the chemotherapy compound doxorubicin (DOX) in vitro; 2) to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of DOX-conjugated PGMNPs (DOX-PGMNPs) using an EMF-guided delivery in vivo.Methods: First, DOX-PGMNPs were synthesized and the cytotoxicity of DOX-PGMNPs was assessed in vitro. Second, upon intravenous administration of DOX-PMGPNs to H22 hepatoma cell tumor-bearing mice, the DOX biodistribution in different organs (tissues) was measured. The antitumor activity was evaluated using different treatment strategies such as DOX-PMGPNs or DOX-PMGPNs with an EMF-guided delivery (DOX-PGMNPs-M).Results: The relative tumor volumes in DOX-PGMNPs-M, DOX-PGMNPs, and DOX groups were 5.46 +/- 1.48, 9.22 +/- 1.51, and 14.8 +/- 1.64, respectively (each p < 0.05), following treatment for 33 days. The life span of tumor-bearing mice treated with DOX-PGMNPs-M, DOX-PGMNPs, and DOX were 74.8 +/- 9.95, 66.1 +/- 13.5 +/- 13.5, and 31.3 +/- 3.31 days, respectively (each p < 0.05).Conclusion: This simple and adaptive nanoparticle design may accommodate chemotherapy for drug delivery optimization and in vivo drug-target definition in system biology profiling, increasing the margin of safety in treatment of cancers in the near future.

In prostate cancer, aggressive cases over-express Tip60 which functions as an androgen receptor co-activator via direct acetylation of lysine residues within the KLKK motif of the receptor hinge region. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterise a Tip60 acetylase inhibitor. High-throughput screening revealed an isothiazole that inhibited both Tip60 and p300 HAT activity. This substance (initially identified as 4-methyl-5-bromoisothiazole) and other isothiazoles were synthesised and assayed against Tip60. Although an authentic sample of 4-methyl-5-bromoisothiazole was inactive against Tip60, in an in vitro HAT assay, 1,2-bis(isothiazol-5-yl)disulfane (NU9056) was identified as a relatively potent inhibitor (IC50 2 mu M). Cellular activity was confirmed by analysis of acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins in a prostate cancer cell line model. NU9056 treatment inhibited cellular proliferation in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines (50% growth inhibition, 8-27 mu M) and induced apoptosis via activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 in a concentration-and time-dependent manner. Also, decreased androgen receptor, prostate specific antigen, p53 and p21 protein levels were demonstrated in response to treatment with NU9056. Furthermore, pre-treatment with NU9056 inhibited both ATM phosphorylation and Tip60 stabilization in response to ionising radiation. Based on the activity of NU9056 and the specificity of the compound towards Tip60 relative to other HAT enzymes, these chemical biology studies have identified Tip60 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.

In an attempt to identify and profile the population of ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients, a novel method was developed to separate adherent (AD) and non-adherent (NAD) cells in culture. Twenty-five patients were recruited to this study; 11 chemonaive (CN) and 14 chemoresistant (CR). AD cells from both CN and CR patients exhibited mesenchymal morphology with an antigen profile of mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. Conversely, NAD cells had an epithelial morphology with enhanced expression of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and cytokeratin 7. NAD cells developed infiltrating tumors and ascites within 12-14 weeks after intraperitoneal (i.p.)injections into nude mice, whereas AD cells remained non-tumorigenic for up to 20 weeks. Subsequent comparison of selective epithelial, mesenchymal and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers between AD and NAD populations of CN and CR patients demonstrated an enhanced trend in mRNA expression of E-cadherin, EpCAM, STAT3 and Oct4 in the NAD population of CR patients. A similar trend of enhanced mRNA expression of CD44, MMP9 and Oct4 was observed in the AD population of CR patients. Hence, using a novel purification method we demonstrate for the first time a distinct separation of ascites cells into epithelial tumorigenic and mesenchymal non-tumorigenic populations. We also demonstrate that cells from the ascites of CR patients are predominantly epithelial and show a trend towards increased mRNA expression of genes associated with CSCs, compared to cells isolated from the ascites of CN patients. As the tumor cells in the ascites of ovarian cancer patients play a dominant role in disease recurrence, a thorough understanding of the biology of the ascites microenvironment from CR and CN patients is essential for effective therapeutic interventions.

Drought stress response involves a large number of molecular pathways and subsequent physiological processes. Therefore, it constitutes an archetypical systems biology model. We first inferred a gene-phenotype network exploiting differences in drought responses of eight sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genotypes to two drought stress scenarios. Large transcriptomic data were obtained with the sunflower Affymetrix microarray, comprising 32423 probesets, and were associated to nine morpho-physiological traits (integrated transpired water, leaf transpiration rate, osmotic potential, relative water content, leaf mass per area, carbon isotope discrimination, plant height, number of leaves and collar diameter) using sPLS regression. Overall, we could associate the expression patterns of 1263 probesets to six phenotypic traits and identify if correlations were due to treatment, genotype and/or their interaction. We also identified genes whose expression is affected at moderate and/or intense drought stress together with genes whose expression variation could explain phenotypic and drought tolerance variability among our genetic material. We then used the network model to study phenotypic changes in less tractable agronomical conditions, i.e. sunflower hybrids subjected to different watering regimes in field trials. Mapping this new dataset in the gene-phenotype network allowed us to identify genes whose expression was robustly affected by water deprivation in both controlled and field conditions. The enrichment in genes correlated to relative water content and osmotic potential provides evidence of the importance of these traits in agronomical conditions.

Despite their importance, mutation rates are some of the most elusive parameters to measure in evolutionary biology. The combination of mutation accumulation (MA) experiments and whole-genome sequencing now makes it possible to estimate mutation rates by directly observing new mutations at the molecular level across the whole genome. We performed an MA experiment with the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and sequenced the genomes of three randomly chosen lines using high-throughput sequencing to estimate the spontaneous mutation rate in this model organism. The mitochondrial mutation rate of 6.76x10(-9), with a Poisson confidence interval of 4.1x10(-9) -9.5x10(-9), per nucleotide per generation is slightly lower than estimates for other taxa. The mutation rate estimate for the nuclear DNA of 2.9x10(-11), with a Poisson confidence interval ranging from 7.4x10(-13) to 1.6x10(-10), is the lowest reported for any eukaryote. These results are consistent with low microsatellite mutation rates previously observed in D. discoideum and low levels of genetic variation observed in wild D. discoideum populations. In addition, D. discoideum has been shown to be quite resistant to DNA damage, which suggests an efficient DNA-repair mechanism that could be an adaptation to life in soil and frequent exposure to intracellular and extracellular mutagenic compounds. The social aspect of the life cycle of D. discoideum and a large portion of the genome under relaxed selection during vegetative growth could also select for a low mutation rate. This hypothesis is supported by a significantly lower mutation rate per cell division in multicellular eukaryotes compared with unicellular eukaryotes.

The latest subfamily called ""GECOs"" were developed with in vitro high-throughput screening, and shown to have novel spectral properties and/or improved fluorescent responses over their ancestor GCaMP3. The most critical parameter in evaluating performance in neurons, however, remains uncharacterized: the relationship between the GECI responses and the number of action potentials (APs). Here we analyzed the GECI responses to APs in cortical pyramidal cells of mouse acute brain slices. Unexpectedly, we found that none of the GECOs exhibited any improved performance over GCaMP3. Our results imply that careful validation is required for the accurate prediction of the actual performance of GECIs in mammalian neurons. We propose that appropriate guidelines for evaluating their efficacy should be established for the benefit of research community, given the rapidly expanding use of GECIs in neuroscience.

The most frequent mutations in this gene, point substitutions in codons 12 and 13, were validated as negative predictors of response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. Therefore, determining the KRAS mutational status of tumor samples has become an essential tool for managing patients with colorectal cancers. Currently, a variety of detection methods have been established to analyze the mutation status in the key regions of the KRAS gene; however, several challenges remain related to standardized and uniform testing, including the selection of tumor samples, tumor sample processing and optimal testing methods. Moreover, new testing strategies, in combination with the mutation analysis of BRAF, PIK3CA and loss of PTEN proposed by many researchers and pathologists, should be promoted. In addition, we recommend that microsatellite instability, a prognostic factor, be added to the abovementioned concomitant analysis. This review provides an overview of KRAS biology and the recent advances in KRAS mutation testing. This review also addresses other aspects of status testing for determining the appropriate treatment and offers insight into the potential drawbacks of mutational testing. (C) 2012 Baishideng.

Recent developments in bioluminescent imaging (BLI) allow direct in vivo imaging of neurogenesis, and in order to interpret the experimental results, mathematical models are necessary. This study proposes such a mathematical model that describes adult mammalian neurogenesis occurring in the subventricular zone and the subsequent migration of cells through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (OB). This model assumes that a single chemoattractant is responsible for cell migration, secreted both by the OB and in an endocrine fashion by the cells involved in neurogenesis. The solutions to the system of partial differential equations are compared with the physiological rodent process, as previously documented in the literature and quantified through the use of BLI, and a parameter space is described, the corresponding solution to which matches that of the rodent model. A sensitivity analysis shows that this parameter space is stable to perturbation and furthermore that the system as a whole is sloppy. A large number of parameter sets are stochastically generated, and it is found that parameter spaces corresponding to physiologically plausible solutions generally obey constraints similar to the conditions reported in vivo. This further corroborates the model and its underlying assumptions based on the current understanding of the investigated phenomenon. Concomitantly, this leaves room for further quantitative predictions pertinent to the design of future proposed experiments.

Our approach allows us to perform model selection over a selection of potential network growth models. The methodology we apply uses a distance defined in terms of graph spectra which captures the network data more naturally than previously used summary statistics such as the degree distribution. Furthermore, we include the effects of sampling into the analysis, to properly correct for the incompleteness of existing datasets, and have analysed the performance of our method under various degrees of sampling. We consider a number of models focusing not only on the biologically relevant class of duplication models, but also including models of scale-free network growth that have previously been claimed to describe such data. We find a preference for a duplication-divergence with linear preferential attachment model in the majority of the interaction datasets considered.

In biology, a number of fine properties of bistability have been identified. However, these properties are only consequences of bistability at the physiological level, which do not explain why it had to emerge during evolution. Using optimal homeostasis as the first principle, I find that bistability emerges as an indispensable control mechanism. It is the only solution to a dilemma in glucose homeostasis: high insulin efficiency is required to confer rapidness in plasma glucose clearance, whereas an insulin sparing state is required to guarantee the brain's safety during fasting. The optimality consideration renders a clear correspondence between the molecular and physiological levels. This new perspective can illuminate studies on the twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes and the corresponding intervening strategies. For example, overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle may represent sudden environmental changes that cause the lose of optimality, which may contribute to the marked rise of obesity and diabetes in our generation. Because this bistability result is independent of the parameters of the mathematicalmodel (for which the result is quite general), some other biological systems may also use bistability to control homeostasis.

At present no theory satisfactorily explains the origin of the hair cycle rhythm. Based on experimental evidence we propose a prototypic model that focuses on the dynamics of hair matrix keratinocytes. We argue that a plausible feedback-control structure between two key compartments (matrix keratinocytes and dermal papilla) leads to dynamic instabilities in the population dynamics resulting in rhythmic hair growth. The underlying oscillation consists of an autonomous switching between two quasi-steady states. Additional features of the model, namely bistability and excitability, lead to new hypotheses about the impact of interventions on hair growth. We show how in silico testing may facilitate testing of candidate hair growth modulatory agents in human HF organ culture or in clinical trials. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we introduce a novel network-based method to identify highly predictive biomarker candidates for disease. First, we infer two different types of networks: (i) correlation networks, and (ii) a new type of network called ratio networks. Based on these networks, we introduce scores to prioritize features using topological descriptors of the vertices. To evaluate our method we use an example dataset where quantitative targeted MS/MS analysis was applied to a total of 52 blood samples from 22 persons with obesity (BMI > 30) and 30 healthy controls. Using our network-based feature selection approach we identified highly discriminating metabolites for obesity (F-score > 0.85, accuracy > 85%), some of which could be verified by the literature.

If the driving forces of extinction change through time, this assumption may be unrealistic. Testing the consistency of extinction patterns between the past and the present has been difficult, because the phylogenetically explicit methods used to model present-day extinction risk typically cannot be applied to the data from the fossil record. However, the detailed historical and fossil records of the New Zealand avifauna provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct a complete, large faunal assemblage for different periods in the past. Using the first complete phylogeny of all known native New Zealand bird species, both extant and extinct, we show how the taxonomic and phylogenetic selectivity of extinction, and biological correlates of extinction, change from the pre-human period through Polynesian and European occupation, to the present. These changes can be explained both by changes in primary threatening processes, and by the operation of extinction filter effects. The variable patterns of extinction through time may confound attempts to identify risk factors that apply across time periods, and to infer future species declines from past extinction patterns and current threat status.

Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) populations have significantly declined due to overexploitation. As a consequence of their value and population decline, T. thynnus has been the focus of considerable research effort concerning many aspects of their life history. However, in-depth understanding of T. thynnus reproductive biology is still lacking. Knowledge of reproductive physiology is a very important tool for determining effective fisheries and aquaculture management. Transcriptome techniques are proving powerful and provide novel insights into physiological processes. Construction of a microarray from T. thynnus ESTs sourced from reproductive tissues has provided an ideal platform to study the reproductive physiology of bluefin tunas. The aim of this investigation was to compare transcription profiles from the ovaries and testes of mature T. thynnus to establish sex specific variations underlying their reproductive physiology.Results: Male and females T. thynnus gonad tissues were collected from the wild and histologically staged. Sub-samples of sexually mature tissues were also measured for their mRNA differential expression among the sexes using the custom microarray design BFT 4X44K. A total of 7068 ESTs were assessed for differential expression of which 1273 ESTs were significantly different (p<0.05) with >2 fold change in expression according to sex. Differential expression for 13 of these ESTs was validated with quantitative PCR. These include genes involved in egg envelope formation, hydration, and lipid transport/accumulation more highly expressed in ovaries compared with testis, while genes involved in meiosis, sperm motility and lipid metabolism were more highly expressed in testis compared with ovaries.Conclusions: This investigation has furthered our knowledge of bluefin tunas reproductive biology by using a contemporary transcriptome approach.

We recently reported that both isoforms of TFPI induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of cancer cells. The signaling pathway(s) mediating the effects of TFPI is, however, presently still unclear. Our goal was to further investigate the cellular processes affected by TFPI and to get insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of TFPI, using a global gene expression study approach. TFPI alpha or TFPI beta cDNA were transfected into SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells for stable overexpression. Global mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expressions were measured and functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs according to gene ontology terms was conducted. Selected results were validated using qRT-PCR and Western blot. A total of 242 and 801 mRNA transcripts and 120 and 46 miRNAs were differentially expressed in cells overexpressing TFPI alpha or TFPI beta, respectively. Overexpression of either isoform significantly affected the expression of genes involved in cell development (apoptosis, cell movement, migration, invasion, colony formation, growth, and adhesion) and immune response. Network analyses revealed biological interactions between these genes and implied that several of the genes may be involved in both processes. The expression profiles also correlated significantly with clinical phenotype and outcome. Functional cluster analyses indicated altered activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor, small GTPases, and the NF-kappa B and JAK/STAT cascades when TFPI was overexpressed, and increased activity of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and Elk-1 and phospho-Akt levels was observed. Integrated mRNA-miRNA analyses showed that 19% and 32% of the differentially expressed genes in cells overexpressing TFPI alpha or TFPI beta, respectively, may have been regulated by miRNAs.

Glucocorticoids are potent enhancers of IL-7R alpha expression with diverse roles in T cell biology. Here we identify the transcriptional repressor, growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1), as a novel intermediary in glucocorticoid-induced IL-7R alpha up-regulation. We found Gfi1 to be a major inhibitory target of dexamethasone by microarray expression profiling of 3B4.15 T-hybridoma cells. Concordantly, retroviral transduction of Gfi1 significantly blunted IL-7R alpha up-regulation by dexamethasone. To further assess the role of Gfi1 in vivo, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice, in which a modified Il7r locus expresses GFP to report Il7r gene transcription. By introducing this BAC reporter transgene into either Gfi1-deficient or Gfi1-transgenic mice, we document in vivo that IL-7R alpha transcription is up-regulated in the absence of Gfi1 and down-regulated when Gfi1 is overexpressed. Strikingly, the in vivo regulatory role of Gfi1 was specific for CD8(+), and not CD4(+) T cells or immature thymocytes. These results identify Gfi1 as a specific transcriptional repressor of the Il7r gene in CD8 T lymphocytes in vivo.

However, the frequent requirement of peptide folding in specific interactions of IDPs could impose a kinetic bottleneck, which could be overcome only by efficient folding upon encounter. Intriguingly, existing kinetic data suggest that specific binding of IDPs is generally no slower than that of globular proteins. Here, we exploited the cell cycle regulator p27(KiP1) (p27) as a model system to understand how IDPs might achieve efficient folding upon encounter for facile recognition. Combining experiments and coarse-grained modeling, we demonstrate that long-range electrostatic interactions between enriched charges on p27 and near its binding site on cyclin A not only enhance the encounter rate (i.e., electrostatic steering) but also promote folding-competent topologies in the encounter complexes, allowing rapid subsequent formation of short-range native interactions en route to the specific complex. In contrast, nonspecific hydrophobic interactions, while hardly affecting the encounter rate, can significantly reduce the efficiency of folding upon encounter and lead to slower binding kinetics. Further analysis of charge distributions in a set of known IDP complexes reveals that, although IDP binding sites tend to be more hydrophobic compared to the rest of the target surface, their vicinities are frequently enriched with charges to complement those on IDPs. This observation suggests that electrostatically accelerated encounter and induced folding might represent a prevalent mechanism for promoting facile IDP recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Some prominent theories propose sweeping domain-general characterizations of the difference in cognitive capabilities and/or mechanisms between adult humans and other animals. Dual-process theories for some cognitive domains propose that adult human cognition shares simple basic processes with that of other animals while additionally including slower-developing and more explicit uniquely human processes. These theories are consistent with a modular account of cognition and the 'core knowledge' account of children's cognitive development. A complementary proposal is that human infants have unique social and/or cognitive adaptations for uniquely human learning. A view of human cognitive architecture as a mosaic of unique and species-general modular and domain-general processes together with a focus on uniquely human developmental mechanisms is consistent with modern evolutionary-developmental biology and suggests new questions for comparative research.

The aim of this paper is to explore the expressive power of reaction systems as a modeling framework, showing how their basic assumptions and properties can be exploited to formalize computer science and biology oriented problems. In this view, we first provide a reaction-based description of an iterative algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Then, we show how the regulation of gene expression in the lac operon, involved in the metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coil cells, can be formalized in terms of reaction systems. Finally, we present a method to derive, given a reaction system with n reactions, a functionally equivalent system with n' <= n reactions using simplification methods of boolean expressions.

Several studies have assessed the molecular biology of the virus in this cell type, and a number of differences towards HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells have been described. There is a broad consensus that macrophages resist HIV-1 infection much better than CD4+ T cells. Among other reasons, this is due to the presence of the recently identified host cell restriction factor SamHD1, which is strongly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage. Furthermore, macrophages produce and release relatively low amounts of infectious HIV-1 and are less sensitive to viral cytotoxicity in comparison to CD4+ T cells. Nevertheless, macrophages play a crucial role in the different phases of HIV-1 infection. In this review, we summarize and discuss the significance of macrophages for HIV-1 transmission, the acute and chronic phases of HIV-1 infection, the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated diseases, including neurocognitive disorders. We propose that interaction of HIV-1 with macrophages is crucial during all stages of HIV-1 infection. Thus, long-term successful treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals requires potent strategies to prevent HIV-1 from entering and persisting in these cells.

The tropical and sub-tropical phytoplankton communities exhibited a wide range of responses to climate variability, from radical shifts in the Equatorial Pacific, to changes of only a couple of phytoplankton groups in the North Central Pacific, to no significant changes in the South Pacific. In the Equatorial Pacific, climate variability represented by ENSO dominated the variability of phytoplankton. Here, nitrate, chlorophyll and all of the 4 phytoplankton types (diatoms, cyanobacteria, chlorophytes and coccolithophores) were strongly correlated (p < 0.05) with the Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI). During La Nina events, diatoms increased and expanded westward along the cold tongue (correlation with MEI, r = -0.87, p < 0.05), while cyanobacteria concentrations decreased significantly (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). El Nino produced the reverse pattern, with cyanobacteria populations increasing while diatoms plummeted. In the North Central Pacific, the MEI was significantly correlated with diatoms (r = -0.40) and chlorophytes (r = -0.43). Ocean biology in the South Pacific was not significantly correlated with MEI. The phytoplankton composition from the assimilation model was compared to that from a new empirical algorithm using satellite data. Despite differences in the absolute concentration, the relative abundance from the model and the satellite-derived approach showed a similar shift in phytoplankton community in the Equatorial Pacific. These results highlight the spatially variable nature of the relationship between phytoplankton community structure and climate variability within the Pacific Ocean.

Low HDL and raised non-HDL cholesterol levels carried increased risk for heart failure development in the Framingham study, independent of any association with myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) number and function after lipid lowering or HDL raising gene transfer in C57BL/6 low density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDLr-/- 2) mice may be associated with an enhanced relative vascularity in the myocardium and an improved cardiac function.Methodology/principal findings: Lipid lowering and HDL raising gene transfer were performed using the E1E3E4-deleted LDLr expressing adenoviral vector AdLDLr and the human apolipoprotein A-I expressing vector AdA-I, respectively. AdLDLr transfer in C57BL/6 LDLr-/- mice resulted in a 2.0-fold (p<0.05) increase of the circulating number of EPCs and in an improvement of EPC function as assessed by ex vivo EPC migration and EPC adhesion. Capillary density and relative vascularity in the myocardium were 28% (p<0.01) and 22% (p<0.05) higher, respectively, in AdLDLr mice compared to control mice. The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 12% (p<0.05) and the time constant of isovolumetric relaxation was decreased by 14% (p<0.05) after AdLDLr transfer. Similarly, HDL raising gene transfer increased EPC number and function and raised both capillary density and relative vascularity in the myocardium by 24% (p<0.05). The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 16% (p<0.05) in AdA-I mice compared to control mice.Conclusions/Significance: Both lipid lowering and HDL raising gene transfer have beneficial effects on EPC biology, relative myocardial vascularity, and diastolic function. These findings raise concerns over the external validity of studies evaluating myocardial biology and cardiac repair in normocholesterolemic animals.

We have demonstrated the purification of adrenal cortical progenitor cells from digestions of murine adrenal glands utilizing hydrodynamic inertial lift forces that single cells and multicellular clusters differentially experience as they flow through a microchannel. Fluorescence staining, along with gene expression measurements, confirmed that populations of cells collected in different outlets were distinct from one another. Furthermore, primary murine cells processed through the device remained highly viable and could be cultured for 10 days in vitro.

Holocentridae) can accumulate and temporarily sequester copious amounts of zinc (Zn) in their livers. There, it is initially compartmentalized before a subsequent, estrogen-triggered redistribution to the ovaries. Here we show that cellular uptake of Zn is also influenced by estrogen signaling, and that estrogen increases concentrations of the plasma Zn-binding protein vitellogenin (VTG). However, estrogen-mediated increases in VTG are not sufficient to accommodate the magnitude of hepato-ovarian Zn transfer in female squirrelfish (Holocentrus adscensionis). These findings suggest that holocentrids have acquired the ability to use hormonal cues to drive hepatic uptake and storage of Zn, signal for its physiological redistribution, and influence the capacity for systemic transport of Zn beyond the mediation of increased plasma VTG concentrations. Such specific adaptations suggest an advantage for the oocyte, which is corroborated in further studies where we determined that oocyte Zn concentrations are positively correlated with egg viability in captivespawned squirrelfish. The novel nature of these findings underlies the importance of Zn in squirrelfish reproductive biology.

We aimed to identify new targets underlying this pleiotropic effect of lovastatin.Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the inhibitory effects of lovastatin on endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis in vitro. Lovastatin at high doses inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, we identified the up-regulation of the actin-binding protein transgelin 2 in endothelial cells following treatment with lovastatin. Changes in transgelin 2 levels were confirmed by Western blot and confocal microscopy. We further demonstrated that the Rho signaling inactivation and actin depolymerization contributed to the up-regulation of transgelin 2. The knockdown of transgelin 2 by siRNA dramatically enhanced endothelial migration and tube formation, and meanwhile attenuated the inhibitory effects of lovastatin on cell motility. Moreover, the lovastatin-induced inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation was also reversed by transgelin 2 knockdown. The activation of Rho GTPase in the absence of transgelin 2 may represent a mechanism underlying the regulation of phosphorylated myosin light chain by transgelin 2.Conclusions/Significance: These results strongly imply a novel role for transgelin 2 in the angiostatic activities of lovastatin.

Existing genomic analysis tools are often organized around literal views of genomes as linear strings. Even when information is highly condensed, these views grow cumbersome as larger numbers of genomes are added. Data aggregation and summarization methods from the field of visual analytics can provide abstracted comparative views, suitable for sifting large multi-genome datasets to identify critical similarities and differences. We introduce a software system for visual analysis of comparative genomics data. The system automates the process of data integration, and provides the analysis platform to identify and explore features of interest within these large datasets. GenoSets borrows techniques from business intelligence and visual analytics to provide a rich interface of interactive visualizations supported by a multi-dimensional data warehouse. In GenoSets, visual analytic approaches are used to enable querying based on orthology, functional assignment, and taxonomic or user-defined groupings of genomes. GenoSets links this information together with coordinated, interactive visualizations for both detailed and high-level categorical analysis of summarized data. GenoSets has been designed to simplify the exploration of multiple genome datasets and to facilitate reasoning about genomic comparisons. Case examples are included showing the use of this system in the analysis of 12 Brucella genomes. GenoSets software and the case study dataset are freely available at http://genosets.uncc.edu.

It is increasingly evident that different genes contribute to risk for similar syndromes and, conversely, the same genes or even the same alleles cross over traditional diagnostic categories. A current challenge is to understand the cellular biology of identified risk genes. However, most genes associated with complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes are not related through a known biochemical pathway, and many have an entirely unknown cellular function. One possibility is that diverse disease-linked genes converge at a higher-level cellular structure. The synapse is already known to be one such convergence, and emerging evidence suggests the primary cilium as another. Because many genes associated with neuropsychiatric illness are expressed also outside the nervous system, as are cilia, we tested the hypothesis that such genes affect conserved features of the primary cilium. Using RNA interference to test 41 broadly expressed candidate genes associated with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, we found 20 candidates that reduce ciliation in NIH3T3 cells when knocked down, and three whose manipulation increases cilia length. Three of the candidate genes were previously implicated in cilia formation and, altogether, approximately half of the candidates tested produced a ciliary phenotype. Our results support the hypothesis that primary cilia indeed represent a conserved cellular structure at which the effects of diverse neuropsychiatric risk genes converge. More broadly, they suggest a relatively simple cell-based approach that may be useful for exploring the complex biological underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disease.

It is known that the nuclear NF-kappa B oscillates and different oscillation patterns lead to different gene expression. Nearly forty reports on modeling and simulation of nuclear NF-kappa B have been published to date. The computational models reported so far are temporal or two-dimensional, and the discussions on spatial parameters have not been involved or limited. Since spatial parameters in cancer cells such as nuclear to cytoplasmic volume (N/C) ratio are different from normal cells, it is important to understand the relationship between oscillation patterns and spatial parameters. Here we report simulations of a 3D computational model for the oscillation of nuclear NF-kappa B using A-Cell software. First, we found that the default biochemical kinetic constants used in the temporal model cannot replicate the experimentally observed oscillation in the 3D model. Thus, the default parameters should be changed in the 3D model. Second, spatial parameters such as N/C ratio, nuclear transport, diffusion coefficients, and the location of I kappa B synthesis were found to alter the oscillation pattern. Third, among them, larger N/C ratios resulted in persistent oscillation of nuclear NF-kappa B, and larger nuclear transport resulted in faster oscillation frequency. Our simulation results suggest that the changes in spatial parameters seen in cancer cells is one possible mechanism for alteration in the oscillation pattern of nuclear NF-kappa B and lead to the altered gene expression in these cells.

For studies by high resolution analytical methods, these integral membrane receptors have to be expressed in large quantities, solubilized from cell membranes and purified in detergent micelles, which may result in a severe destabilization and a loss of function. Here, we report insights into differential effects of detergents, lipids and cannabinoid ligands on stability of the recombinant cannabinoid receptor CB2, and provide guidelines for preparation and handling of the fully functional receptor suitable for a wide array of downstream applications. While we previously described the expression in Escherichia coli, purification and liposome-reconstitution of multi-milligram quantities of CB2, here we report an efficient stabilization of the recombinant receptor in micelles - crucial for functional and structural characterization. The effects of detergents, lipids and specific ligands on structural stability of CB2 were assessed by studying activation of G proteins by the purified receptor reconstituted into liposomes. Functional structure of the ligand binding pocket of the receptor was confirmed by binding of H-2-labeled ligand measured by solid-state NMR. We demonstrate that a concerted action of an anionic cholesterol derivative, cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) and high affinity cannabinoid ligands CP-55,940 or SR-144,528 are required for efficient stabilization of the functional fold of CB2 in dodecyl maltoside (DDM)/CHAPS detergent solutions. Similar to CHS, the negatively charged phospholipids with the serine headgroup (PS) exerted significant stabilizing effects in micelles while uncharged phospholipids were not effective. The purified CB2 reconstituted into lipid bilayers retained functionality for up to several weeks enabling high resolution structural studies of this GPCR at physiologically relevant conditions.

The development and function of its auditory brainstem circuitry is exceptionally well studied. These circuits represent an excellent system for genetic manipulation to investigate mechanisms controlling neural circuit formation, synaptogenesis, neuronal polarity, and dendritic arborization. The present study investigates the auditory nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM). The neurotrophin receptor TrkB regulates dendritic structure in CNS neurons. TrkB is expressed in NM neurons at E7-E8 when these neurons have dendritic arbors. Downregulation of TrkB occurs after E8 followed by retraction of dendrites and by E18 most NM cells are adendritic. Is cessation of TrkB expression in NM necessary for dendritic retraction? To answer this question we combined focal in ovo electroporation with transposon mediated gene transfer to obtain stable expression of Doxycycline (Dox) regulated transgenes, specifically TrkB coexpressed with EGFP in a temporally controlled manner. Electroporation was performed at E2 and Dox added onto the chorioallointoic membrane from E7.5 to E16. Expression of EGFP had no effect on development of the embryo, or cell morphology and organization of auditory brainstem nuclei. NM cells expressing EGFP and TrkB at E17-E18 had dendrites and biophysical properties uncharacteristic for normal NM cells, indicating that cessation of TrkB expression is essential for dendrite retraction and functional maturation of these neurons. These studies indicate that expression of transposon based plasmids is an effective method to genetically manipulate events in mid to late embryonic brain development in chick.

Although ultrasensitive detection and analytical technology at the single molecule level is becoming routine, protein extraction techniques have not followed suit and still call for complete lysis that leads to cell death. In principle, with refined extraction techniques, intracellular proteins can potentially be extracted without killing the cell. In this Letter, we demonstrate that electroporation is capable of releasing intracellular proteins from adherent Chinese hamster ovary cells while preserving the cell viability. By tuning the duration and intensity of an electric pulse, we were able to control the average amount of protein release and the percentage of viable cells after the operation. Our results indicate that a substantial fraction of the cell population was able to release proteins under electroporation and survive the procedure. Interestingly, at the single cell level, the probability for cell death does not increase with more protein release. This work paves the way to extracting and analyzing intracellular proteins while keeping cells live.

Here, we apply an experimental approach to the subject. By using microbial-based microcosm-experiments, invasion-biology can be placed on firmer experimental, and hence, less anecdotal ground. A better understanding of the mechanisms that govern invasion-success of bacteria in soil communities will provide knowledge on the factors that hinder successful establishment of bacteria artificially inoculated into soil, e. g. for remediation purposes. Further, it will yield valuable information on general principles of invasion biology in other domains of life.Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we studied invasion and establishment success of GFP-tagged Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50090 in laboratory microcosms during a 42-day period. We used soil heating to create a disturbance gradient, and hypothesized that increased disturbance would facilitate invasion; our experiments confirmed this hypothesis. We suggest that the key factors associated with the heating disturbance that explain the enhanced invasion success are increased carbon substrate availability and reduced diversity, and thus, competition-and predation-release. In a second experiment we therefore separated the effects of increased carbon availability and decreased diversity. Here, we demonstrated that the effect of the indigenous soil community on bacterial invasion was stronger than that of resource availability. In particular, introduced bacteria established better in a long term perspective at lower diversity and predation pressure.Conclusion: We propose increased use of microbial systems, for experimental study of invasion scenarios. They offer a simple and cost-efficient way to study and understand biological invasion. Consequently such systems can help us to better predict the mechanisms controlling changes in stability of communities and ecosystems. This is becoming increasingly relevant since anthropogenic disturbance causes increasing global change, which promotes invasion. Moreover, a thorough understanding of factors controlling invasion and establishment of artificially amended microorganisms will mean a major step forward for soil-remediation microbiology.

This phenomenon, called ""length bias"", will influence subsequent analyses such as Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. In the presence of length bias, Gene Ontology categories that include longer genes are more likely to be identified as enriched. These categories, however, are not necessarily biologically more relevant. We show that one can effectively adjust for length bias in Gene Ontology analysis by including transcript length as a covariate in a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model makes the statistical issue underlying length bias more transparent: transcript length becomes a confounding factor when it correlates with both the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of the differential expression test. The inclusion of the transcript length as a covariate allows one to investigate the direct correlation between the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of testing differential expression, conditional on the transcript length. We present both real and simulated data examples to show that the logistic regression approach is simple, effective, and flexible.

Hydrophilic regions were prepared on hydrophobic PDMS plates by trapping and melting functional polymer particles and performing subsequent reactions with partially oxidized dextran. Small aliquots of a gelation solution were selectively trapped on the hydrophilic areas by a simple dipping process that was utilized to make thin hydrogel patterns by the in situ gelation of a sol solution. Using this process, we successfully formed calcium alginate, collagen I, and chitosan hydrogels with a thickness of several micrometers and shapes that followed the hydrophilized regions. In addition, alginate and collagen gel patterns were used to capture cells with different adhesion properties selectively on or off the hydrogel structures.

They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N-2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two ""end points"" represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related. Global change is affecting the magnitude of biogeochemical fluxes and ocean chemical inventories, leading to shifts in AMZ chemistry and biology that are likely to continue well into the future.

The effect of PDI inhibition on ovarian cancer progression is not yet clear, and there is a need for potent, selective, and safe small-molecule inhibitors of PDI. Here, we report a class of propynoic acid carbamoyl methyl amides (PACMAs) that are active against a panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines. Using fluorescent derivatives, 2D gel electrophoresis, and MS, we established that PACMA 31, one of the most active analogs, acts as an irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of PDI, forming a covalent bond with the active site cysteines of PDI. We also showed that PDI activity is essential for the survival and proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, PACMA 31 showed tumor targeting ability and significantly suppressed ovarian tumor growth without causing toxicity to normal tissues.

As in the philosophy of science in general, and in the philosophies of particular sciences, critical issues in the philosophy and sociology of astrobiology are both stimulated and illuminated by history. Among those issues are (1) epistemological issues such as the status of astrobiology as a science, the problematic nature of evidence and inference, and the limits of science; (2) metaphysical/scientific issues, including the question of defining the fundamental concepts of life, mind, intelligence, and culture in a universal context; the role of contingency and necessity in the origin of these fundamental phenomena; and whether or not the universe is in some sense fine-tuned for life and perhaps biocentric; (3) societal issues such as the theological, ethical, and worldview impacts of the discovery of microbial or intelligent life; and the question of whether the search for extraterrestrial life should be pursued at all, and with what precautions; and (4) issues related to the sociology of scientific knowledge, including the diverse attitudes and assumptions of different scientific communities and different cultures to the problem of life beyond Earth, the public ""will to believe,"" and the formation of the discipline of astrobiology.

Migratory birds may be especially vulnerable because of the wide range of geographic areas that they depend on throughout the annual cycle. We examined the potential effects of non-breeding season climate change on the breeding biology of Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii, formerly Dendroica kirtlandii), an endangered songbird that breeds in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and winters in the Bahamas. Our objectives were to determine whether spring arrival dates on the breeding grounds correlate with late winter rainfall in non-breeding areas and whether this has consequences for reproductive success. We used data on spring arrival dates and number of fledglings per year, sampling many individuals across multiple years, to show that males arrive on breeding grounds later following drier winters. There was a strong male age * rainfall interaction, which indicates that first-time breeders were much more sensitive to changes in rainfall than experienced adults. Regardless of age, however, drier winters and delayed arrival and nest initiation were significantly associated with fewer offspring fledged. These results are important because the Caribbean region is currently experiencing a significant drying trend, and climate change models predict that the severity of this drought will continue to increase. Any resulting adjustments to the timing of migration could constrain spring arrival dates and limit reproductive success for the endangered Kirtland's Warbler, as well as other Neotropical migrants wintering in the Caribbean.

This review intends to illustrate these perspectives through examples corresponding to different strategies of molecular-targeted therapies: use of a monoclonal antibody binding a receptor (rituximab and rheumatoid arthritis) or a ligand (bevacizumab and age-related macular degeneration), tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib and systemic sclerosis) or inhibitor of cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways (immunosuppressive and antiproliferative effects of mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors).

In 2004, World Health Organization classification united under this name all the carcinomas with sarcomatous or sarcomatous-like component with spindle cell or giant cell appearance. There are five subtypes: spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, pleomorphic carcinoma, carcino-sarcoma and pulmonary blastoma. Clinical characteristics are not specific from the others subtypes of NSCLC. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition pathway may play a key role. Patients are frequently symptomatic. Tumors are voluminous more often peripherical than central, with strong fixation on FDG TEP CT. Distant metastasis are frequent with atypical locations such as peritoneal or retroperitoneal sites. These tumors have poorer prognosis than the other NSCLC subtypes because of great aggressivity, and frequent chemoresistance. Here, we present a review of litterature in order to better describe these tumors.

In most families, it is caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene and is characterized by early onset of multiple specific cancers and very high lifetime cumulative cancer risk. Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular biology of TP53, the optimal clinical management of this syndrome is poorly defined. We convened a workshop on November 2, 2010, at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, bringing together clinicians and scientists, as well as individuals from families with LFS, to review the state of the science, address clinical management issues, stimulate collaborative research, and engage the LFS family community.

These companies can determine the local persistence of many species and have considerable implications for global conservation outcomes. Many companies are willing to invest in improved management as long as this does not undermine their businessindeed accessing green markets often makes commercial sense. Compliance with common standards of good commercial practice requires identification of all species of conservation significance which occur within their areas of management responsibility. But, as we demonstrate, it is impossible for companies to do this comprehensively. Such demands are often counterproductive in that they alienate those who might otherwise be willing to improve. Given the finite resources available for achieving conservation outcomes, we need to trade off data collection against other costs. To encourage adoption and implementation of conservation friendly practices requires incentives, not technical and financial obstacles. We challenge conservation biologists to reconsider the realities of good forest management, and provide pragmatic guidance for business compatible conservation. Until we engage more effectively with commercial interests, opportunities for improved conservation outcomes will be wasted.

We recently conducted an international survey to ascertain the attitudes, experiences, and expectations regarding biodiversity data sharing and archiving of researchers. The results show that whereas most respondents are willing to share article-related biodiversity data, more than 60% of respondents are unwilling to share primary data before publishing. Results indicate an underdeveloped culture of data sharing and several major technological and operational barriers. A major concern for researchers is appropriate benefits from data sharing. Most respondents would accept data archiving policies of journals. Researchers also express concerns about how to easily and efficiently deal with data and data quality in public databases. Expectations for biodiversity databases include standardization of data format, user-friendly data submission tools, formats for different types of data, and coordination among databases.

It is proving to be a huge challenge for computational biologists to use as much information as possible from experimental data to provide annotations for genome data of unknown function. A central component to this process is to use experimentally determined structures, which provide a means to detect homology that is not discernable from just the sequence and permit the consequences of genomic variation to be realized at the molecular level. In particular, structures also form the basis of many bioinformatics methods for improving the detailed functional annotations of enzymes in combination with similarities in sequence and chemistry.

Although many of these unconventional substrates can be coerced into performing classical computation, this is not how they ""naturally"" compute. Our ability to exploit unconventional computing is partly hampered by a lack of corresponding programming formalisms: we need models for building, composing, and reasoning about programs that execute in these substrates.

Metabolic alterations are initiated by oncogenes and are required for malignant transformation, allowing cancer cells to resist some cell death signals while producing energy and fulfilling their biosynthetic needs with limiting resources. The distinct metabolic phenotype of cancers provides an interesting avenue for treatment, potentially with minimal side effects. As many cancers show similar metabolic characteristics, drugs targeting the cancer metabolic phenotype are, perhaps optimistically, expected to be 'magic bullet' treatments. Over the last few years there have been a number of potential drugs developed to specifically target cancer metabolism. Several of these drugs are currently in clinical and preclinical trials.

Although mortality rates are typically <0.1% and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza strain has been well contained by vaccination and strict hygiene, particularly virulent pandemic forms have emerged three times in the last century, resulting in millions of deaths. Current vaccine and therapeutic strategies are limited by the ability of the virus to generate variants that evade vaccine-induced immune responses and resist the therapeutic effects of antiviral drugs. Host genetic variations affect immune responses and may induce adverse effects during drug treatment or against vaccines. To develop new, first-in-class therapeutics, new antiviral targets and new chemical entities must be identified in the context of the immunogenomic repertoire of the patient. Since influenza and so many other viruses need to escape innate immunity to become pathogenic, the viral proteins responsible for this, as well as the host cell molecular pathways that lead to the antiviral response, are an excellent potential source of new therapeutic targets within a systems approach against influenza infections.

In this study, we constructed an Ad5-Eag1-shRNA vector and evaluated its efficiency for Eag1 knockdown and its effects on osteosarcoma. Our results showed that Ad5-Eag1-shRNA had high interference efficiency of Eag1 expression and suppressed osteosarcoma growth both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying tumor growth inhibition induced by Eag1 silencing, the intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 staining and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by Western blot analysis. We found that Eag1 silencing led to decreased angiogenesis and VEGF expression in the xenograft model of osteosarcoma. Finally, we detected a time-dependent decrease in VEGF expression and considerably reduced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) activation in osteosarcoma cells treated by Eag1 shRNA.

However, due to the complexity of Chinese herbs, a full understanding of TCM's action mechanisms is still unavailable despite plenty of successful applications of TCM in the treatment of various diseases, including especially cardiovascular diseases (CVD), one of the leading causes of death. Thus in the present work, by incorporating the chemical predictors, target predictors and network construction approaches, an integrated system of TCM has been constructed to systematically uncover the underlying action mechanisms of TCM. From three representative Chinese herbs, i.e., Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen and Corydalis yanhusuo WT Wang which have been widely used in CVD treatment, by combinational use of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) screening and network pharmacology techniques, we have generated 64 bioactive ingredients and identified 54 protein targets closely associated with CVD, of which 29 are common targets (52.7%) of the three herbs. The result provides new information on the efficiency of the Chinese herbs for the treatment of CVD and also explains one of the basic theories of TCM, i.e., ""multiple herbal drugs can treat one disease"". The predicted potential targets were then mapped to target-disease and target-signal pathway connections, which revealed the relationships of the active ingredients with their potential targets, diseases and signal systems. This means that for the first time, the action mechanism of these three important Chinese herbs for the treatment of CVD is uncovered, by generating and identifying both their active ingredients and novel targets specifically related to CVD, which clarifies some of the common conceptions in TCM, and thus provides clues to modernize such specific herbal medicines.

One particular example of this concerns the etiologic agent Mycobacterium lepraemurium (MLM). MLM is a fastidious microorganism that is difficult to grow in axenic media; in a way, this has hampered attempts to thoroughly study its physiological and metabolic characteristics. MLM is an obligate intracellular bacillus that invades macrophages and replicates profusely with a generation time that oscillates between 0.5 and 11 days. In the present study, we have successfully maintained MLM alive for more than 12 days in vitro, providing us with an opportunity to study its susceptibility to several anti-leprosy agents and other drugs. To achieve this, we used a fluorescence reduction assay of alamar blue (a resazurin) in a microplate format (microplate-alamar-blue-assay; MABA), which is a highly sensitive, practical, and inexpensive method for assaying cell viability. We found that MLM was highly susceptible to clofazimine and rifampicin and was less susceptible to streptomycin, thiacetazone, kanamycin, dapsone, and ethionamide, in that order. MLM was not susceptible to four plant triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, neolignan-c, sitosterol, and ursolic acid) for which bactericidal activity has been reported in M. tuberculosis. Because the MABA has high sensitivity, it can be used to monitor the activity of microorganisms that are difficult to cultivate (such as M. lepraemurium), in response to various drugs, thus offering a method to complement the study of murine leprosy, about which many questions remain unanswered.

Rhizosphere soil layers from 01, 12, 23, 34, 46, and 68?mm distance to separated roots were investigated in an incubation experiment (42 d, 15 degrees C) for changes in total C and N and that derived from rhizodeposition in total soil, in soil microbial biomass, and in the 0.05 M K2SO4extractable soil fraction. CO2-C respiration in total and that derived from rhizodeposition were measured from the incubated rhizosphere soil samples. Rhizodeposition C was detected in rhizosphere soil up to 46?mm distance from the separated roots. Rhizodeposition N was only detected in the rhizosphere soils up to 34?mm distance from the roots. Microbial biomass C and N was increased with increasing proximity to the separated roots. Beside 13C and 15N derived from rhizodeposits, unlabeled soil C and N (native SOM) were incorporated into the growing microbial biomass towards the roots, indicating a distinct acceleration of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and N immobilization into the growing microbial biomass, even under the competition of plant growth. During the soil incubation, microbial biomass C and N decreased in all samples. Any decrease in microbial biomass C and N in the incubated rhizosphere soil layers is attributed mainly to a decrease of unlabeled (native) C and N, whereas the main portion of previously incorporated rhizodeposition C and N during the plant growth period remained immobilized in the microbial biomass during the incubation. Mineralization of native SOM C and N was enhanced within the entire investigated rhizosphere gradient. The results indicate complex interactions between substrate input derived from rhizodeposition, microbial growth, and accelerated C and N turnover, including the decomposition of native SOM (i.e., rhizosphere priming effects) at a high spatial resolution from the roots.

Methods: PDL stromal cells were obtained from extracted premolars by using the outgrowth method. Cell morphological features, self-replication capability, and the presence of cell-surface markers, along with osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation, were confirmed. In addition, myogenic differentiation was induced by the use of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) for DNA demethylation. Results: PDL stromal cells showed growth patterns and morphological features similar to those of fibroblasts. In contrast, the proliferation rates of premolar PDL stromal cells were similar to those of bone marrow and adipogenic stern cells. PDL stromal cells expressed surface markers of human mesenchymal stem cells (i.e., CD90 and CD105), but not those of hematopoietic stem cells (i.e., CD31 and CD34). PDL stromal cells were differentiated into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Myotube structures were induced in PDL stromal cells after 5-Aza pretreatment, but not in the absence of 5-Aza pretreatment. Conclusions: PDL stromal cells isolated from extracted premolars can potentially be a good source of postnatal stem cells for oromaxillofacial regeneration in bone and muscle.

Dramatic improvements in genomic research will require accurate sequencing of long (> 10,000 base-pairs), intact DNA molecules. Our approach directly visualizes the sequence of DNA molecules using electron microscopy. This report represents the first identification of DNA base pairs within intact DNA molecules by electron microscopy. By enzymatically incorporating modified bases, which contain atoms of increased atomic number, direct visualization and identification of individually labeled bases within a synthetic 3,272 base-pair DNA molecule and a 7,249 base-pair viral genome have been accomplished. This proof of principle is made possible by the use of a dUTP nucleotide, substituted with a single mercury atom attached to the nitrogenous base. One of these contrast-enhanced, heavy-atom-labeled bases is paired with each adenosine base in the template molecule and then built into a double-stranded DNA molecule by a template-directed DNA polymerase enzyme. This modification is small enough to allow very long molecules with labels at each A-U position.

Emerging applications of synthetic biology have begun to exploit such switches to achieve increasingly sophisticated designed behaviors. However, not all switch architectures allow facile design of the switching and memory properties. Furthermore, not all designs are built from components for which large families of variants exist, a requirement for building many orthogonal switch variants. Therefore, there is a critical need from genetic engineers for scalable strategies that yield custom bistable switches. Here, we use a sigma factor and its cognate anti-sigma factor to experimentally verify that ultrasensitivity from sequestration combined with positive feedback is sufficient to build a bistable switch. We show that sequestration allows us to predictably tune the switching boundaries, and we can easily tune our switch to function as a set-reset latch that can be toggled between two states by a pulse of inducer input.

Previous evidence suggested substantial divergence of regulatory networks across species. However, systematically assessing the extent of this plasticity and its functional implications has been challenging due to limited experimental data and the noisy nature of computational predictions. Here, we introduce a novel approach to study cis-regulatory evolution, and use it to trace the regulatory history of 88 DNA motifs of transcription factors across 23 Ascomycota fungi. While motifs are conserved, we find a pervasive gain and loss in the regulation of their target genes. Despite this turnover, the biological processes associated with a motif are generally conserved. We explain these trends using a model with a strong selection to conserve the overall function of a transcription factor, and a much weaker selection over the specific genes it targets. The model also accounts for the turnover of bound targets measured experimentally across species in yeasts and mammals. Thus, selective pressures on regulatory networks mostly tolerate local rewiring, and may allow for subtle fine-tuning of gene regulation during evolution.

The detailed knowledge of the signaling pathways determining vulval precursor cell (VPC) fates permitted us to create a computational model based on the antagonistic interactions between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/RAS/MAPK and the NOTCH pathways that specify the primary and secondary fates, respectively. A key notion of our model is called bounded asynchrony, which predicts that a limited degree of asynchrony in the progression of the VPCs is necessary to break their equivalence. While searching for a molecular mechanism underlying bounded asynchrony, we discovered that the termination of NOTCH signaling is tightly linked to cell-cycle progression. When single VPCs were arrested in the G1 phase, intracellular NOTCH failed to be degraded, resulting in a mixed primary/secondary cell fate. Moreover, the G1 cyclins CYD-1 and CYE-1 stabilize NOTCH, while the G2 cyclin CYB-3 promotes NOTCH degradation. Our findings reveal a synchronization mechanism that coordinates NOTCH signaling with cell-cycle progression and thus permits the formation of a stable cell fate pattern.

It represents a unique strategy of antibiotic tolerance and it can complicate design of effective antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we have analyzed responses of a lab strain of Escherichia coli to antibiotics that target the ribosome. We show that the IE can be explained by bistable inhibition of bacterial growth. A critical requirement for this bistability is sufficiently fast degradation of ribosomes, which can result from antibiotic-induced heat-shock response. Furthermore, antibiotics that elicit the IE can lead to 'band-pass' response of bacterial growth to periodic antibiotic treatment: the treatment efficacy drastically diminishes at intermediate frequencies of treatment. Our proposed mechanism for the IE may be generally applicable to other bacterial species treated with antibiotics targeting the ribosomes.

Analog-sensitive alleles of protein kinases are powerful chemical genetic tools for rapid and specific interrogation of kinase function. Moreover, combining these tools with advanced proteomics and substrate labeling has identified phosphorylation sites on numerous protein targets.

In the past years, near-field nanoscopy - using near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) - has enabled key breakthroughs in this fast moving area. These two highly-sensitive surface scanning probe techniques go far beyond nano-imaging, by enabling researchers to localize and manipulate individual molecules on cell surfaces with nanoscale spatial resolution. Specifically, nanophotonic approaches and dynamic measurements in ultra-confined volumes allow nowadays the visualization of dynamic processes on cell membranes with optical spatial resolution down to 30 nm and sub-millisecond time resolution. These NSOM approaches are now exploited to reveal the existence of pre-assembled nanoplatforms of multi-molecular components on mammalian cells, to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the well-defined architecture of the cell surface and to decipher the molecular bases of diverse cellular processes, ranging from cell adhesion to pathogen recognition. In parallel, remarkable progress in AFM techniques now provides new opportunities for localizing single molecules in living cells and for analyzing their adhesive and mechanical properties in relation to function.

However, it is a non-trivial task to understand how a change at the protein structure level eventually affects a cell's behavior. This is because complex information at both the protein and pathway level has to be integrated. Given that the idea of integrating both protein and pathway dynamics to estimate the systemic impact of missense mutations in proteins remains predominantly unexplored, we investigate the practicality of such an approach by formulating mathematical models and comparing them with experimental data to study missense mutations. We present two case studies: (1) interpreting systemic perturbation for mutations within the cell cycle control mechanisms (G2 to mitosis transition) for yeast; (2) phenotypic classification of neuron-related human diseases associated with mutations within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that the application of simplified mathematical models is feasible for understanding the effects of small sequence changes on cellular behavior.

To understand how this occurs, there is a need for developing computational schemes that contribute to integration of genomic-scale information and assist investigators in formulating biological hypotheses in a quantitative and systematic fashion. In this work, we combined metabolome data and constraint-based modeling to elucidate the relationships among structural modules, functional organization, and the optimal metabolic phenotype of Rhizobium etli, a bacterium that fixes nitrogen in symbiosis with Phaseolus vulgaris. To experimentally characterize the metabolic phenotype of this microorganism, we obtained the metabolic profile of 220 metabolites at two physiological stages: under free-living conditions, and during nitrogen fixation with P. vulgaris. By integrating these data into a constraint-based model, we built a refined computational platform with the capability to survey the metabolic activity underlying nitrogen fixation in R. etli. Topological analysis of the metabolic reconstruction led us to identify modular structures with functional activities. Consistent with modular activity in metabolism, we found that most of the metabolites experimentally detected in each module simultaneously increased their relative abundances during nitrogen fixation. In this work, we explore the relationships among topology, biological function, and optimal activity in the metabolism of R. etli through an integrative analysis based on modeling and metabolome data.

More fundamentally, we supply evidence that such modular organization during functional nitrogen fixation is a robust property under different environmental conditions.

These methods have been used to study 40 publicly available HapMap samples of European (CEU) and African (YRI) ancestry to demonstrate a sequencing error rate, <5.63X10(-4), nucleotide diversity of 1.6x10(-3) for CEU and 3.7x10(-3) for YRI, patterns of sequence variation consistent with earlier studies, but a higher rate of heteroplasmy varying between 10% and 50%. These results demonstrate that next-generation sequencing technologies allow interrogation of the mitochondrial genome in greater depth than previously possible which may be of value in biology and medicine.

A strong relevance of this metabolic individuality for biomedical and pharmaceutical research has been reported. However, a considerable amount of the molecules currently quantified by modern metabolomics techniques are chemically unidentified. The identification of these ""unknown metabolites"" is still a demanding and intricate task, limiting their usability as functional markers of metabolic processes. As a consequence, previous GWAS largely ignored unknown metabolites as metabolic traits for the analysis. Here we present a systems-level approach that combines genome-wide association analysis and Gaussian graphical modeling with metabolomics to predict the identity of the unknown metabolites. We apply our method to original data of 517 metabolic traits, of which 225 are unknowns, and genotyping information on 655,658 genetic variants, measured in 1,768 human blood samples. We report previously undescribed genotype-metabotype associations for six distinct gene loci (SLC22A2, COMT, CYP3A5, CYP2C18, GBA3, UGT3A1) and one locus not related to any known gene (rs12413935). Overlaying the inferred genetic associations, metabolic networks, and knowledge-based pathway information, we derive testable hypotheses on the biochemical identities of 106 unknown metabolites. As a proof of principle, we experimentally confirm nine concrete predictions. We demonstrate the benefit of our method for the functional interpretation of previous metabolomics biomarker studies on liver detoxification, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Our approach is generic in nature and can be directly transferred to metabolomics data from different experimental platforms.

In this study we have used a combination of live imaging, single cell lineage analyses, and perturbation of specific signaling pathways to dissect the specification of the adaxial cells of the zebrafish embryo. We show that the adaxial cells are myogenic precursors that form a cell fate equivalence group of approximately 20 cells that consequently give rise to two distinct sub-types of muscle fibers: the superficial slow muscle fibers (SSFs) and muscle pioneer cells (MPs), distinguished by specific gene expression and cell behaviors. Using a combination of live imaging, retrospective and indicative fate mapping, and genetic studies, we show that MP and SSF precursors segregate at the beginning of segmentation and that they arise from distinct regions along the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes of the adaxial cell compartment. FGF signaling restricts MP cell fate in the anterior-most adaxial cells in each somite, while BMP signaling restricts this fate to the middle of the DV axis. Thus our results reveal that the synergistic actions of HH, FGF, and BMP signaling independently create a three-dimensional (3D) signaling milieu that coordinates cell fate within the adaxial cell equivalence group.

Due to their great public health importance it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanism(s) of cold adaptation and temperature sensitivity that are currently unknown. For instance, secondary RNA structures play important roles in influenza biology. Thus, we hypothesized that a relatively minor change in temperature (32-39 degrees C) can lead to perturbations in influenza RNA structures and, that these structural perturbations may be different for mRNAs of the wild type (wt) and ca/ts strains. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel in silico method that enables assessing whether two related RNA molecules would undergo (dis)similar structural perturbations upon temperature change. The proposed method allows identifying those areas within an RNA chain where dissimilarities of RNA secondary structures at two different temperatures are particularly pronounced, without knowing particular RNA shapes at either temperature. We identified such areas in the NS2, PA, PB2 and NP mRNAs. However, these areas are not identical for the wt and ca/ts mutants. Differences in temperature-induced structural changes of wt and ca/ts mRNA structures may constitute a yet unappreciated molecular mechanism of the cold adaptation/temperature sensitivity phenomena.

The specificity of both methods has been verified by 16S rDNA and oprF sequencing. The application of selective plating and gacA/oprF PCR-RFLP analyses revealed differences in the amount and predominant type of culturable pseudomonads among geographical locations, among treatments, and between rhizospheric and bulk soil.

The intention of this review is to present the experience accumulated in the field of the reproductive health of these women.In several rare respiratory diseases, a genetic base has been identified. The combination of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, assisted reproduction and molecular biology techniques enable embryos to be studied genetically before being transplanted into the uterus. Therefore, the risk for transmitting a certain disease or chromosome alteration may be avoided in high-risk couples, and prenatal diagnoses may be done by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.As a general rule, contraceptive methods should be personalized by evaluating the general state of female patients as well as their possibilities for pregnancy, complications and the future possibility of lung transplantation.In lymphangioleiomyomatosis and primary pulmonary hypertension, pregnancy is considered a contraindication. In the former, there is a very high risk for pneumothorax and loss of lung function. In the latter, mortality reaches 33%.

Recent discoveries, including the activity of retrotransposons, the extent of copy number variations, somatic and chromosomal mosaicism, and the nature of the epigenome as a regulator of DNA expressivity, are challenging a series of dogmas concerning the nature of the genome and the relationship between genotype and phenotype. According to three widely held dogmas, DNA is the unchanging template of heredity, is identical in all the cells and tissues of the body, and is the sole agent of inheritance. Rather than being an unchanging template, DNA appears subject to a good deal of environmentally induced change. Instead of identical DNA in all the cells of the body, somatic mosaicism appears to be the normal human condition. And DNA can no longer be considered the sole agent of inheritance. We now know that the epigenome, which regulates gene expressivity, can be inherited via the germline. These developments are particularly significant for behavior genetics for at least three reasons: First, epigenetic regulation, DNA variability, and somatic mosaicism appear to be particularly prevalent in the human brain and probably are involved in much of human behavior; second, they have important implications for the validity of heritability and gene association studies, the methodologies that largely define the discipline of behavior genetics; and third, they appear to play a critical role in development during the perinatal period and, in particular, in enabling phenotypic plasticity in offspring. I examine one of the central claims to emerge from the use of heritability studies in the behavioral sciences, the principle of minimal shared maternal effects, in light of the growing awareness that the maternal perinatal environment is a critical venue for the exercise of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. This consideration has important implications for both developmental and evolutionary biology.

Postlarval and juvenile gag were collected from late spring to early fall of 2007 and 2008 using a variety of gear types; otoliths from postlarvae collected in previous years were also examined.

The distributions of PLDs were similar among sampling months suggesting no effect of PLD on subsequent survival. Although there was no relationship between PLD and date of ingress, PLD was shorter for fish with later fertilization dates. Juvenile growth rates derived from length and estimated ages were approximately 1.4 mm d(-1) during summer months and did not differ between years.

So, it could be predicted that some genes expressed in a specific sarcoma might have prognostic significance or therapeutic targeting potential and molecular targets can be identified in the tumor or in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore the initial evaluation of a sarcoma patient should include in-depth genetic evaluation including karyotyping and c-DNA/protein expression profiling. The chemokine signaling demonstrated to be deeply implicated in sarcoma development as well as to have a significant role in development of metastatic disease, especially in directing tumor cells towards the preferential sites of metastases in sarcoma, lung and bone. It is unsolved if the blood stream is a more favorable environment compared to lymphatic or if lymph nodes are more efficient in destroying metastatic sarcoma cells. But the comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms of the behavior of mesenchymal malignant tumors is at its dawn.

Spectrum theory is most consistent with the progression of melanoma from the primary site to the in-transit locations, regional or sentinel lymph nodes and beyond to the distant sites. Therefore, early diagnosis and surgical treatment before its spread is the most effective treatment. Recently, new approaches have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma. Genomic profiling and sequencing will form the basis for molecular taxonomy for more accurate subgrouping of melanoma patients in the future. New insights of molecular mechanisms of metastasis are summarized in this review article. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become a standard of care for staging primary melanoma without the need for a more morbid complete regional lymph node dissection. With recent developments in molecular biology and genomics, novel molecular targeted therapy is being developed through clinical trials. ", Oncology 10.1007/s10585-012-9517-x,Meeting the biologic challenge of colorectal metastases,"Abstract: An overview of colorectal cancer discussed (Philip Paty) the good outcome after primary management with local control in 90-95 % of colon and 85 % in rectal cancer patients with major progression to metastases and to death related to hematogenous dissemination. The major disease pathways include the APC, aneuploid pathway involving mutations of P53, KRAS, SMAD 4, or the CMP/MSI pathway, mismatched repair defect as characterized by Lynch syndrome, the major hereditary form which may also have KRAS and P53 mutations. The common sporadic colorectal cancers are MS1 high, with many patients having BRAF and KRAS mutations. The sentinel node biopsy in colorectal cancer surgery may provide more definitive staging and perhaps modification of the extent of resection with better outcome as suggested by Dr. Saha. The identification of sentinel lymph nodes outside of the planned bowel resection may increase the resection biologically indicated by the sentinel lymph node location leading to better outcome. In a small study by Dr. Saha, the operation was enhanced in 21 % by extending the length of bowel resection, which increased node recovery to 18.5 nodes versus 12 nodes with the more conventional resection, increasing nodal recovery, and positivity to 60 % with reduction to five year recurrence rate to 9 % versus 27 % with the conventional resection. A new (Swiss) technique for pathologic node examination, the OSNA (the One Step Nucleic Acid diagnostic system), was presented which demonstrated increased detection of micro-metastases in a focused pathology study of 22 patients (Zuber) to 11 out of 15 patients versus the 7 micro-metastases identified by the standard single slide per node, and compared to 14 out of 15 with an intensive multi-slide technique. This suggests value in pursuing OSNA study by other centers with relevant clinical trials to establish its true value. An analysis of liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) emphasized the value of 10-year follow-up (DeAngelica). The 10-year survival of 102 patients among 612 patients was 17 % (Memorial Sloan Kettering data). At the five-year point 99 of 102 survivors were NED and 86 have been free of disease since the resection. The usual five-year figure after hepatic resection reveals that one-third of five-year survivors die from recurrence of distant disease suggesting the value of longer term follow-up in these patients. An additional question reviewed related to the role of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (with response rates in the 50 % range) to produce down staging of the hepatic metastases and allow one to retrieve these patients with possible residual disease. In a series of 116 patients who had hepatic resection of CRC metastases in presence of regional node metastases, post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (normally not candidates for resection) these patients were demonstrated to have a 95 % recurrence at median time of 9 months. This raises a cautionary note to the literature report of five-year survivals in the 20-30 % range for hepatic metastases in presence of extra hepatic disease. Such may reflect patient selection rather than a true measure of the biology of disease, and warrant clinical trial evaluation. Lastly, regional therapy and overall systemic therapy were addressed by Dr. Kemeny. The CALGB study of hepatic artery infusion (HAI) with FUDR, dexamethasone versus 5FU leucovorin showed an overall survival of 24.4 months with HAI versus 20 months with systemic therapy (P = 0.0034).An adjuvant trial of HAI at MSK in 156 patients showed an overall survival benefit at 2 year and recent long term 10yr follow-up showing a significant overall survival of 41 % with HAI versus 27 % with systemic therapy (5FU leucovorin). In the neoadjuvant Nordlinger trial for hepatic metastases, there was a significant outcome differences-the preoperative therapy group had 9.2 % increase of progression free survival versus the surgery alone group which suggests the value of combining neoadjuvant surgery in good risk liver resection candidates. Conclude the final lesson from this well presented mini symposium confirms the need for continued evaluation of the numerous discussion points by clinical trial.

Although good functional assays exist to measure these tumor parameters, and their use has led to the understanding of factors affecting outcome after radiotherapy, their application in clinical practice is hampered by technical difficulties, the length of time needed to obtain results and the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials. Recently, with the progress in molecular biology, genome-wide screening methods have been used to look for genetic signatures that can distinguish between good and bad outcome after radiotherapy. One of the most promising candidates is the epidermal growth factor receptor which is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of malignancies, such lung and head and neck cancer. Inhibition of this receptor has led to radio-sensitization with the prolongation of median survival in several cancers. Since there is significant variability in the response of patients with the same disease to radiotherapy, it would be very valuable to be able to predict which patients would benefit from a molecularly targeted therapy administered with concomitant radiation in order to increase the response rate (and cure rate) of those patients with radioresistant tumors. Optimally, this assay should be able to provide results in an efficient and reproducible manner and detect tumor genetic mutations that would provide specificity to the intervention. One approach currently in clinical practice to overcome intrinsic radioresistance and repopulation is stereotactic body radiotherapy coupled with image-guided radiation, a highly precise and powerful form of radiation, allowing radiation oncologist to treat tumors with more aggressive biological doses of radiation without causing serious normal tissues injury.

Oxysterols play critical roles in normal physiologic functions as well as in pathophysiologic processes in a variety of organ systems. This review provides an overview of oxysterol biology from the vantage point of the biliary system. Several oxysterols have been identified in human bile in the context of biliary tract infection and inflammation. This finding has led to investigations regarding the potential pathophysiologic significance of biliary oxysterols in diseases affecting the biliary system, with an emphasis on cholangiocarcinoma. Emerging evidence implicates specific oxysterols in the development and progression of this malignancy.

We investigated the relationships among the levels of these cytokines by assessing clinical findings, liver histology and viremia. Sixty untreated patients and 28 healthy individuals were included in the study. Cytokine levels were determined using ELISA. Differences between HCV and control groups were identified in the median levels of IL-17F (controls = 172.4 pg/mL; HCV = 96.8 pg/mL, p <0.001) and IL-8 (controls = 30.1 pg/mL; HCV = 18.1 pg/mL, p <0.05). IL-6 levels were higher in patients presenting moderate liver necroinflammation than in patients with mild or no liver necroinflammation (p <0.05). IL-17F levels were increased in patients that had increased ALT levels. Additionally, a strong positive correlation was observed between IL-17F and IL-22 levels in the two groups investigated, and the IL-17F/IL-22 ratio was lower in the patients infected with HCV (p < 0.0001). Patients with low HCV viral loads had higher median levels of IL-8 (32.5 pg/mL) than did patients with high HCV loads (16.7 pg/mL, p <0.05). These results suggest that in chronic hepatitis C infection, IL-17F and IL-8 could be associated with the control of liver injury and infection, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The bioreactors might be intended for generation of cell inoculum and production, research, process development, validation, or transfer purposes. During these activities, not only the difficulty of up and downscaling might lead to failure of consistency in cell growth, but also the use of different bioreactor geometries and operation conditions. In such cases, criteria for bioreactor design and process transfer should be carefully evaluated in order to select appropriate cultivation parameters. In this work, power input, mixing time, impeller tip speed, and Reynolds number have been compared systematically for the cultivation of the human cell line AGE1.HN within three partner laboratories using five different bioreactor systems. Proper operation ranges for the bioreactors were identified using the maximal cell-specific growth rate (mu(max)) as indicator. Common optimum values for process transfer criteria were found in these geometrically different bioreactors, in which deviations of mu(max) between cultivation systems can be importantly reduced. The data obtained in this work are used for process standardization and comparability of results obtained in different bioreactor systems, i.e. to guarantee lab-to-lab consistency for systems biology approaches using mammalian cells.

A variety of dissimilatory sulfur metabolisms, i.e. reactions used for energy conservation, are found in archaea from both the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla. Although not yet fully characterized, major processes include aerobic elemental sulfur (S0) oxidation, anaerobic S0 reduction, anaerobic sulfate/sulfite reduction and anaerobic respiration of organic sulfur. Assimilatory sulfur metabolism, i.e. reactions used for biosynthesis of sulfur-containing compounds, also possesses some novel features. Cysteine biosynthesis in some archaea uses a unique tRNA-dependent pathway. Fe-S cluster biogenesis in many archaea differs from that in bacteria and eukaryotes and requires unidentified components. The eukaryotic ubiquitin system is conserved in archaea and involved in both protein degradation and biosynthesis of sulfur-containing cofactors.

In this study, an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and a selection of saccharide were applied to A. castellanii by chemical mutagenesis. To understand the functional roles of a mannose-binding protein (MBP). A. castellanii were treated with methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside abbreviated Man, with and without the EMS pre-treatment, and their adhesion and cytotoxicity were analyzed, using a human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) as the target cell. Both EMS and Man mutants exhibited significantly decreased levels of MBP expression and cytotoxicity to HBMEC, but showed similar levels of binding to HBMEC, as compared with the wild type. Of interest was that the exogenous mannose inhibited amoebae (i.e.. Man mutant) binding to the HBMEC by <20%. Only the mutant Man exhibited a significant decrease in bacterial uptake, as compared to the wild type, 0.020 vs 0.032 (p < 0.05) and proteolytic activity. The results showed that MBP should be clearly provided as the pathogenic target candidate, to further target-based therapy, but EMS mutation should not be associated with initial adhesion and phagocytosis of A. castellanii.

The authors report in this article a new zebrafish transgenic line Tg(-4725sox10:Cre)ba74. This line expresses Cre under the control of a well-characterized portion of the sox10 promoter and, by crossing to a floxed-reporter line, the authors show in this article that expression in this line is consistent with those described for GFP reporter lines using the same promoter. Reporter expression is readily detected in patterns consistent with the early expression domains. Thus, the authors see all major groups (pigment, neural, and skeletal) of NC-derived cell-types, as well as cell-types derived from the known non-NC sites of sox10 expression, including otic epithelium and oligodendrocytes.

There is evidence that this noise can cause reactions on the behavior of the fish resulting in reduced catches. To mitigate the problem and the conflict of interest between the fishing industry and the seismic exploration interest, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) commissioned SINTEF Information and Communication Technology (ICT, Trondheim, Norway) and the Department of Biology, University of Oslo (Oslo, Norway) to develop an acoustic-biological model to predict the impact of seismic noise on the fish population. The ultimate goal is to develop an acoustic-biological model to use in the design and planning of seismic surveys such that the disturbance to fishing interest is minimized. This acoustic module of the model is based on ray theory and can deal with range-dependent bathymetry and depth-dependent sound-speed profiles. The bottom is modeled as a sedimentary fluid layer over a solid elastic rock and the model requires the thickness and seismoacoustic properties of the sediments layer and the rock with compressional speed, shear speed, and absorption. The model simulates the total sound field, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain, out to very large distances. Calculated sound exposure levels are compared with startle response levels for cod. Preliminary conclusions indicate a required distance in the range of 5-10 km, but dependent on the depth and the season. In additions, under certain conditions, there will appear regions with hot spots where the sound level is significantly higher due to caustics and focusing of sound. Modeled results are compared with results obtained from a joint seismoacoustic survey conducted in summer 2009 at Vesteralen-Lofoten area (Nordland VII). In this experiment, signals were recorded at fixed hydrophone positions as the seismic vessel approached from a maximum distance of 30 km toward the receiving positions. The same situation was modeled using available geological and oceanographic information as input to the acoustic model. The agreement between the real and recorded signals and the model results is good. This indicates that in the future acoustic-biological models may be used in the design and planning of seismic surveys such that the disturbance to fishing is minimized.

Today, the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) provides increasingly higher energy beams, up to 150 keV combined with higher brilliance (10(13) X-ray photons/sec). This means that detectors suffer from low X-ray absorption at high spatial resolution (1-10 mu m) and from radiation damage in tomography and diffraction applications. In addition, more and more experiments in medicine require the absorbed dose by the sample to be reduced. In this context, more efficient scintillators are developed and evaluated at the ESRF. In order to perform sub-micrometer and micrometer resolution imaging scintillators 1 mu m to 500 mu m thin are required. Single Crystal Film scintillators (SCF), 1 mu m to 100 mu m can be obtained via Liquid Phase Epitaxy for sub-micrometer resolution. Transparent ceramics, 100 mu m to 500 mu m thick are promising candidates for X-ray imaging requiring high X-ray absorption and good contrast with micrometer resolution. Commonly available scintillators, such as CdWO4 and YAG:Ce suffer from low efficiency, therefore new scintillators with higher light yield and stopping-power are required. A first test was carried out to evaluate an Europium doped Lutetium Oxide ceramic for micrometer resolution and new SCFs of Lu3Ga5-xInxO12 : Eu for sub-micrometer resolution are investigated. Performance of Lu2O3 and LuInGG, i.e absorption, light yield, afterglow, spatial resolution will be presented and compared to standard screens (YAG, GGG).

Although several methods have been developed recently to reconstruct biological networks, there are few systematic and comprehensive studies that compare different methods in terms of their ability to handle incomplete datasets, high data dimensions and noisy data. The authors use experimentally measured and synthetic datasets to compare three popular methods - principal component regression (PCR), linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) - in terms of root-mean-squared error (RMSE), average fractional error in the value of the coefficients, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity. This comparison enables the authors to establish criteria for selection of an appropriate approach for network reconstruction based on a priori properties of experimental data. For instance, although PCR is the fastest method, LASSO and LMI perform better in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Both PCR and LASSO are better than LMI in terms of fractional error in the values of the computed coefficients. Trade-offs such as these suggest that more than one aspect of each method needs to be taken into account when designing strategies for network reconstruction.

Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis. Currently, surgical tumor debulking followed by chemotherapy based on platinum and taxane is the standard treatment for advanced disease. However, these patients remain at great risk for recurrence and developing drug resistance. Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed to improve outcomes for patients with advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. Several agents targeted at particular molecules have been developed for ovarian cancer and are now entering clinical trials. The functional targets of these agents are aberrations in tumor tissues including angiogenesis, the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and alpha-folate receptor (alpha-FR). The anti-angiogenic compound bevacizumab has been reported as the most effective targeted agent. Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) both for advanced and platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, but did not increase overall survival. A PARP inhibitor, olaparib, applied as maintenance treatment also improved PFS in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. Furthermore, mTOR inhibitors and a monoclonal antibody to alpha-FR, farletuzumab, are attractive treatment strategies either alone or combined with chemotherapy. Understanding the tumor molecular biology and identifying predictive biomarkers are essential steps in selecting the best treatment strategies.

Patients' personal beliefs about depression and antidepressants are regarded as central influences on adherence.Objectives: The aim was to gain detailed insight into patients' personal accounts of depression and use of antidepressant medication and to relate these accounts to the patients' self-reported level of adherence.Methods: In-depth, qualitative interviews of 16 depressed patients one, four, eight and twelve months after hospital discharge supplemented by diagnostic interviews and self-report measures. Kleinman's notion of ""explanatory model"" was used as the theoretical perspective on the patients' illness narratives. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically with ""explanatory models"" as the starting point.Results: Patients had ambiguous experiences of depression and antidepressants. Patients explained their illness and the medical treatment in experience-near terms. Explanations of the reasons for depression were psychosocial and biology and medicine were not central. However, taking antidepressant medication was a meaningful part of being admitted to hospital, and the adoption of the rhetoric and practices of biomedicine strengthened patients' sense of control and hope for recovery. If medicine was ineffective, the explanatory models legitimised alternative strategies towards recovery, including non-adherence.Conclusions: The patients' reasons for adhering to antidepressants included a range of diverse psychosocial issues, and could be regarded as a central part of their common sense illness management.

Here we identified and quantified 4623 Kac sites in 1800 Kac proteins in SIRT1(+/+) and SIRT1(-/-) MEF cells, representing the first study to reveal an enzyme-regulated Kac subproteome and the largest Lys acetylome reported to date from a single study. Four hundred eighty-five Kac sites were enhanced by more than 100% after SIRT1 knockout. Our results indicate that SIRT1 regulates the Kac states of diverse cellular pathways. Interestingly, we found that a number of acetyltransferases and major acetyltransferase complexes are targeted by SIRT1. Moreover, we showed that the activities of the acetyltransferases are regulated by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation. Taken together, our results reveal the Lys acetylome in response to SIRT1, provide new insights into mechanisms of SIRT1 function, and offer biomarker candidates for the clinical evaluation of SIRT1-activator compounds.

In general, nanoscience-based approaches have circumvented limitations in the delivery of cancer therapeutics, related to their poor aqueous solubility and toxicity issues with conventional vehicles and resulted in improved pharmacokinetics and biodisiribution. Included in the discussion are promising examples and pharmaceutical perspectives on liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, carbon nanotubes and magnetic nanoparticles.

We engineered sender, processor and receiver cells that interact with each other in ways that resemble natural intercellular communication networks such as multistep information processing cascades, feed-forward-based signaling loops, and two-way communication.

The present study aims to establish an in vitro system for developmental neurotoxicity testing employing mESCs. We developed a robust and reproducible protocol for fast and efficient differentiation of the mESC line D3 into neural cells, optimized with regard to chemical testing.Morphological examination and immunocytochemical staining confirmed the presence of different neural cell types, including neural progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and radial glial cells. Neurons derived from D3 cells expressed the synaptic proteins PSD95 and synaptophysin, and the neurotransmitters serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Calcium ion imaging revealed the presence of functionally active glutamate and dopamine receptors. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of the neuron-specific marker protein MAP2 on day 12 after induction of differentiation demonstrated a concentration dependent effect of the neurodevelopmental toxicants methylmercury chloride, chlorpyrifos, and lead acetate on neuronal differentiation.The current study shows that D3 mESCs differentiate efficiently into neural cells involving a neurosphere-like state and that this system is suitable to detect adverse effects of neurodevelopmental toxicants. Therefore, we propose that the protocol for differentiation of mESCs into neural cells described here could constitute one component of an in vitro testing strategy for developmental neurotoxicity.

The ability to integrate a specifically engineered piece of DNA into the genome of a living system is fundamental to our efforts to understand life and exploit its implications for medicine, nanotechnology and bioprospecting. However, transgenesis has been hampered by position effects and multi-copy integration problems, which are mainly due to the use of small, plasmid-based transgenes. Large transgenes based on native genomic regions cloned into bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) circumvent these problems but are prone to fragmentation. Herein, we report that contrary to widely held notions, large BAC-sized constructs do not prohibit transposition. We also report the first reliable method for BAC transgenesis in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The PiggyBac or Sleeping Beauty transposon inverted repeats were integrated into BAC vectors by recombineering, followed by co-lipofection with the corresponding transposase in hESCs to generate robust fluorescent protein reporter lines for OCT4, NANOG, GATA4 and PAX6. BAC transposition delivers several advantages, including increased frequencies of single-copy, full-length integration, which will be useful in all transgenic systems but especially in difficult venues like hESCs.

The best-developed answer, Craver's causal-mechanical account, has several weaknesses. It does not fully explicate the target of explanation, interlevel relation, or interactive nonmodular character of many biological mechanisms as we understand them. An alternative account of MEx, emphasizing interdependence among a mechanism's components ('jointness'), remedies these difficulties.

This ability is typically studied in the lab by asking observers to indicate their estimate of the time between two external sensory events. The results of such studies confirm that humans can accurately estimate durations on a variety of time scales. Although many brain areas are thought to contribute to the representation of elapsed time, recent neurophysiological studies have linked the parietal cortex in particular to the perception of sub-second time intervals. In this Primer, we describe previous work on parietal cortex and time perception, and we highlight the findings of a study published in this issue of PLOS Biology, in which Schneider and Ghose [1] characterize single-neuron responses during performance of a novel ""Temporal Production"" task. During temporal production, the observer must track the passage of time without anticipating any external sensory event, and it appears that the parietal cortex may use a unique strategy to support this type of measurement.

Some internal structures are distributed asymmetrically to the right or left side. A conserved Nodal and BMP signaling system directs molecular pathways that impart the sidedness to those asymmetric structures. In the sea urchin embryo, one such asymmetrical structure, oddly enough, is the entire adult, which grows out of left sided structures produced in the larva. In a paper just published in PLOS Biology, BMP signaling is shown to be necessary early in larval development to initiate the asymmetric specification of one of those left-sided structures, called the left coelomic pouch. This study reports that BMP signaling activates a group of transcription factors asymmetrically in the left coelomic pouch only, which launch the pathway that eventually leads to the formation of the adult that emerges from the larva at metamorphosis.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was first established in 1958, when it was recognized that the recurrence rate and patient outcomes were directly related to the degree of tumor spread at the patient's initial presentation. Changes in understanding of tumor biology led to a recent update in the FIGO staging system that reflects the variation in treatment strategies between endometrial and cervical cancer. Patients with endometrial cancer are primarily treated with hysterectomy; thus, staging is done at surgery and histologic analysis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may accurately depict the extent of endometrial cancer at diagnosis and, in conjunction with the tumor grade and histologic subtype, help stratify risk, which determines the therapeutic course. Cervical carcinoma is staged at clinical examination because many tumors are inoperable at the time of patient presentation. Preoperative MR imaging criteria are not formally included in the revised FIGO staging system because cervical carcinoma is most prevalent in developing countries, where imaging resources are limited. However, MR imaging is highly sensitive and specific for depicting important prognostic factors and, when available, is recommended as an adjunct to clinical examination. The MR imaging findings of uterine carcinoma should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting in conjunction with clinical and histologic findings, an approach that provides accurate staging and risk stratification and allows for individualized treatment.

The in vitro recapitulation of tissue-like structures is meaningful, not only for fundamental cell biology research, but also for tissue engineering (TE). Currently, TE research adopts either the top-down or bottom-up approach. The top-down approach involves defining the macroscopic tissue features using biomaterial scaffolds and seeding cells into these scaffolds. Conversely, the bottom-up approach aims at crafting small tissue building blocks with precision-engineered structural and functional microscale features, using physical and/or chemical approaches. The bottom-up strategy takes advantage of the repeating structural and functional units that facilitate cell-cell interactions and cultures multiple cells together as a functional unit of tissue.

Despite of lacking a nucleus and genomic DNA, platelets possess diverse types of RNAs, ranging from protein coding messenger RNAs to small non-coding RNAs inherited from their parent megakaryocytes. Indeed, platelets are capable of using their own translational machinery to synthesise proteins upon their activation suggesting the possibility of post-transcriptional gene regulation in platelets. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, tiny non-coding RNAs exhibiting a fine-tune control of protein expression by complementary sequence recognition, binding and translational repression of protein coding mRNA transcripts. Multiple functional aspects of miRNAs as well as their expression in platelets or megakaryocytes underscore a role in platelet biology. Changes in miRNA expression patterns have been noted during platelet genesis and activation. In the present review we highlight recently identified megakaryocytic/platelet miRNAs and discuss their role in platelet biogenesis and functions essential to maintain haemostasis in the body.

To better understand their diffusion dynamics and membrane compartmentalization, we labeled lipid raft constituent ganglioside GM1 with single quantum dots through the connection of cholera toxin B subunit, a protein that binds specifically to GM1. Diffusion measurements revealed that single quantum dot-labeled GM1 ganglioside complexes undergo slow, confined lateral diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of similar to 7.87 X 10(-2) mu m(2)/s and a confinement domain about 200 nm in size. Further analysis of their trajectories showed lateral confinement persisting on the order of tens of seconds, comparable to the time scales of the majority of cellular signaling and biological reactions. Hence, our results provide further evidence in support of the putative function of lipid rafts as signaling platforms.

An ideal delivery system should encapsulate and protect the siRNA cargo from serum proteins, exhibit target tissue and cell specificity, penetrate the cell surface, and release its cargo in the desired intracellular compartment. One approach to the design of delivery vehicles that meets all of these requirements utilizes the systematic assembly of multiple components that can address each barrier. This rational approach was adopted by Ren et al., who designed novel myristoylated tandem peptides that consist of a tumor-targeting module and a cell-penetrating module, as described in this issue of ACS Nano. These tandem peptides were formulated with siRNAs into nanocomplexes for cell-specific delivery to a variety of tumor cell lines. The correlation of the structural properties of the nanocomplex to cell-type-specific activity via a computational approach identified the valence of the tumor-targeting ligand and overall nanocomplex charge as important parameters for the activity of the formulations. The in vivo gene silencing potency of these peptide-based nanocomplex formulations was demonstrated by Ren et al. in an ovarian cancer model. Tumor-penetrating nanocomplexes carrying a siRNA sequence against a novel oncogene (ID4) led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and an 80% increase in mouse survival. As such, the combination of a systematic approach with computational modeling can be advantageous for improving the delivery and potency of siRNA therapeutics.

The most significant challenge for using DNAzymes in vivo pertains to nontoxic delivery and maintaining function inside cells. We synthesized multivalent deoxyribozyme ""10-23"" gold nanoparticle (DzNP) conjugates, varying DNA density, linker length, enzyme orientation, and linker composition in order to study the role of the steric environment and gold surface chemistry on catalysis. DNAzyme catalytic efficiency was modulated by steric packing and pro.iimity of the active loop to the gold surface. Importantly, the 10-23 DNAzyme was asymmetrically sensitive to the gold surface and when anchored through the 5' terminus was nhibited 32-fold. This property was used to generate DNAzymes whose catalytic activity is triggered by thiol displacement reactions or by photoexcitation at lambda = 532 nm.

However, the use of plasmids imposes limitations on the size of synthetic gene circuits and the ease with which they can be placed into bacterial hosts. For instance, unique selective markers must be used for each plasmid to ensure their maintenance in the host. These selective markers are most often genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin or kanamycin. However, the simultaneous use of multiple antibiotics to retain different plasmids can place undue stress on the host and increase the cost of growth media. To address this problem, we have developed a method for stably transforming three different plasmids in E. colt using a single antibiotic selective marker. To do this, we first examined two different systems with which two plasmids may be maintained. These systems make use of either T7 RNA polymerase-specific regulation of the resistance gene or split antibiotic resistance enzymes encoded on separate plasmids. Finally, we combined the two methods to create system with which three plasmids can be transformed and stably maintained using a single selective marker. This work shows that large-scale plasmid-based synthetic gene circuits need not be limited by the use of multiple antibiotic resistance genes.

The synthetic gene regulatory circuit is designed to permanently alter gene expression in response to the well characterized inflammatory signal, nitric oxide. The detection of nitric oxide initiates the expression of a DNA recombinase, causing the permanent activation of a DNA switch. We demonstrate that E. coil containing this synthetic circuit respond to nitric oxide from both chemical and biological sources, with permanent DNA recombination occurring in the presence of nitric oxide donor compounds or inflamed mouse ileum explants. In the future, this synthetic genetic circuit will be optimized to allow E. coli to reliably detect and respond to inflammation in vivo.

The next generation of multigene circuits will control the triggering, amplitude, and duration of therapeutic activity in vivo. This will require a host organism that is easy to genetically modify, leverages existing successful circuit designs, and has the potential for use in humans.

While most synthetic gene networks have been explored within microbes, there is a need for further characterization of in vivo circuit behavior in the context of applications where the host microbes are actively being investigated for efficacy and safety, such as tumor drug delivery. One major hurdle is that culture-based selective pressures are absent in vivo, leading to strain-dependent instability of plasmid-based networks over time. Here, we experimentally characterize the dynamics of in vivo plasmid instability using attenuated strains of S. typhimurium and real time monitoring of luminescent reporters. Computational modeling described the effects of growth rate and dosage on live-imaging signals generated by internal bacterial populations.

Furthermore, we demonstrate a multiplexer-decoder circuit. The ribozymes are designed to seek-and-destroy specific RNAs with a certain length by a fully computerized procedure. The algorithm can accurately predict one base substitution that alters the ribozyme's logic function. The ability to sense the length of RNA molecules enables single ribozymes to be used as platforms for multiple interactions. These ribozymes can work as integrated circuits with the functionality of up to five logic gates. The ribozyme design is universal since the allosteric and substrate domains can be altered to sense different RNAs. In addition, the ribozymes can specifically cleave RNA molecules with triplet-repeat expansions observed in genetic disorders such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.

Virginia-type peanuts, harvested from plots treated with mineral salts combinations that mimic the subunit compositions of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) were analyzed for fatty acid and arachin compositions by HPLC and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. Fatty acid desaturase and arachin encoding mRNAs were analyzed by Northern hybridization using the homologous RNAs synthesized by peanut GDH as probes. There were 70-80 % sequence similarities between the GDH-synthesized RNAs and the mRNAs encoding arachins, fatty acid desaturases, glutamate synthase, and nitrate reductase, which similarities induced permutation of the metabolic pathways at the mRNA level. Modeling of mRNAs showed there were 210, 3,150, 1,260, 2,520, and 4,200 metabolic permutations in the control, NPKS-, NS-, Pi-, NH4Cl-, and PK-treated peanuts, respectively. The mRNA cross-talks decreased the arachin to almost zero percent in the NPKS- and PK-treated peanuts, and linoleate to similar to 18 % in the PK-treated peanut. The mRNA cross-talks may account for the vastly reported environmentally induced variability in the linoleate contents of peanut genotypes. These results have quantitatively unified molecular biology and metabolic pathways into one simple biotechnology for optimizing peanut quality and may encourage small-scale industry to produce arachin-free low linoleate peanuts.

This includes the study of the timing and relationships of the two major clades of extant mammals - marsupials and placenta's. Molecular studies concerned with marsupial and placental origin and diversification can be at odds with the fossil record. Such studies are, however, not a recent phenomenon. Over 150 years ago Charles Darwin weighed two alternative views on the origin of marsupials and placentals. Less than a year after the publication of On the origin of species, Darwin outlined these in a letter to Charles Lyell dated 23 September 1860. The letter concluded with two competing phylogenetic diagrams. One showed marsupials as ancestral to both living marsupials and placentals, whereas the other showed a non-marsupial, non-placental as being ancestral to both living marsupials and placentals. These two diagrams are published here for the first time. These are the only such competing phylogenetic diagrams that Darwin is known to have produced. In addition to examining the question of mammalian origins in this letter and in other manuscript notes discussed here, Darwin confronted the broader issue as to whether major groups of animals had a single origin (monophyly) or were the result of ""continuous creation"" as advocated for some groups by Richard Owen. Charles Lyell had held similar views to those of Owen, but it is clear from correspondence with Darwin that he was beginning to accept the idea of monophyly of major groups.

In Britain, the growth of biology followed T. H. Huxley's principle of teaching the characters of certain plants and animals selected as types of vegetable and animal organization, which brought demands for marine specimens for dissection. The history of the provision of such material in Britain is investigated, particularly apropos of the Marine Station at Millport. Supplementary information is presented on the equally long-standing specimen trade at Plymouth and on two small commercial concerns that supplied marine specimens (from the Isle of Luing and Shoreham-by-Sea). The demise of the specimen-supply trade in Britain in recent decades has resulted from curriculum changes in schools and universities no longer requiring students to do dissections (relating also to Health and Safety concerns about formalin-preserved material); and biology departments that can often no longer, as a result of financial stringency, afford the ""luxury"" of supplying students with the range of practical experiences that previous generations once valued so highly. The concern among some students about the ethics, or religious strictures, surrounding dissection is acknowledged.

Despite IDPs being present in all kingdoms of life, they are more abundant in eukaryotes where they are involved in the vast majority of regulation and signalling processes. The realization that, in some cases, functional states of proteins were partly or fully disordered was in contradiction to the traditional view where a well defined three-dimensional structure was required for activity. Several experimental evidences indicate, however, that structural features in IDPs such as transient secondary-structural elements and overall dimensions are crucial to their function. NMR has been the main tool to study IDP structure by probing conformational preferences at residue level. Additionally, SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) has the capacity to report on the three-dimensional space sampled by disordered states and therefore complements the local information provided by NMR. The present review describes how the synergy between NMR and SAXS can be exploited to obtain more detailed structural and dynamic models of IDPs in solution.

These so called IDPs (intrinsically disordered proteins) or intrinsically disordered regions constitute up to 40% of all expressed proteins, and a much higher percentage in proteins involved in the proliferation of cancer. For these proteins, there is a need to develop new methods for structural characterization which exploit their biophysical properties. IM (ion mobility)-MS is uniquely able to examine both absolute conformation(s), populations of conformation and also conformational change, and is therefore highly applicable to the study of IDPs. The present article details the technique of IM-MS and illustrates its use in assessing the relative disorder of the wild-type p53 DNA-core-binding domain of cellular tumour antigen p53. The IM data were acquired on a Waters Synapt HDMS instrument following nESI (nanoelectrospray ionization) from 'native' and low-pH solution conditions.

LRRK2 is a complex molecule containing domains implicated in protein interactions, as well as kinase and GTPase activities. The observation that the common G2019S mutation increases kinase activity in vitro suggests that altered phosphorylation of LRRK2 targets may have pathological outcomes. Given that protein kinases are ideal targets for drug therapies, much effort has been directed at understanding the role of LRRK2 kinase activity on disease onset. However, no clear physiological substrates have been identified to date, indicating that much research is still needed to fully understand the signalling pathways orchestrated by LRRK2 and deregulated under pathological conditions.

Substantial pre-clinical research and drug discovery efforts have focused on LRRK2 with the hope that small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme may be valuable for the treatment or prevention of the onset of PD. The pathway to develop therapeutic or neuroprotective agents based on LRRK2 function (i.e. kinase activity) has been facilitated by the development of both biochemical and cell-based assays for LRRK2. LRRK2 is phosphorylated on Ser(910), Ser(935), Ser(955) and Ser(973) in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme, and these sites of phosphorylation are likely to be regulated by upstream enzymes in an LRRK2 kinase-activity-dependent manner. Knowledge of these phosphorylation sites and their regulation can be adapted to high-throughput-screening-amenable platforms. The present review describes the utilization of LRRK2 phosphorylation as indicators of enzyme inhibition, as well as how such assays can be used to deconvolute the pathways in which LRRK2 plays a role.

We performed a thorough assessment of such research, evaluating urban wildlife publications from 16 leading journals in animal behavior, conservation, ecology, general science, landscape ecology, and wildlife biology from 1971 to 2010. Using a systematic review process, we quantified trends in urban wildlife research over time and in different scientific fields, and also assessed author affiliations, geographic and taxonomic focus, research topics, and study site types. In general, rates of publication for urban wildlife research have been increasing, although still remain low (<2% of publication volume) considering urban growth and its impacts on biodiversity are accelerating globally. Landscape ecology and wildlife biology journals, followed by conservation journals, published the highest percentage of urban wildlife publications, whereas such studies were rare in animal behavior, ecology, and general science journals. Academics were first-authors on ca. 75% of urban wildlife publications, whereas research directed by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private industry were less common, with little evidence of temporal shifts in these patterns. The majority of urban research studied birds or mammals, and nearly all was conducted in North America, Europe, or Australia, as expected given expansive urban development and associated research focus. Animal behavior was the most common scientific topic in urban wildlife research, followed by conservation, landscape ecology, wildlife management, and population ecology. While suburban and exurban development have been recently identified as an important issue, we found no evidence that research in these study systems has increased. Author affiliation, geographic location, taxonomic focus, and research topics of urban wildlife studies were generally similar to those conducted in non-urban systems, although avian studies were more common, and African and community ecology studies less common, in urban compared to non-urban areas. We suggest that the most critical gaps for urban wildlife researchers are in rapidly urbanizing areas in South America, Africa, and Asia, and on understudied taxa such as herpetiles, fish, and arthropods. Research conducted on multiple taxa and across continents is also rare, but will be necessary for global understanding of ecological dynamics of urban systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Limited tools are available for guiding the selection of translocation sites, however, particularly when establishing rescue populations outside of historic ranges. We developed a Bayesian network model framework for translocation site selection for island birds. The model consisted of four primary components including ecological requirements for survival, anthropogenic threats at the population establishment site, effects the translocated species may have on native species, and operational support associated with the translocation process and ongoing management. We then used the model to identify potential sites for the establishment of a wild population of Guam Micronesian kingfishers (Todiramphus cinnamominus cinnamominus) on an island outside the bird's historic range. Conditional probabilities that guided model evaluations were allocated using information from the literature, expert opinions, and a training set of islands outside the region under consideration for releases. The model was used to evaluate 239 islands where a translocation population of Micronesian kingfishers could be established. Five islands, all in the Federated States of Micronesia, were identified as being suitable for assisted colonization, including Kosrae, Yap, Faichuk, Weno and Fefan. Sensitivity analysis showed a correspondence between model variables and island characteristics indicated by the literature as being the most important for successful translocation. We found the Bayesian network model to be a useful tool for translocation site selection despite limited information on the natural history of the Guam Micronesian kingfisher and the factors that impact the success of translocations.

They inhibit the translation of proteins from mRNA or promote its degradation. Aberrant miRNA expression has been linked to various human diseases and measurement can differentiate between normal and diseased tissue. Expression is tissue-specific and any changes in miRNA expression within a tissue type can be correlated with disease status. Altered miRNA expression has been reported in the smoking-related diseases cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, miRNAs are thought to have vital roles in inflammatory cell differentiation and regulation. miRNAs might, therefore, be useful biomarkers for early detection of disease-related molecular and genetic changes. In this review, we summarize the available scientific evidence for the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers of smoking-related diseases. Studies should be carried out to identify the miRNAs most relevant to specific diseases.

However, recruitment in natural populations is highly variable and rarely well described by classical stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs). Recent analyses suggest that the age composition of the spawning biomass may play an important role in the mismatch between SRRs and data. Here we develop a generalization of the Ricker SRR that incorporates age structure by allowing mortality and fecundity rates to depend on maternal age. We provide a flexible SRR with biologically interpretable parameters that can be estimated from existing fisheries time series and use a Bayesian framework that enables parameters to be informed by experimental data. We apply our method to the Icelandic population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and show models that include age structure effects outperform the classical Ricker SRR that ignores age structure. Our results indicate a strong effect of spawning stock age structure on recruitment dynamics in this population. Our approach provides a biologically interpretable and immediately applicable method for investigating the consequences for spawning stock age structure on recruitment.

The determination of the stability of HO4- in water therefore has the greatest relevance for better understanding the mechanism associated with oxidative cascades in aqueous solution. However, experiments are difficult to perform because of the short-lived character of this species, and in this work we have employed DFT, CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS), MRCI/aug-cc-pVTZ, and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to investigate this topic. We show that the HO4- anion has a planar structure in the gas phase, with a very large HOO?OO bond length (1.823 angstrom). In contrast, HO4- adopts a nonplanar configuration in aqueous solution, with huge geometrical changes (up to 0.232 angstrom for the HOO?OO bond length) with a very small energy cost. The formation of the HO4- anion is predicted to be endergonic by 5.53 +/- 1.44 and 2.14 +/- 0.37 kcal?mol-1 with respect to the O3 + HO- and HO2 + O2- channels, respectively. Moreover, the combination of theoretical calculations with experimental free energies of solvation has allowed us to obtain accurate free energies for the main reactions involved in the aqueous decomposition of ozone. Thus, the oxygen transfer reaction (O3 + OH- ? HO2 + O2-) is endergonic by 3.39 +/- 1.80 kcal?mol-1, the electron transfer process (O3 + O2- ? O3- + O2) is exergonic by 31.53 +/- 1.05 kcal?mol-1, supporting the chain-carrier role of the superoxide ion, and the reaction O3 + HO2- ? OH + O2- + O2 is exergonic by 12.78 +/- 1.15 kcal?mol-1, which is consistent with the fact that the addition of small amounts of HO2- (through H2O2) accelerates ozone decomposition in water. The combination of our results with previously reported thermokinetic data provides some insights into the potentially important role of the HO4- anion as a key reaction intermediate.

Nitrogen mineralization is the important process transferred from organic nitrogen to plant-available inorganic forms by soil animals and microorganism. Soil nitrogen mineralization processes in coastal wetlands will be greatly impacted by the significant changes of soil water and salt conditions caused by global climate change in the future. However, further studies concerning the effects of water and salt on soil nitrogen mineralization is still needed. The influences of other soil physicalchemical properties and plant community on soil nitrogen mineralization processes are also concluded. The influencing mechanism of soil nitrogen mineralization can be explained using the laboratory incubation, whereas the in situ incubation can contribute to reflecting the real nitrogen mineralization information in the field. The laboratory and in situ incubation methods combined with 15N tracing-isotope technique should be combined and applied to better reflect and explain soil nitrogen mineralization processes. Moreover, the applications of modern molecular biology techniques are also very necessary to quantitatively and accurately study nitrogen mineralization.

Yet, the reproductive biology of many deep-water corals, especially members of the subclass Octocorallia, has not been examined. We used histological techniques to describe the reproductive biology of the deep-water gorgonian coral Acanella arbuscula from the northwest Atlantic. All colonies examined were gonochoric, and no embryos or planula larvae were observed in the polyps. Mean polyp-level fecundity (females: 21.0 +/- 17.5 oocytes polyp(-1), and males: 13.9 +/- 13.5 sperm sacs polyp(-1)) is high compared to other deep-water gorgonians, and polyps closer to the branch tips had the highest fecundities in both females and males. The presence of large oocytes (maximum diameter 717.8 mu m) suggests that A. nrbuscula produces lecithotrophic larvae. Despite the potentially high fecundity and small size at first reproduction, the paucity of information on dispersal and recruitment, combined with its longevity, vulnerability to bottom fishing gear, and ecological role as a structure-forming species, still warrants the classification of A. arbuscula as a vulnerable marine ecosystem indicator.

The development, homeostasis, and effector functions of basophils are tightly regulated by extrinsic signals and in particular by cytokines. IL-3, GM-CSF, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin activate the STAT5 pathway that promotes proliferation, activation, and cytokine secretion but also induces a negative feedback loop via Pim-1 and SOCS proteins. Basophils further express receptors for IL-18 and IL-33, which are associated with the signaling adaptor MyD88 and activate the NF-?B and MAP kinase pathways.

Depending primarily on the material of the structures various methods exist to create functional layers of simple chemical groups, biological macromolecules or metal nanoparticles. Here an effective coating method is demonstrated and evaluated on SU-8 based 3D microstructures made by two-photon polymerization. Protein streptavidin and gold nanoparticles (NP) were bound to the microstructures utilizing acid treatment-mediated csilane chemistry. The protein surface density, quantified with single molecule fluorescence microscopy revealed that the protein forms a third of a monolayer on the two-photon polymerized structures. The surface coverage of the gold NPs on the microstructures was simply controlled with a single parameter. The possible degrading effect of the acid treatment on the sub-micrometer features of the TPP microstructures was analyzed.

In testing decontamination products, we found that dish liquid detergent was the most effective, followed by bleach, Virkon, and salt. Decontaminants were more effective on cells that were not still attached to their stalks. From the fishermen's perspective, didymo was the aquatic invasive species of highest concern, but there was a wide range of approaches to didymo control.

Patients with breast cancer were examined for pathologic factors predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, using an anthracycline-based regimen. For clinical histomorphology and biomarkers, factors were compared among 16 pathologically complete responses and 52 nonpathologically complete responses, using upivariate analysis and multivariate regression analysis of principal components, using preneoadjuvant chemotherapy needle biopsy samples as follows: degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, histologic grade, biology-based tumor type (hormone receptors and HER2 [human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2]), age, clinical TNM stage, and TNM staging. In univariate analysis, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, high histologic grade, and hormone receptors(-)/HER2(+) were significantly associated with pathologically complete responses (93.7%, P < .0001; 81.3%, P = .0206; 43.7%, P = .014, respectively). In multivariate principal component regression analysis, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were the best independent predictor for pathologically complete responses (odds ratio, 4.7; confidence interval, 2.2-10.06; P < .0001). Among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and biology-based tumor types, patients with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had pathologically complete responses more than nonpathologically complete responses, especially in the hormone receptors(-)/HER2(+) group. Among high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cases, T lymphocytes showed more predominant tendency than B lymphocytes in the pathologically complete responses cases, compared with nonpathologically complete responses cases. These findings indicate that high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are important predictors of pathologically complete responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially in the hormone receptors(-)/HER2(+) group.

We show here that the CD8(+) subset of splenic dendritic cells (DC), specialized in major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) presentation of exogenous antigens (cross-presentation), produce high levels of Sb9. Mice deficient in Sb9 are unable to generate a cytotoxic T-cell response against cell-associated antigen by cross-presentation, but maintain normal MHC-II presentation to helper T cells. This impaired cross-priming ability is autonomous to DC and is evident in animals deficient in both Sb9 and GrB, indicating that this role of Sb9 in DC is GrB-independent. In Sb9-deficient mice, CD8(+) DC develop normally, survive as well as wild-type DC after antigenic challenge, and exhibit unimpaired capacity to take up antigen. Although the core processing machinery is unaffected, Sb9-deficient DC appear to process antigen faster. Our results point to a novel, GrB-independent role for Sb9 in DC cross-priming.

In this review, we focus on the role of the T lineage-enriched chromatin organizer and regulator SATB1 in T-cell differentiation. SATB1 mediates Wnt signaling by recruiting beta-catenin to its genomic targets and coordinates T helper type 2 (T(H)2) differentiation by positively regulating GATA-3. In contrast, maintenance of regulatory T cell (Treg) functions are dependent on inhibition of SATB1-mediated modulation of global chromatin organization. We discuss how regulation of the activity of SATB1 has a critical role in driving these two important differentiation pathways in T cells.

Formulating mechanistic mathematical models combining regulatory networks at the transcriptional, translational and epigenetic level, we study how individual helper T cells may adopt their different phenotypes. For each cytokine phenotype, for example, T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 2 (Th2) cells, we find that the intracellular molecular network allows a cell to adopt one of the three states, which we interpret as naive, active and memory states. Cell division markedly speeds up the differentiation into a particular memory state because of DNA demythelation. In a memory state, cells readily resume production of the same cytokine they produced before. Using stochastic models we show that helper T-cell plasticity (that is, the ability to switch phenotype) is low during clonal expansion. Although most memory cells rapidly secrete the original cytokine upon restimulation, some adopt another phenotype and produce different cytokines, allowing for considerable diversity in the phenotypes that are adopted during a memory response. In summary, we show that helper T-cell division expedites cell differentiation by increasing DNA demethylation. We also show that plasticity is low during the clonal expansion phase, but that helper T cells may adopt alternative phenotypes during a memory response.

It is therefore unexpected that complement-deficient animals are less susceptible to carcinogen-induced tumours and more readily control growth of injected tumour cell lines than their wild-type counterparts, implying that complement promotes tumour development and progression. Conversely, natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cells are known to limit progression of the same tumours. Previous studies indicate that sublytic levels of the complement membrane attack complex protect cells against further attack by lytic doses of complement and other pore-formers such as perforin. We hypothesise that inefficient attack by complement in vivo allows tumour cells to avoid lysis by both NK cells and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, thereby promoting tumour outgrowth. Complement could thus be limiting the efficacy of NK and T cell-targeted cancer therapies, and the inclusion of complement inhibitors could optimise these immunotherapeutic regimes.

Here, we have conducted a comprehensive ex vivo profiling of CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in a cohort of GBM patients. Of the patients analyzed, approximately half exhibited serological evidence of past infection with CMV. Although no CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses could be detected in the serologically negative GBM patients, virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected in all seropositive GBM patients. Using major histocompatibility complex-peptide multimers, the frequency of CMV-specific T-cells in the patients detected ranged from 0.1 to 22% of CD8(+) T-cells and a high proportion of these cells were positive for the human natural killer-1 glycoprotein CD57. Furthermore, ex vivo polychromatic functional analysis of the CMV-specific T-cells from GBM patients revealed that large proportions of these cells were unable to produce multiple cytokines (macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interferon (IFN)gamma) and displayed limited cytolytic function (CD107a mobilization) following stimulation with CMV peptide epitopes. However, in vitro stimulation with CMV peptide epitopes in the presence of gamma C cytokine dramatically reversed the polyfunctional profile of these antigen-specific T-cells with high levels of MIP-1 beta, TNF alpha, IFN gamma and CD107a mobilization. Most importantly, adoptive transfer of these in vitro-expanded T-cells in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) therapy into a patient with recurrent GBM was coincident with a long-term disease-free survival. These studies provide an important platform for a formal assessment of combination therapies based on CMV-specific T-cells and TMZ for recurrent GBM.

We have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (Traf)2(-/-) mice spontaneously develop severe colitis and that the development of colitis largely depends on TNF alpha-dependent apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the immunological disorders of Traf2(-/-) mice are not fully understood. Here we show that interleukin (IL)-10-secreting neutrophils accumulated in peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) cells from Traf2(-/-) mice compared with those from wild-type mice. Treatment of Traf2(-/-) mice with neutralizing antibody against TNF alpha or crossing Traf2(-/-) mice with Tnfr1(-/-) mice reduced the percentages of IL-10-secreting neutrophils, suggesting that the development of IL-10-secreting neutrophils largely depended on TNF alpha signals. Moreover, stimulation of BM cells from wild-type mice with lipopolysaccharide and Pam3CS(K)4, a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 and 2, respectively, induced differentiation of BM cells into IL-10-secreting neutrophils. These results suggest that the development of IL-10-secreting neutrophils is not restricted to Traf2(-/-) mice, but could be generalized to wild-type mice under certain conditions such as inflammation. Finally, combined treatment of Traf2(-/-) mice with neutralizing antibodies against TNF alpha and IL-10, but not each antibody alone, substantially ameliorated colitis and prolonged survival. Together, abrogation of immunosuppressive conditions mediated by IL-10-secreting neutrophils might be an alternative strategy to treat chronic inflammatory diseases at least under certain conditions.

This study identified an unusual pattern of reciprocal expression of Mincle on peripheral blood monocytes or neutrophils isolated from the same donor. Expression on monocytes was inversely correlated with phagocytosis and yeast killing, but was necessary for the induction of inflammatory cytokines in response to ex vivo Candida challenge. In contrast, Mincle expression on neutrophils was associated with phagocytic and candidacidal potential of those cells. Candida challenge upregulated Mincle expression but only in Mincle+ cells. These data highlight species-specific differences between the regulation of Mincle expression in mouse and man. Reciprocal expression of Mincle modified the candidacidal potential of monocytes or neutrophils, suggesting it may also polarize the type of host response to fungal infection.

Ii associates with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and targets the complex in the endocytic pathway to allow antigenic peptide loading. The human Iip35 isoform includes a cytoplasmic extension containing a di-arginine motif causing ER retention. This minor isoform does not exist in mice and its function in humans has not been thoroughly investigated. We have recently generated transgenic mice expressing Iip35 and these were crossed with Ii-deficient mice to generate animals (Tgp35/mIiKO) expressing exclusively the human isoform. In these mice, we show that Iip35 is expressed in antigen presenting cells and is inducible by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Despite the low constitutive expression of the protein and some minor differences in the V beta repertoire of Tgp35/mIiKO mice, Iip35 restored thymic selection of CD4(+) T cells and of invariant natural killer T cells. In vitro functional assays using purified primary macrophages treated with IFN-gamma showed that Iip35 allows presentation of an Ii-dependent ovalbumin T-cell epitope. Altogether, our results suggest that Iip35 is functional and does not require co-expression of other isoforms for antigen presentation.

To understand the mechanisms of PI3K regulation during B-cell activation, we performed a series of biochemical analysis on primary B cells, and found that activity of Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) is crucial for the activation of PI3K following BCR ligation and this is regulated by the SFK Lyn. We show that the hyperresponsive phenotype of B cells lacking Lyn is predicated on significantly increased basal and inducible PI3K activity that correlates with the constitutive hypophosphorylation of PAG/Cbp (phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk-binding protein), a concomitant reduction in bound Csk in Lyn(-/-) B cells and elevated levels of active Fyn. Regulating SFK activity may thus be a central mechanism by which Lyn regulates PI3K activity in B cells. This study defines the molecular connection between the BCR and PI3K and reveals this to be a point of Lyn-mediated regulation.

The route by which circulating Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites cross the vascular endothelium to enter the human retina is unknown. Convincing studies using murine encephalitis models have strongly implicated leukocyte taxis as one pathway used by the parasite to access target organs. To establish whether tachyzoites might also interact directly with vascular endothelium, we populated a transwell system with human ocular endothelial cells. Human retinal endothelial monolayers permitted transmigration of tachyzoites of RH and three natural isolate strains. Antibody blockade of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 significantly reduced this migration, but did not impact tachyzoite movement across an endothelial monolayer derived from the choroid, which lies adjacent to the retina within the eye. In demonstrating that tachyzoites are capable of independent migration across human vascular endothelium in vitro, this study carries implications for the development of therapeutics aimed at preventing access of T. gondii to the retina.

However, the lack of RNA-specific modeling techniques demands the development of new tools for RNA-targeted rational drug design. Herein, we implemented integrated approaches of accurate RNA modeling and virtual screening for RNA inhibitor discovery with the most comprehensive evaluation to date of five docking and 11 scoring methods. For the first time, statistical analysis was heavily employed to assess the significance of our predictions. We found that GOLD:GOLD Fitness and rDock:rDock_solv could accurately predict the RNA ligand poses, and ASP rescoring further improved the ranking of ligand binding poses. Due to the weak correlations (R-2 < 0.3) of existing scoring with experimental binding affinities, we implemented two new RNA-specific scoring functions, iMDLScore1 and iMDLScore2, and obtained better correlations with R-2 = 0.70 and 0.79, respectively. We also proposed a multistep virtual screening approach and demonstrated that rDock:rDock_solv together with iMDLScore2 rescoring obtained the best enrichment on the flexible RNA targets, whereas GOLD:GOLD Fitness combined with rDock_solv rescoring outperformed other methods for rigid RNAs. This study provided practical strategies for RNA modeling and offered new insights into RNA small molecule interactions for drug discovery.

In this study, the expression of C19MC-MIR371-3 clusters and the molecular mechanisms presiding their modulation were investigated in a series of six normal parathyroids, 24 adenomas (Ad), 15 Ca and five matched metastases. The general expression levels of C19MC or MIR371-3 clusters in Ad lesions did not differ from normal glands, while they distinguished Ad from Ca at unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis (P=0.0008). MIR517C showed the most significant difference in expression between Ca and Ad (P=0.0003) and it positively correlated with serum calcium, parathormone and tumour weight. In regard to the molecular mechanism determining C19MC cluster activation, we could detect C19MC copy number (CN) gain in ten Ca (67%) extending distal to the MIR371-3 cluster in almost all samples. Conversely, only four Ad (16%) showed C19MC amplification, with one case presenting distal genomic aberration to MIR371-3. Globally, CN variations of 19q13.4 loci were significantly associated with MIR517C up-regulation (P=0.006). Opposite to normal glands where C19MC promoter was methylated, hypomethylation occurred in 15 out of 30 analysed tumours. Though the epigenetic status did not correlate with C19MC miRNA expression levels, loss of C19MC promoter methylation was significantly associated with Ca and metastatic disease (P=0.01). In conclusion, C19MC cluster aberrations are a characteristic of Ca with respect to Ad. Altogether, these evidences point towards a role for 19q13.4 miRNA clusters as oncogenes in parathyroid tumourigenesis.

Diverse bioinformatics tools have been developed to help unravel these mechanisms, by handling and processing data at different stages: from data collection and storage to the identification of molecular targets and from the detection of DNA motif signatures in the regulatory sequences of functionally related genes to the identification of relevant regulatory networks. Moreover, the large amount of genome-wide scale data recently produced has attracted professionals from diverse backgrounds to this cutting-edge realm of molecular biology. This mini-review is intended as an orientation for multidisciplinary professionals, introducing a streamlined workflow in gene transcription regulation with emphasis on sequence analysis.

Likewise, proteomics can provide important functional information regarding biosynthetic pathways, as well as insights into mechanism of action, of novel marine natural products. The goal of this review is to (1) explore the application of proteomics methodologies to marine systems, (2) assess the technical approaches that have been used, and (3) evaluate the pros and cons of this proteomic research, with the intent of providing a critical analysis of its future roles in marine sciences. To date, proteomics techniques have been utilized to investigate marine microbe, plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate physiology, developmental biology, seafood safety, susceptibility to disease, and responses to environmental change. However, marine proteomics studies often suffer from poor experimental design, sample processing/optimization difficulties, and data analysis/interpretation issues. Moreover, a major limitation is the lack of available annotated genomes and proteomes for most marine organisms, including several ""model species"". Even with these challenges in mind, there is no doubt that marine proteomics is a rapidly expanding and powerful integrative molecular research tool from which our knowledge of the marine environment, and the natural products from this resource, will be significantly expanded.

In this study, we describe the eggs of Malacopsylla grossiventris and Phthiropsylla agenoris and compare their surface ultrastructure using scanning electron microscopy. Eggs of both flea species are similar in their general appearance, i.e., the presence of disks and absence of lateral aeropyles, but they differ in size, texture of the surface, and number of micropyles and aeropyles. In addition, the eggs of M. grossiventris and P. agenoris are larger (719-800 mu m) than most of the flea eggs known (<600 pi m), and the length/width ratio is 2.0, while it varies between 1.6 and 1.8 in other species. As opposed to other large species, malacopsyllids have expandable (telescoping) abdomens that display growth. It is possible that a clutch of eggs has more than 2 eggs. Females of M. grossiventris were observed fixed with their mouthparts to the skin of their hosts. Indeed, some of these specimens were observed copulating on the venter of their hosts.

Although seaweeds are known to be vulnerable to physical and chemical changes in the marine environment, the impacts of ongoing and future anthropogenic climate change in seaweed-dominated ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe the ways in which changes in the environment directly affect seaweeds in terms of their physiology, growth, reproduction, and survival. We consider the extent to which seaweed species may be able to respond to these changes via adaptation or migration. We also examine the extensive reshuffling of communities that is occurring as the ecological balance between competing species changes, and as top-down control by herbivores becomes stronger or weaker. Finally, we delve into some of the ecosystem-level responses to these changes, including changes in primary productivity, diversity, and resilience. Although there are several key areas in which ecological insight is lacking, we suggest that reasonable climate-related hypotheses can be developed and tested based on current information. By strategically prioritizing research in the areas of complex environmental variation, multiple stressor effects, evolutionary adaptation, and population, community, and ecosystem-level responses, we can rapidly build upon our current understanding of seaweed biology and climate change ecology to more effectively conserve and manage coastal ecosystems.

This characteristic suggests the possibility of exploiting species from this group as renewable sources for jet fuel. An oil-rich strain of Botryococcus (Trebouxiophyceae) was isolated from a freshwater pond in the state of Bahia, Brazil, and is presently maintained under standard conditions at the Culture Collection of the Institute of Biology, Federal University of Bahia. The taxonomic classification of the species was based on light microscopy (LM); and TEM and SEM were used to better characterize its features, which have never before been described at this level. The LM characterization included the size of the colonies (35.7157 mu m) and cells (810 x 59 mu m) and their connection in sub-colonies by mucilaginous strands, as well as the presence of mucilaginous processes on the periphery of some of the colonies, with most of the cells included inside the colony. Reproduction occurred through divisions into two to four autospores. These features characterized the species as Botryococcus terribilis Komarek and Marvan. The TEM study showed, in addition to the presence of starch grains, pyrenoids that are penetrated by thick thylakoids. The pyrenoid bodies appear as electron-dense protein inclusions located in the chloroplast and surrounded by a starch sheath.

The SAXS experiments yield one-dimensional profile that needs further analysis to reveal structural information. The pair distance distribution function (PDDF), P(r), can provide molecular structures more intuitively, and it can be used to guide ab initio model reconstructions, making it a critical step to derive P(r) from experimental SAXS profiles. To calculate the P(r) curves, a new method based on a specially designed parametric functional form is developed, and implemented in pregxs. This method is tested against both synthetic and experimental data, the estimated P(r) functions are in good agreement with correct or known P(r). The method can also predict the molecular size.

Of all 91 patients 49% were stage 1,21% stage II and 30% stage IIIA. Forty-seven percent of the patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 36% adenocarcinoma and 17% large cell carcinoma. All patients were R0 resected.Results: GST-PI mRNA expression could be measured in 100% in both (T and N) tissues; GST-PI DNA methylation was detected in 14% (N) and 14% (T). The median GST-PI mRNA expression in N was 7.83 (range: 0.01-19.43) and in T 13.15 (range: 0.01-116.8; p <= 0.001). The median GST-PI methylation was not significantly different between land N. No associations were seen between the mRNA expression or DNA methylation levels and clinical or histopathologic parameters such as gender, age, TNM stage, tumor histology and grading. The median survival of the investigated patients was 59.7 years (the median follow-up was 85.9 months). High GST-PI DNA methylation was significantly associated with a worse prognosis (p = 0.041, log rank test). No correlation was found between the GST-PI DNA methylation levels and the correlating mRNA expression levels.Conclusion: GST-PI mRNA expression seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. High levels of GST-PI DNA methylation in tumor tissue of NSCLC patients have a potential as a biomarker identifying subpopulations with a more aggressive tumor biology. Quantitation of GST-PI DNA methylation may be a useful method to identify patients with a poor prognosis after curative resection and who will benefit from intensive adjuvant therapy.

Whether HR on admission could be correlated and perhaps participate to inflammation has not been reported. Methods: Between March 2007 and February 2010, we conducted a retrospective study on all patients admitted to our center for acute pericarditis. Diagnosis criteria included two of the following ones: typical chest pain, friction rub, pericardial effusion on cardiac echography, or typical electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. Primary end-point was biology: CRP on admission, on days 1, 2, 3, and especially peak. Results: We included 73 patients. Median age was 38 years (interquartiles 28-51) and median hospitalization duration was 2.0 days (1.5-3.0). Median heart rate was 88.0 beats per minute (bpm) on admission (interquartiles 76.0-100.0) and 72.0 on discharge (65.0-80.0). Heart rate on admission was significantly correlated with CRP peak (p < 0.001), independently of temperature on admission, hospitalization duration and age. Recurrences occurred within 1 month in 32% of patients. Heart rate on hospital discharge was correlated with recurrence, independently of age. Conclusion: In acute pericarditis, heart rate on admission is independently correlated with CRP levels and heart rate on discharge seems to be independently correlated to recurrence. This could suggest a link between heart rate and pericardial inflammation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study uses scale-invariant microvascular morphological quantification to track vessel maturation and remodeling in a split-thickness skin-grafting model over 21 days, comparing the results to classical techniques. Methods: Images from a previous study of split-thickness skin grafting in rats were analyzed. Microvascular morphology (fractal and multifractal dimensions, lacunarity, and vessel density) within fibrin interfaces of samples over time was quantified using classical semi-automated methods and automated multifractal and lacunarity analyses. Results: Microvessel morphology increased in density and complexity, from three to seven days after engraftment and then regressed by 21 days. Vessel density increased from 0.07 on day 3 to 0.20 on day 7 and then decreased to 0.06 on day 21. A similar trend was seen for the fractal dimension that increased from 1.56 at three days to 1.77 at seven days then decreased to 1.57 by 21 days. Vessel diameters did not change whereas complexity and density did, signaling remodeling. Conclusions: This new automated analysis identified design parameters for tissue engraftment and could be used in other models of graft vessel biology to track proliferation and pruning of complex vessel beds.

This wide range may reflect differences in the efficacy of selection due to differences in the effective population size (N-e). However, most comparisons have been made among distantly related organisms that differ not only in N-e but also in many other aspects of their biology. Here, we estimate alpha in three closely related lineages of house mice that have a similar ecology but differ widely in N-e: Mus musculus musculus (N-e similar to 25,000-120,000), M. m. domesticus (N-e similar to 58,000-200,000), and M. m. castaneus (N-e similar to 200,000-733,000). Mice were genotyped using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array, and the proportions of replacement and silent mutations within subspecies were compared with those fixed between each subspecies and an outgroup, Mus spretus. There was significant evidence of positive selection in M. m. castaneus, the lineage with the largest N-e, with alpha estimated to be approximately 40%. In contrast, estimates of alpha for M. m. domesticus (alpha = 13%) and for M. m. musculus (alpha = 12 %) were much smaller. Interestingly, the higher estimate of alpha for M. m. castaneus appears to reflect not only more adaptive fixations but also more effective purifying selection. These results support the hypothesis that differences in N-e contribute to differences among species in the efficacy of selection.

However, an early study of the pike cichlid's visual system suggested a lack of short-wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors, a surprising finding as many African cichlids have highly developed short-wavelength vision. In this study, we found evidence for only four expressed cone opsins (LWS, RH2a, SWS2a, and SWS2b), plus one pseudogene (RH2b). Taken together with our microspectrophotometry data, which revealed the presence of three types of cone photoreceptor, including one sensitive to short-wavelength light, this would indicate a broader spectral capacity than previously believed from earlier visual studies of this fish. Relative to the highly diverse African cichlids, however, this Neotropical cichlid appears to have a greatly reduced opsin complement, reflecting both gene loss along the Neotropical lineage (lacking functional RH2b and, possibly, SWS1 opsins) and gene duplication within the African clade (which possesses paralogous RH2a alpha and RH2a beta opsins). Molecular evolutionary analyses show that positive selection has shaped the SWS2b and RH1 opsins along the Neotropical lineage, which may be indicative of adaptive evolution to alter nonspectral aspects of opsin biology. These results represent the first molecular evolutionary study of visual pigments in a Neotropical cichlid and thus provide a foundation for further study of a morphologically and ecologically diverse clade that has been understudied with respect to the link between visual ecology and diversification.

Yet the genetic and genomic architectures that produce genetic variation to enable environmental adaptation have remained poorly understood. Here we show that the proportion of duplicated genes (P-D) in the whole genomes of fully sequenced Drosophila species is significantly correlated with environmental variability within the habitats measured by the climatic envelope and habitat diversity. Furthermore, species with a low P-D tend to lose the duplicated genes owing to their faster evolution. These results indicate that the rapid relaxation of functional constraints on duplicated genes resulted in a low P-D for species with lower habitat diversity, and suggest that the maintenance of duplicated genes gives organisms an ecological advantage during evolution. We therefore propose that the P-D in a genome is related to adaptation to environmental variation.

Several T6SS components are proposed to be part of a macromolecular complex resembling the bacteriophage tail. The T6SS protein HsiE1 (TagJ) is unique to the H1-T6SS and absent from the H2- and H3-T6SSs. We demonstrate that HsiE1 interacts with a predicted N-terminal a-helix in HsiB1 (TssB) thus forming a novel subcomplex of the T6SS. HsiB1 is homologous to the Vibrio cholerae VipA component, which contributes to the formation of a bacteriophage tail sheath-like structure. We show that the interaction between HsiE1 and HsiB1 is specific and does not occur between HsiE1 and HsiB2. Proteins of the TssB family encoded in T6SS clusters lacking a gene encoding a TagJ-like component are often devoid of the predicted N-terminal helical region, which suggests co-evolution. We observe that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 20 amino acids of HsiB1 interacts with purified HsiE1 protein. This interaction is a common feature to other bacterial T6SSs that display a TagJ homologue as shown here with Serratia marcescens. We further show that hsiE1 is a non-essential gene for the T6SS and suggest that HsiE1 may modulate incorporation of HsiB1 into the T6SS.

Because of the distribution of many Lecanorchis taxa in various climate conditions, we hypothesized that mycorrhizal diversity and specificity are different among the different taxa of Lecanorchis. In the present study, identities of mycorrhizal fungi were examined for 90 individuals of 10 Lecanorchis taxa at 26 sites from Niigata to Okinawa Prefectures in Japan. Phylogenetic analyses of Lecanorchis taxa based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) divided the examined Lecanorchis taxa into three groups, groups A, B, and C. ITS rDNA sequences suggested that fungi associating with Lecanorchis were ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi in Lactarius, Russula, Atheliaceae, and Sebacina, with Lactarius and Russula dominant. Our results suggested some degree of mycorrhizal specialization among Lecanorchis taxa. Interestingly, the Lecanorchis group C had some specific relationships with Lactarius, whereas less specificity was found in the relationships with Russula. However, observed specificity results may be biased by geographic opportunity, and we suggest further research to assess whether Lecanorchis species are limited to the associations we observed.

Whether amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is also characterized by a presymptomatic period, and if so how long this period lasts, is unclear. Answers to these questions will not only inform our understanding of disease biology and potential environmental risk factors for ALS, but also the design and implementation of early therapeutic and even preventative clinical trials. Moreover, the potential impact of studying people at genetic risk for ALS, the only population in which it is currently possible to study presymptomatic disease, is underscored by recent progress in our understanding of the shared genetic basis of familial and apparently sporadic ALS. Studying presymptomatic ALS, however, has proven difficult due to the challenge in identifying an at-risk population and various logistical and ethical considerations. In this article we present the rationale for studying presymptomatic ALS, summarize the early evidence supporting the existence of a presymptomatic phase of the disease, and discuss the challenges of studying presymptomatic ALS.

Specifically, a library of mutant pathways is created by de novo assembly of promoter mutants of varying strengths for each pathway gene in a target organism followed by high-throughput screening/selection. To demonstrate this approach, a single round of COMPACTER was used to generate both a xylose utilizing pathway with near-highest efficiency and a cellobiose utilizing pathway with highest efficiency that were ever reported in literature for both laboratory and industrial yeast strains. Interestingly, these engineered xylose and cellobiose utilizing pathways were all host-specific.

Although the details of target hub regulation remain poorly understood, recent experiments suggest that pairs of miRNAs can cooperate if their binding sites reside in close proximity. To test this and other hypotheses, we established a novel approach to investigate mechanisms of collective miRNA repression. The approach presented here combines miRNA target prediction and transcription factor prediction with data from the literature and databases to generate a regulatory map for a chosen target hub. We then show how a kinetic model can be derived from the regulatory map. To validate our approach, we present a case study for p21, one of the first experimentally proved miRNA target hubs. Our analysis indicates that distinctive expression patterns for miRNAs, some of which interact cooperatively, fine-tune the features of transient and long-term regulation of target genes. With respect to p21, our model successfully predicts its protein levels for nine different cellular functions. In addition, we find that high abundance of miRNAs, in combination with cooperativity, can enhance noise buffering for the transcription of target hubs.

However, these 3D structures have rarely been applied to constructing efficient molecular devices that function in living cells. Here, we demonstrate a 3D structure-based molecular design principle for constructing short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated genetic information converters; these converters respond to specific proteins and trigger the desired gene expression by modulating the function of the RNA-processing enzyme Dicer. The inhibitory effect on Dicer cleavage against the shRNA designed to specifically bind to U1A spliceosomal protein was correlated with the degree of steric hindrance between Dicer and the shRNA-protein complex in vitro: The level of the hindrance was predicted based on the models. Moreover, the regulation of gene expression was achieved by using the shRNA converters designed to bind to the target U1A or nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p50 proteins expressed in human cells. The 3D molecular design approach is widely applicable for developing new devices in synthetic biology.

A variant in the 3'UTR of the KRAS oncogene, referred to as the KRAS variant, is associated with both cancer risk and altered tumor biology. Here, we test the hypothesis that the KRAS variant can act as a biomarker of outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and investigate the cause of altered outcome in KRAS variant-positive EOC patients. As this variant seems to be associated with tumor biology, we additionally test the hypothesis that this variant can be directly targeted to impact cell survival. EOC patients with complete clinical data were genotyped for the KRAS variant and analyzed for outcome (n = 536), response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 25) and platinum resistance (n = 306). Outcome was separately analyzed for women with known BRCA mutations (n = 79). Gene expression was analyzed on a subset of tumors with available tissue. Cell lines were used to confirm altered sensitivity to chemotherapy associated with the KRAS variant. Finally, the KRAS variant was directly targeted through small-interfering RNA/miRNA oligonucleotides in cell lines and survival was measured. Postmenopausal EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to die of ovarian cancer by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.57, P = 0.019, n = 279). Perhaps explaining this finding, EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to be platinum resistant (odds ratio 3.18, confidence interval: 1.31-7.72, P = 0.0106, n = 291). In addition, direct targeting of the KRAS variant led to a significant reduction in EOC cell growth and survival in vitro. These findings confirm the importance of the KRAS variant in EOC, and indicate that the KRAS variant is a biomarker of poor outcome in EOC likely due to platinum resistance. In addition, this study supports the hypothesis that these tumors have continued dependence on such 3'UTR lesions, and that direct targeting may be a viable future treatment approach.

Climate change may result in elevated temperatures affecting trematode transmission. Therefore understanding their thermobiology forms an important step in determining the future dynamics of parasite populations. An empirical relationship exists between the mean expected life span of lecithotrophic larvae and the half life of their population (t(0.5)) and therefore t(0.5) is a good indicator of glycogen utilization. In this study experimental data on the effects of temperature on miracidial survival were compiled from the scientific literature and evaluated in terms of metabolism using Q(10) and Arrhenius activation energy (E* or mu). Temperature poorly influenced survival/metabolism with all miracidia having distinct zone(s) of thermostability. Overall there were few differences in Q(10) and E* values between most species temperature ranges whilst there were only limited strain-specific variations in thermal responses of laboratory-maintained Schistosoma mansoni. Miracidia demonstrated a trend of greater thermal resistance than cercariae. In particular, comparative studies on 4 strains of the same species of miracidia and cercariae showed little correlation in thermal biology between the 2 life-history stages. The importance of these results for trematode transmission under global climate change is discussed. ", Parasitology 10.1152/physrev.00038.2011,ION CHANNELS IN PLANTS,"Abstract: Hedrich R. Ion Channels in Plants. Physiol Rev 92: 1777-1811, 2012; doi:10.1152/physrev.00038.2011.-Since the first recordings of single potassium channel activities in the plasma membrane of guard cells more than 25 years ago, patch-clamp studies discovered a variety of ion channels in all cell types and plant species under inspection. Their properties differed in a cell type- and cell membrane-dependent manner. Guard cells, for which the existence of plant potassium channels was initially documented, advanced to a versatile model system for studying plant ion channel structure, function, and physiology. Interestingly, one of the first identified potassium-channel genes encoding the Shaker-type channel KAT1 was shown to be highly expressed in guard cells. KAT1-type channels from Arabidopsis thaliana and its homologs from other species were found to encode the K+-selective inward rectifiers that had already been recorded in early patch-clamp studies with guard cells. Within the genome era, additional Arabidopsis Shaker-type channels appeared. All nine members of the Arabidopsis Shaker family are localized at the plasma membrane, where they either operate as inward rectifiers, outward rectifiers, weak voltage-dependent channels, or electrically silent, but modulatory subunits. The vacuole membrane, in contrast, harbors a set of two-pore K+ channels. Just very recently, two plant anion channel families of the SLAC/SLAH and ALMT/QUAC type were identified. SLAC1/SLAH3 and QUAC1 are expressed in guard cells and mediate Slow- and Rapid-type anion currents, respectively, that are involved in volume and turgor regulation. Anion channels in guard cells and other plant cells are key targets within often complex signaling networks. Here, the present knowledge is reviewed for the plant ion channel biology. Special emphasis is drawn to the molecular mechanisms of channel regulation, in the context of model systems and in the light of evolution.

Its method and design resemble those of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is a unique medical system that assisted the ancient Chinese in dealing with disease. The technology platforms of systems biology, especially metabolomics, could provide more rapid, direct, concise and effective methods for disease research. In particular, metabolomics could provide useful tools for exploring the essence of Chinese medicine syndromes (CMS) disease, facilitating personalized TCM. Moreover, metabolomics has the potential to enable mapping of early biochemical changes in disease and hence provide an opportunity to develop predictive biomarkers that can trigger earlier interventions. A future hope for the metabonomic approach is the identification of biomarkers that are able to highlight individuals likely to suffer from disease and enable early diagnosis of the disease or the identification of those at risk, and it will help to understand CMS and modernize TCM. In this review, we focus on the key role of robust metabolomic approaches as an aid for traditional herbal medicine; particular attention will be paid to the past successes in applications of metabonomics to contribute to low-molecular-weight metabolites (biomarkers) discovery in TCM research.

Here, we focus on methods to improve protein stability without comprising biological function. We found that the four isoforms of the Arabidopsis RAD23 protein family are relatively stable. The UBA2 domain derived from RAD23a can be used as a portable stabilizing signal to prolong the half-life of two unstable transcription factors (TFs), HFR1 and PIF3. The increased stability of the TFUBA2 fusion proteins results in an enhanced phenotype in transgenic plants compared to expression of the TF alone. Similar results were obtained for the RAD23a UBA1 domain. In addition to UBA1/2 of RAD23a, the UBA domain from the Arabidopsis DDI1 protein also increased the half-life of the unstable protein JAZ10.1, which is involved in jasmonate signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that UBA fusions can be used to increase the stability of unstable proteins for basic plant biology research as well as crop improvement.

Since high-throughput data for protein modifications are inherently incomplete, we developed a strategy to extend and validate such primary datasets. We selected interesting protein candidates from a global screen in yeast and employed a modified histidine biotin tag that allows tandem affinity purifications of our targets under denaturing conditions. Products in question can be digested directly from affinity resins and phosphopeptides can be further enriched via TiO2 before MS analysis. Our robust protocol can be amended for SILAC as well as iTRAQ quantifications or label-free approaches based on selective reaction monitoring, allowing completion of the phosphorylation pattern in a first step, followed by a detailed analysis of the phosphorylation kinetics. We exemplify the value of such a strategy by an in-depth analysis of Pan1, a highly phosphorylated factor involved in early steps of endocytosis.

Membrane proteins are of great interest particularly those with functional domains exposed to the extracellular environment. Integral membrane proteins represent about one-third of the proteins encoded by the human genome and assume a variety of key biological functions, such as cell-to-cell communication, receptor-mediated signal transduction, selective transport, and pharmacological actions. More than two-thirds of membrane proteins are drug targets, highlighting their immensely important pharmaceutical significance. Most plasma membrane proteins and proteins from other cellular membranes have several PTMs; for example, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and nitrosylation, and moreover, PTMs of proteins are known to play a key role in tumor biology. These modifications often cause change in stoichiometry and microheterogeneity in a protein molecule, which is apparent during electrophoretic separation. Furthermore, the analysis of glyco- and phosphoproteome of cell membrane presents a number of challenges mainly due to their low abundance, their large dynamic range, and the inherent hydrophobicity of membrane proteins. Under pathological conditions, PTMs, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are frequently altered and have been recognized as a potential source for disease biomarkers. Thus, their accurate differential expression analysis, along with differential PTM analysis is of paramount importance.

The Canada thistle life cycle, growth, and development are seasonally affected, and exploiting this biology may be useful for weed management. The objective of this study was to evaluate smother crop mixtures, seeded at different times, for Canada thistle control. Field trials were established in 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the ability of smother crop mixtures to suppress Canada thistle growth and development. Canada thistle aboveground biomass was suppressed 50% in 2009 and 87% in 2010 by the sorghum-sudangrass mixture, averaged over planting times. The oat mixture suppressed annual weed biomass more than 58% in 2009 and 67% in 2010 in all planting dates. Percent cover of Canada thistle was affected by crop mixture in 2009 and 2010, with sorghum-sudangrass being the most suppressive. The sorghum-sudangrass mixture was more suppressive of Canada thistle, probably because it included soybean and sunflower, all high-biomass, competitive crops. Planting date affected smother crop suppression of Canada thistle growth, but the effect was not consistent between 2009 and 2010 due to differences in weather conditions.

Although it has been in Prairie Canada for many years, basic biological and spatial data is lacking. In this study we determined growth rates and seed production using season long field data, statistically modelled season long growth, and developed an interpolated growing degree-day (GDD's) risk surface. We found that stems emerged from perennial root stocks in late May to early June after about 45 GDD's. On average, stems reached 50 % of their final height at about 338 GDD's, and final stem heights were reached at about 1007 GDD's. The mean number of seed capsules produced per stem was 276.4 while the mean number of seeds produced by a seed capsule was 79.4. We found that a three parameter logistic function was a robust predictor of growth (R (2) = 0.86). Our interpolated risk surface indicated that GDD's may be a constraining parameter for the distribution of purple loosestrife in Prairie Canada.

In habitats that remain unchanged for many generations, stabilizing selection maximizes exploitation of resources by reducing trait diversity to a narrow optimal range. One might expect that such ostensibly homogeneous populations would have a reduced potential for heritable adaptive responses when faced with fitness-reducing environmental changes. However, field studies have documented populations that, even after long periods of evolutionary stasis, can still rapidly evolve in response to changed environmental conditions. We argue that degeneracy, the ability of diverse population elements to function similarly, can satisfy both the current need to maximize fitness and the future need for diversity. Degenerate ensembles appear functionally redundant in certain environmental contexts and functionally diverse in others. We propose that genetic variation not contributing to the observed range of phenotypes in a current population, also known as cryptic genetic variation (CGV), is a specific case of degeneracy. We argue that CGV, which gradually accumulates in static populations in stable environments, reveals hidden trait differences when environments change. By allowing CGV accumulation, static populations prepare themselves for future rapid adaptations to environmental novelty. A greater appreciation of degeneracy's role in resolving the inherent tension between current stabilizing selection and future directional selection has implications in conservation biology and may be applied in social and technological systems to maximize current performance while strengthening the potential for future changes.

The widest TIL investigation was in post resection prognosis but TIL subtypes, counts and methodology showed variability between studies. Recent reports explored TIL in predicting response to adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments.Conclusion: An increasing body of evidence supports that visibility of colorectal cancer to immune attack is substantial and that it limits disease progression.

These receptors are the target of GnRH agonists (through receptor desensitization) and antagonists (through receptor blockade) for the treatment of steroid-dependent pathologies, including hormone-dependent tumors. It has also become increasingly clear that GnRH-R are expressed in cancer tissues, either related (i.e. prostate, breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers) or unrelated (i.e. melanoma, glioblastoma, lung, and pancreatic cancers) to the reproductive system. In hormone-related tumors, GnRH-R appear to be expressed even when the tumor has escaped steroid dependence (such as castration-resistant prostate cancer). These receptors are coupled to a G(alpha i)-mediated intracellular signaling pathway. Activation of tumor GnRH-R by means of GnRH agonists elicits a strong antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenic (more recently demonstrated) activity. Interestingly, GnRH antagonists have also been shown to elicit a direct antitumor effect; thus, these compounds behave as antagonists of GnRH-R at the pituitary level and as agonists of the same receptors expressed in tumors. According to the ligand-induced selective-signaling theory, GnRH-R might assume various conformations, endowed with different activities for GnRH analogs and with different intracellular signaling pathways, according to the cell context. Based on these consistent experimental observations, tumor GnRH-R are now considered a very interesting candidate for novel molecular, GnRH analog-based, targeted strategies for the treatment of tumors expressing these receptors. These agents include GnRH agonists and antagonists, GnRH analog-based cytotoxic (i.e. doxorubicin) or nutraceutic (i.e. curcumin) hybrids, and GnRH-R-targeted nanoparticles delivering anticancer compounds.

Developmental time in days for immature stages and total development (egg to adult) on both host species were inversely proportional to temperature between 8 and 27 degrees C but increased at 31 degrees C. One linear and two nonlinear models were fitted to the data.

Furthermore, our GNR-array nanolaser device model can be determined as two distinct two-variable reductions of the rate equations in the limit of large capture rates, depending on their relative values. The first case leads to the rate equations for quantum well lasers, exhibiting relaxation oscillations dynamics.

The idea of an evolving universe dates back only to the 19th century, and became a guiding principle for astronomical research only in the second half of the 20th century. The modern synthesis in evolutionary biology hastened the acceptance of the idea in its cosmic setting, as did the confirmation of the Big Bang theory for the origin of the universe. NASA programmes such as Origins incorporated it as a guiding principle. Cosmic evolution encompasses physical, biological and cultural evolution, and may result in a physical, biological or postbiological universe, each with its own implications for long-term human destiny, and each imbuing the meaning of life with different values. It has the status of an increasingly accepted worldview that is beginning to have a profound effect not only in science but also in religion and philosophy.

Both are dependent on decoding those historic phenomena called 'fossils', here taken to include biogenic traces of activity and waste products. There is the shared problem of data restoration from incomplete data sets; the importance of contextual analysis of potentially viable habitats; the centrality of cell theory; the need to reject the null hypothesis of an abiogenic origin for candidate cells via morphospace analysis; the need to demonstrate biology-like behaviour (e.g., association with biofilm-like structures; tendency to form clusters and 'mats'; and a preference for certain substrates), and of metabolism-like behaviour (e.g., within the candidate cell wall; within surrounding 'waste products'; evidence for syntrophy and metabolic cycles; and evidence for metabolic tiers).

In order to investigate the effect of phase disorder on dynamics of the array, we take into account that individual uncoupled Duffing oscillator with a parametric excitation is chaotic no matter what the initial phase of the excitation is. It is shown that phase disorder by randomly choosing the initial phases of excitations can suppress spatio-temporal chaos in the system coupled by chaotic Duffing oscillators. When all the phases are the same and deterministic, the oscillators remain chaotic and asynchronous no matter what the common phase is. When driven asynchronously by introducing phase disorder, the oscillators coupled in the array appear more regular with increase of the amplitude of random phase, and the highest level of synchrony between them is induced by intermediate phase disorder, displaying a resonance like phenomenon caused from the transition of the coupled oscillators from chaos to periodic motion. Since varying the initial phases of excitations is more feasible than altering parameters intrinsic to the oscillators coupled in an array, this study provides a practical method for control and synchronization of chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional, spatially extended systems, which might have potential applications in engineering, neuroscience and biology.

In addition, the identified genetic determinants may be used to enhance current risk factor profiles.Evidence Acquisition: There have been more than 40 published GWAS on skeletal phenotypes, predominantly focused on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine.Evidence Synthesis: Sixty-six BMD loci have been replicated across all the published GWAS, confirming the highly polygenic nature of BMD variation. Only seven of the 66 previously reported genes (LRP5, SOST, ESR1, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF11A, TNFSF11, PTH) from candidate gene association studies have been confirmed by GWAS. Among 59 novel BMD GWAS loci that have not been reported by previous candidate gene association studies, some have been shown to be involved in key biological pathways involving the skeleton, particularly Wnt signaling (AXIN1, LRP5, CTNNB1, DKK1, FOXC2, HOXC6, LRP4, MEF2C, PTHLH, RSPO3, SFRP4, TGFBR3, WLS, WNT3, WNT4, WNT5B, WNT16), bone development: ossification (CLCN7, CSF1, MEF2C, MEPE, PKDCC, PTHLH, RUNX2, SOX6, SOX9, SPP1, SP7), mesenchymal-stem-cell differentiation (FAM3C, MEF2C, RUNX2, SOX4, SOX9, SP7), osteoclast differentiation (JAG1, RUNX2), and TGF-signaling (FOXL1, SPTBN1, TGFBR3). There are still 30 BMD GWAS loci without prior molecular or biological evidence of their involvement in skeletal phenotypes. Other skeletal phenotypes that either have been or are being studied include hip geometry, bone ultrasound, quantitative computed tomography, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, biochemical markers, and fractures such as vertebral, nonvertebral, hip, and forearm.Conclusions: Although several challenges lie ahead as GWAS moves into the next generation, there are prospects of new discoveries in skeletal biology. This review integrates findings from previous GWAS and provides a roadmap for future directions building on current GWAS successes.

In a recent work, we reported that the transcriptional regulator Id1 contributes to thyroid cancer progression by powering the invasion capacity of tumor cells.Objective: The intent of this work was to further investigate the biology of invasive thyroid tumors, through the analysis of the molecular interactions existing between Id1 and some of its target genes and through the characterization of the function of these factors in the progression of thyroid tumors.Results: We showed that Id1 controls the expression of the Runx2 isoform I and that this transcription factor plays a central role in mediating the Id1 proinvasive function in thyroid tumor cells. We demonstrated that Runx2 regulates proliferation, migration, and invasiveness by activating a panel of genes involved in matrix degradation and cellular invasion, which we previously identified as Id1 target genes in thyroid tumor cells. Finally, we show that Runx2 is strongly expressed in metastatic human thyroid tumors both at the primary site and in metastases.Conclusion: Overall, our experiments demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown molecular axis that controls thyroid tumor invasiveness by altering the ability of tumor cells to interact with the surrounding microenvironment. These factors could prove to be valuable markers that permit early diagnosis of aggressive thyroid tumors.

To analyze the tree-structured data, various measures for computing the similarity between them have been developed and applied. Among them, tree edit distance is one of the most widely used measures. However, the tree edit distance problem for unordered trees is NP-hard. Therefore, it is required to develop efficient algorithms for the problem. Recently, a practical method called clique-based algorithm has been proposed, but it is not fast for large trees.This article presents an improved clique-based method for the tree edit distance problem for unordered trees. The improved method is obtained by introducing a dynamic programming scheme and heuristic techniques to the previous clique-based method. To evaluate the efficiency of the improved method, we applied the method to comparison of real tree structured data such as glycan structures. For large tree-structures, the improved method is much faster than the previous method. In particular, for hard instances, the improved method achieved more than 100 times speed-up.

Here we present SLIQ, a set of simple linear inequalities derived from the geometry of contigs on the line that can be used to predict the relative positions and orientations of contigs from individual mate pair reads and thus produce a contig digraph. The SLIQ inequalities can also filter out unreliable mate pairs and can be used as a preprocessing step for any scaffolding algorithm. We tested the SLIQ inequalities on five real data sets ranging in complexity from simple bacterial genomes to complex mammalian genomes and compared the results to the majority voting procedure used by many other scaffolding algorithms. SLIQ predicted the relative positions and orientations of the contigs with high accuracy in all cases and gave more accurate position predictions than majority voting for complex genomes, in particular the human genome. Finally, we present a simple scaffolding algorithm that produces linear scaffolds given a contig digraph. We show that our algorithm is very efficient compared to other scaffolding algorithms while maintaining high accuracy in predicting both contig positions and orientations for real data sets.

It enables very fast detection of clashes and free potential energy calculations. The efficiency of chain trees is closely related to the bounding volumes associated with chain tree nodes. A protein subchain associated with a node of a chain tree will clash with another subchain only if their bounding volumes intersect. It is therefore essential that bounding volumes are as tight as possible while intersection tests can be carried out efficiently. We compare the performance of four different types of bounding volumes in connection with the rotation of protein bonds. It is observed that oriented bounding boxes are not as good as could be expected judging by their extensive use in various applications. Both rectangular-and line-swept spheres are shown to have very good tightness of fit but the line-swept, or even simple spheres, are shown to be significantly faster because of quick overlap checks.

The wheatear, a small songbird, has declined dramatically throughout Europe. It is known to live in alpine meadows, in tundra, and rural landscapes as well as in urban areas, but it is unknown if these urban populations reproduce sufficiently. This study aimed to investigate reproductive success and habitat requirements of the wheatear in the city of Berlin, Germany. We analysed occurrence and breeding success in relation to vegetation and surface structure of the settled sites, intensity of direct disturbance by humans and dogs, as well as degree of sealing and residential population density in the surrounding urban matrix. Finally, we compared early-settled to late-settled territories to appraise habitat preferences of wheatears.The proportion of successful nests was high (73%) compared to other regions and habitats. Area size of a site greatly affected the probability of wheatear occurrence; it was much higher on sites larger than five hectare. Factors affecting breeding success differed completely from those explaining variation in occurrence, indicating that breeding success seems not to be related to habitat preferences. There was no influence of the urban matrix at a landscape level (200 m and 2000 m zone) on occurrence or breeding success. To maintain and create habitat for endangered open-land species as the wheatear, we recommend minimum area size of five hectare, sparse vegetation, open soils, short grass, and very few trees and shrubs.

Chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) are important in this resource portfolio because of their demonstrated use for gene discovery, genetic and epigenetic studies, functional characterizations, and systems analysis. CSSs are made by replacing a single chromosome in a host strain with the corresponding chromosome from a donor strain. A complete CSS panel involves a total of 22 engineered inbred strains, one for each of the 19 autosomes, one each for the X and Y chromosomes, and one for mitochondria. A genome survey simply involves comparing each phenotype for each of the CSSs with the phenotypes of the host strain. The CSS panels that are available for laboratory mice have been used to dissect a remarkable variety of phenotypes and to characterize an impressive array of disease models. These surveys have revealed considerable phenotypic diversity even among closely related progenitor strains, evidence for strong epistasis and for heritable epigenetic changes. Perhaps most importantly, and presumably because of their unique genetic constitution, CSSs, and congenic strains derived from them, the genetic variants underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are readily identified and functionally characterized. Together these studies show that CSSs are important resource for laboratory mice.

To understand the mammalian system's response to nickel exposure, we analysed the NiCl2 induced metabolomic changes in urine of rats using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy together with clinically relevant biochemical parameters. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered intraperitoneally with NiCl2 at doses of 4, 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight. Urine samples were collected at 8, 16, 24, 72, 96 and 120 h post treatment. The metabolomic profile of rat urine showed prominent changes in citrate, dimethylamine, creatinine, choline, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), phenyl alanine and hippurate at all doses. Principal component analysis of urine H-1 NMR spectra demonstrated the dose and time dependent development of toxicity. The metabolomic time trajectory, based on pattern recognition analysis of H-1 NMR spectra of urine, illustrated clear separation of pre and post treatments (temporal). Only animals treated with a low dose of NiCl2 returned to normal physiology. The H-1 NMR spectral data correlated well with the clinically relevant nephrotoxic biomarkers. The urinary metabolomic phenotyping for NiCl2 induced nephrotoxicity was defined according to the predictive ability of the known metabolite biomarkers, creatinine, citrate and TMAO.

The evolution of higher eukaryotic cells endowed them with a large genetic investment in the molecular machinery that ensures chromosome stability. In mammalian and other vertebrate cells, the elimination of double-strand breaks with minimal nucleotide sequence change involves the spatiotemporal orchestration of a seemingly endless number of proteins ranging in their action from the nucleotide level to nucleosome organization and chromosome architecture. DNA DSBs trigger a myriad of post-translational modifications that alter catalytic activities and the specificity of protein interactions: phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, and SUMOylation, followed by the reversal of these changes as repair is completed. ""Superfluous"" protein recruitment to damage sites, functional redundancy, and alternative pathways ensure that DSB repair is extremely efficient, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This review strives to integrate the information about the molecular mechanisms of DSB repair that has emerged over the last two decades with a focus on DSBs produced by the prototype agent ionizing radiation (IR). The exponential growth of molecular studies, heavily driven by RNA knockdown technology, now reveals an outline of how many key protein players in genome stability and cancer biology perform their interwoven tasks, e.g. ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1, Chk2, PARP1/2/3, 53BP1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BLM, RAD51, and the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex.

However, the magnitude of health risks at low doses and dose-rates (below 100 mSv and/or 0.1 mSv min(-1)) remains controversial due to a lack of direct human evidence. It is anticipated that significant insights will emerge from the integration of epidemiological and biological research, made possible by molecular epidemiology studies incorporating biomarkers and bioassays. A number of these have been used to investigate exposure, effects and susceptibility to ionizing radiation, albeit often at higher doses and dose rates, with each reflecting time-limited cellular or physiological alterations. This review summarises the multidisciplinary work undertaken in the framework of the European project DoReMi (Low Dose Research towards Multidisciplinary Integration) to identify the most appropriate biomarkers for use in population studies. In addition to logistical and ethical considerations for conducting large-scale epidemiological studies, we discuss the relevance of their use for assessing the effects of low dose ionizing radiation exposure at the cellular and physiological level. We also propose a temporal classification of biomarkers that may be relevant for molecular epidemiology studies which need to take into account the time elapsed since exposure. Finally, the integration of biology with epidemiology requires careful planning and enhanced discussions between the epidemiology, biology and dosimetry communities in order to determine the most important questions to be addressed in light of pragmatic considerations including the appropriate population to be investigated (occupationally, environmentally or medically exposed), and study design.

We conducted an experimental translocation of Tuamotu kingfishers (Todiramphus gambieri gertrudae) to provide foundational information about movement ecology and inform conservation planning for the critically endangered bird. We captured and radio-marked mated pairs of kingfishers on Niau Atoll, French Polynesia, where approximately 125 individuals compose the last remaining population of Tuamotu kingfishers. One bird from each pair was translocated to a reintroduction site on the opposite side of the island, and the other pair member was released back onto the home territory. Home-ranging pair members remained on territories and used habitats disproportional to availability, as determined by Brownian bridge analysis. Translocated individuals made multiple forays from the release site to explore the surrounding landscape, during which habitats were used in proportions similar to availability. The exploratory behavior resembled that of dispersing juvenile birds, which suggested that adults retain the ability to explore, and that dispersal theory may be a useful basis for planning translocations. Vacancies on donor territories were filled within 1-10 days. Our results indicated that translocation was not effective for range expansion on Niau because birds readily returned to donor areas; however, translocation to other islands remains a potential conservation strategy for Tuamotu kingfishers.

Excessive and insufficient angiogenesis have been associated with many diseases including cancer, age-related macular degeneration, ischemic heart, brain, and skeletal muscle diseases. A comprehensive understanding of angiogenesis regulatory processes is needed to improve treatment of these diseases. To identify proteins related to angiogenesis, we developed a novel integrative framework for diverse sources of high-throughput data. The system, called GeneHits, was used to expand on known angiogenesis pathways to construct the angiome, a protein-protein interaction network for angiogenesis. The network consists of 478 proteins and 1,488 interactions. The network was validated through cross validation and analysis of five gene expression datasets from in vitro angiogenesis assays. We calculated the topological properties of the angiome. We analyzed the functional enrichment of angiogenesis-annotated and associated proteins. We also constructed an extended angiome with 1,233 proteins and 5,726 interactions to derive a more complete map of protein-protein interactions in angiogenesis. Finally, the extended angiome was used to identify growth factor signaling networks that drive angiogenesis and antiangiogenic signaling networks.

DGAT activity resides mainly in two distinct membrane bound polypeptides, known as DGAT1 and DGAT2 which have been identified in numerous organisms. In addition, a few other enzymes also hold DGAT activity, including the DGAT-related acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferases (MGAT). Progress on understanding structure/function in DGATs has been limited by the lack of detailed three-dimensional structural information due to the hydrophobic properties of theses enzymes and difficulties associated with purification. This review examines several aspects of DGAT and MGAT genes and enzymes, including current knowledge on their gene structure, expression pattern, biochemical properties, membrane topology, functional motifs and subcellular localization. Recent progress in probing structural and functional aspects of DGAT1 and DGAT2, using a combination of molecular and biochemical techniques, is emphasized. Biotechnological applications involving DGAT enzymes ranging from obesity therapeutics to oilseed engineering are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, its relevance in tumor biology and the metastatic process still faces some controversy. Clarification may arise when considering the EMT as a reversible and often incomplete process, essentially a manifestation of strong epithelial plasticity. Transient cellular states are generated to fulfill specific requirements in each and all the steps of the metastatic process, from primary tumor cell detachment to dissemination and colonization. Opposing multiple cellular programs that promote or prevent EMT, thereby destabilizing or reinforcing epithelial integrity, play a central role in the inherent cellular dynamics of cancer progression. These cell biology programs not only drive cells towards the epithelial or the mesenchymal state but also impinge into multiple cellular and global responses including proliferation, sternness, chemo and immunotherapy resistance, inflammation and immunity, all relevant for the development of the metastatic disease.

Here, we present stochastic and deterministic models describing tumour growth based on the cancer stem cell hypothesis, and discuss the application of these models to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In particular, we discuss how such quantitative approaches can be used to validate different possible scenarios that can lead to an increase in stem cell activity following induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, observed in recent experimental studies on human breast cancer and related cell lines.

When viewed from this perspective, the biology of a tumor can be understood only by studying tumor cell heterogeneity and the microenvironment that is constructed during the course of tumorigenesis and malignant progression. Recent work has revealed the existence of cancer stem cells, the ""bugs"", with the capacity for self-renewal and tumor propagation. In addition, it is now recognized that the tumor microenvironment, the ""bed"", plays a critical role in supporting cancer stem cells and also may promote neoplasia and malignant progression. The interdependence of the cell-intrinsic features of cancer, including the cancer stem cell ""bugs"" and the tumor microenvironment ""bed"", is only beginning to be understood. In this review, we highlight the rapidly evolving concepts about the interactions between tumor stem cells and their microenvironment, the insights gained from studying their normal tissue counterparts, and the questions and controversies surrounding this area of research, with an emphasis on breast and lung cancer. Finally, we address evidence supporting the notion that eliminating the bed as well as the bugs should lead to more effective and personalized cancer treatments that improve patient outcome.

The term, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the changes in molecular biology and cellular physiology that allow a cell to transition from a sedentary cell to a motile cell, a process that is relevant not only for cancer and regeneration, but also for normal development of multicellular organisms. The present review compares the similarities and differences in cellular response at the molecular level as tumor cells enter EMT or as keratinocytes begin the process of re-epithelialization of a wound. Looking toward clinical interventions that might modulate these processes, the mechanisms and outcomes of current and potential therapies are reviewed for both anti-cancer and pro-wound healing treatments related to the pathways that are central to EMT. Taken together, the comparison of re-epithelialization and tumor EMT serves as a starting point for the development of therapies that can selectively modulate different forms of EMT.

To study the influence of vCCI on virus biology, a virus with the vCCI gene coding for a prolonged signal sequence was prepared. We found that secreted vCCI attenuated the virus in vivo, and that it correlated with decreased levels of RANTES, eotaxin, TARC, and MDC in the blood in comparison with the parental virus. We determined the influence of vCCI on the CTL response against VACV E3((140-148)) (VGPSNSPTF) and HPV16 E7((49-57)) (RAHYNIVTF) H-2D(b)-restricted epitopes. The examination of the specific CTL response elicited by immunization with the recombinant VACV-expressing tumor-associated HPV16 E7 antigen by IFN-gamma ELISPOT showed that the immunogenicity of the recombinant VACV-producing secretory vCCI was similar to that of the parent virus or deletion mutant in the C23L/B29R locus. Immunization with the secretory vCCI-producing recombinant virus has a lower therapeutic anti-tumor effect against TC-1 tumors. Viral CCI downregulated the E7-specific response induced by gene gun immunization with the DNA vaccines pBSC-SigE7 LAMP and pBSC-vCCI.

The eastern Usangu wetlands that were previously perennial dried out in 2000 and 2002 in the dry season. Following the removal of cattle in 2006 from the eastern Usangu wetlands, perennial wetlands has re-established itself and in 2011 the vegetation had recovered and covered about 95 % of the wetted surface mainly as floating vegetation. These wetlands are the source of water of the Great Ruaha River and the volume of water entering the river has nearly doubled after cattle removal. We suggest that this may be due to the shading effect of the floating vegetation reducing the loss of water through net evaporation to about 0.5 cm day(-1) as opposed to about 1 cm day(-1) for open water evaporation in this tropical climate. This suggests the important role of the biology in controlling the water budget. By contrast cattle and rice farms have not been removed from the western Usangu wetlands, located upstream, where the wetlands are now reduced to small areas fringing the rivers. We suggest that the western Usangu wetlands should also be restored in order to further increase flows in the Great Ruaha River. At the same time water governance in the catchments and irrigation areas upstream of Usangu wetlands is also urgently required because present water yields are insufficient to meet the hydroelectric needs of Tanzania, the water users all along the river, as well as the important coastal wetlands associated with the Rufiji Delta during a drought year.

This process, called dedifferentiation, is likely to be important for replacing stem cells as they age or get damaged. Tremendous progress has been made in understanding this fundamental process, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the aberrant activation of Ras-ERK MAPK signaling promotes cellular dedifferentiation in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. To activate signaling, we removed two negative regulators, the PUF-8 RNA-binding protein and LIP-1 dual specificity phosphatase. The removal of both of these two regulators caused secondary spermatocytes to dedifferentiate and begin mitotic divisions. Interestingly, reduction of Ras-ERK MAPK signaling, either by mutation or chemical inhibition, blocked the initiation of dedifferentiation. By RNAi screening, we identified RSKN-1/P90(RSK) as a downstream effector of MPK-1/ERK that is critical for dedifferentiation: rskn-1 RNAi suppressed spermatocyte dedifferentiation and instead induced meiotic divisions. These regulators are broadly conserved, suggesting that similar molecular circuitry may control cellular dedifferentiation in other organisms, including humans. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TALE specificity correlates with repeat variable diresidues in otherwise highly stereotypical 34-35mer repeats. Recently, the crystal structures of two TALE DNA-binding domains have illustrated the molecular basis of the TALE cipher. The structures show that the TALE repeats form a right-handed superhelix that is wound around largely undistorted B-DNA to match its helical parameters. Surprisingly, repeat variable residue 1 is not in contact with the bases. Instead, it is involved in hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the overall structure of the protein. Repeat variable residue 2 contacts the top strand base and forms sequence-specific hydrogen bonds and/or van der Waals contacts. Very unexpectedly, bottom strand bases are exposed to solvent and do not make any direct contacts with the protein. This review contains a summary of TALE biology and applications and a detailed description of the recent breakthroughs that have provided insights into the molecular basis of the TALE code.

However, only two families of SUMO isopeptidases are at present known. Here, we report an activity-based search with the suicide inhibitor haemagglutinin (HA)-SUMO-vinylmethylester that led to the identification of a surprising new SUMO protease, ubiquitin-specific protease-like 1 (USPL1). Indeed, USPL1 neither binds nor cleaves ubiquitin, but is a potent SUMO isopeptidase both in vitro and in cells. C13orf22l-an essential but distant zebrafish homologue of USPL1-also acts on SUMO, indicating functional conservation. We have identified invariant USPL1 residues required for SUMO binding and cleavage. USPL1 is a low-abundance protein that colocalizes with coilin in Cajal bodies. Its depletion does not affect global sumoylation, but causes striking coilin mislocalization and impairs cell proliferation, functions that are not dependent on USPL1 catalytic activity. Thus, USPL1 represents a third type of SUMO protease, with essential functions in Cajal body biology.

This approach has been made possible through advances in both molecular biology and automation. The utility of this approach has been further enhanced through the application of image-based high-content screening: an automated microscopy and quantitative image analysis platform. These approaches can significantly enhance the acquisition of novel targets for drug discovery.Areas covered: Both the utility and potential issues associated with functional genomic screening approaches are discussed in this review, along with examples that illustrate both. The considerations for high-content screening applied to functional genomics are also presented.Expert opinion: Functional genomic screening and high-content screening are extremely useful in the identification of newdrug targets. However, the technical, experimental, and computational parameters have an enormous influence on the results. Thus, although new targets are identified, caution should be applied to the interpretation of screening data in isolation. Genomic screens should be viewed as an integral component of a target identification campaign that requires both the acquisition of orthogonal data, as well as a rigorous validation strategy.

However, to what extent is knowledge about an individual's genotype, together with information about the environment that they have experienced, sufficient to predict phenotypic variation? In the present review, we argue that, although the typical phenotypic outcome of an individual's genome can be predicted, it is much more difficult to predict the actual outcome for a particular individual. We highlight three reasons for this. First, the outcome of mutations can be influenced by random (stochastic) processes. Second, genetic variation present in one generation can influence phenotypic traits in the next generation, even if individuals do not inherit this variation. Third, the environment experienced by one generation can influence phenotypic variation in the next generation. These contributions to phenotypic variation have long been appreciated by quantitative geneticists, although they have only recently been studied at the molecular level. Taken together, they mean that, in many cases, the genotypes of individuals and the environment that they experience may not be sufficient to determine their phenotypes. A more comprehensive genotype-to-phenotype model will be required to make accurate predictions about the biology of individuals.

DHLs are characterized by poor outcome. We tested whether DLBCLs with high expression of MYC protein and BCL2 protein share the clinical features and poor prognosis of DHLs.Patients and MethodsParaffin-embedded lymphoma samples from 193 patients with de novo DLBCL who were uniformly treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) were studied using immunohistochemistry for MYC, BCL2, CD10, BCL6, and MUM1/interferon regulatory factor 4, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for MYC and BCL2.ResultsFISH analysis identified DHL in 6% of patients, who showed the expected poor overall survival (OS; P = .002). On the basis of immunohistochemical MYC and BCL2 expression, a double-hit score (DHS) was assigned to all patients with DLBCL. The DHS-2 group, defined by high expression of both MYC and BCL2 protein, comprised 29% of the patients. DHS 2 was significantly associated with lower complete response rate (P = .004), shorter OS (P < .001), and shorter progression-free survival (PFS; P < .001). The highly significant correlation with OS and PFS was maintained in multivariate models that controlled for the International Prognostic Index and the cell-of-origin subtype (OS, P < .001; PFS, P < .001). DHS was validated in an independent cohort of 116 patients who were treated with R-CHOP.ConclusionThe immunohistochemical DHS defined a large subset of DLBCLs with double-hit biology and was strongly associated with poor outcome in patients treated with R-CHOP.

Survival of anoxia is associated with entry into a state of metabolic dormancy known as diapause. However, extreme tolerance of anoxia is retained for several days of post-diapause development. Rates of heat dissipation in diapause II and 4 days post-diapause II embryos were measured under aerobic conditions and during the transition into anoxia. Phosphorylated adenylate compounds were quantified in embryos during entry into anoxia and after 12?hr of aerobic recovery. Rates of heat dissipation were not affected by exposure to anoxia in diapause II embryos, while post-diapause II embryos experienced a profound decrease in heat dissipation. ATP decreased substantially in both developmental stages upon exposure to anoxia, and all indicators of cellular energetic status indicated energetic stress, at least based on the mammalian paradigm. The rate of decline in ATP is the most acute reported for any vertebrate. The mechanisms responsible for cellular survival despite a clear dysregulation between energy production and energy consumption remain to be identified. Necrotic and apoptotic cell death in response to hypoxia contribute to poor survival during many diseases and pathological conditions in mammals. Understanding the mechanisms that are in place to prevent maladaptive cell death in embryos of A. limnaeus may greatly improve treatment strategies in diseases that involve hypoxia and reperfusion injuries.

This observation is consistent with a cellular phenotype in which the cell death program has been initiated but cannot be executed. Our aim was to determine whether ballooned hepatocytes have potentially disabled the cell death execution machinery, and if so, can their functional biology be modeled in vitro.Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed on human NASH specimens. In vitro studies were performed using HuH-7 cells with shRNA targeted knockdown of caspase 9 (shC9 cells) or primary hepatocytes from caspase 3(-/-) mice.Results: Ballooned hepatocytes in NASH display diminished expression of caspase 9. This phenotype was modeled using shC9 cells: these cells were resistant to lipoapoptosis by palmitate (PA) or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) despite lipid droplet formation. During lipid loading by either PA or LPC, shC9 cells activate JNK which induces SHH expression via AP-1. An autocrine hedgehog survival signaling pathway was further delineated in both shC9 and caspase 3(-/-) cells during lipotoxic stress.Conclusions: Ballooned hepatocytes in NASH downregulate caspase 9, a pivotal caspase executing the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Hepatocytes engineered to reduce caspase 9 expression are resistant to lipoapoptosis, in part, due to a hedgehog autocrine survival signaling pathway.

Despite its importance as vector, almost nothing related to the larval biology, especially about its digestive system has been published. The objective of the present study was to obtain an overview of carbohydrate digestion by the larvae. Taking in account that phlebotomine larvae live in the soil rich in decaying materials and microorganisms we searched principally for enzymes capable to hydrolyze carbohydrates present in this kind of substrate. The principal carbohydrases encountered in the midgut were partially characterized. One of them is a alpha-amylase present in the anterior midgut. It is probably involved with the digestion of glycogen, the reserve carbohydrate of fungi. Two other especially active enzymes were present in the posterior midgut, a membrane bound alpha-glucosidase and a membrane bound trehalase. The first, complete the digestion of glycogen and the other probably acts in the digestion of trehalose, a carbohydrate usually encountered in microorganisms undergoing hydric stress. In a screening done with the use of p-nitrophenyl-derived substrates other less active enzymes were also observed in the midgut. A general view of carbohydrate digestion in L. longipalpis was presented. Our results indicate that soil microorganisms appear to be the main source of nutrients for the larvae.

Still, the substantiation of nutritional health benefits is challenged by the intrinsic macro- and micronutrient complexity of foods and individual responses. Evidence of healthy effects of food requires new strategies not only to stratify populations according to their metabolic requirements but also to predict and measure individual responses to dietary intakes. The influence of the gut microbiome and its interaction with the host is pivotal to understand nutrition and metabolism. Thus, the modulation of the gut microbiome composition by alteration of food habits has potentialities in health improvement or even disease prevention. Dietary polyphenols are naturally occurring constituents in vegetables and fruits, including coffee and cocoa. They are commonly associated to health benefits, although mechanistic evidence in vivo is not yet fully understood.

A hallmark of postpartum biology that may contribute to this poor prognosis is mammary gland involution, involving massive epithelial cell death and dramatic stromal remodeling. Previous studies show pro-tumorigenic properties of extracellular matrix (ECM) isolated from rodent mammary glands undergoing postpartum involution. More recent work demonstrates systemic ibuprofen treatment during involution decreases its tumor-promotional nature. Utilizing a proteomics approach, we identified relative differences in the composition of mammary ECM isolated from nulliparous rats and those undergoing postpartum involution, with and without ibuprofen treatment. GeLC-MS/MS experiments resulted in 20327 peptide identifications that mapped to 884 proteins with a <0.02% false discovery rate. Label-free quantification yielded several ECM differences between nulliparous and involuting glands related to collagen-fiber organization, cell motility and attachment, and cytokine regulation. Increases in known pro-tumorigenic ECM proteins osteopontin, tenascin-C, and laminin-alpha 1 and pro-inflammatory proteins STAT3 and CD68 further identify candidate mediators of breast cancer progression specific to the involution window.

These currently include the Beta Cell Biology Consortium, the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas, the Diabetic Complications Consortium, and the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Centers. Recognizing the synergy that would accrue from aggregating information generated and curated by these initiatives in a contiguous informatics network, we created the NIDDK Consortium Interconnectivity Network (dkCOIN; www.dkcoin.org). The goal of this pilot project, organized by the NIDDK, was to establish a single point of access to a toolkit of interconnected resources (datasets, reagents, and protocols) generated from individual consortia that could be readily accessed by biologists of diverse backgrounds and research interests. During the pilot phase of this activity dkCOIN collected nearly 2000 consortium-curated resources, including datasets (functional genomics) and reagents (mouse strains, antibodies, and adenoviral constructs) and built nearly 3000 resource-to-resource connections, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of further extending this database in the future. Thus, dkCOIN promises to be a useful informatics solution for rapidly identifying useful resources generated by participating research consortia.

We consider asthma, a complex disease characterized by intricate molecular mechanisms, for our study. We aim to integrate prediction of potent drug targets using graph-theoretical methods and subsequent identification of small molecules capable of modulating activity of the best target. In this work, we construct the protein interactome underlying this disease: Asthma Protein Interactome (API). Using a strategy based on network analysis of the interactome, we identify a set of potential drug targets for asthma. Topologically and dynamically, v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (SRC) emerges as the most central target in API. SRC is known to play an important role in promoting airway smooth muscle cell growth and facilitating migration in airway remodeling. From interactome analysis, and with the reported role in respiratory mechanisms, SRC emerges as a promising drug target for asthma. Further, we proceed to identify leads for SRC from a public database of small molecules. We predict two potential leads for SRC using ligand-based virtual screening methodology.

Although these channels have been investigated for several decades, it is still challenging 1) to identify the important nAChR subunits in cholinergic transmission and nicotine dependence and 2) to develop nAChR subtype-specific ligands. To overcome these challenges, we and others have studied mice expressing mutant, gain-of-function nAChR subunits. In this review, we discuss this research approach and the results it has yielded to date. Gain-of-function mutations, including those in nAChR subunits, provide an approach that is complementary to loss-of-function studies such as gene knockouts; the former allows one to answer questions of sufficiency and the latter addresses questions of necessity. Mutant mice expressing gain-of-function nAChR subunits are commonly produced using traditional gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, but novel approaches such as bacterial artificial chromosome transgenesis have yielded important insights as well. alpha 7 nAChRs were the first nAChRs to be targeted with a gain-of-function mutation, followed by a pair of alpha 4 nAChR gain-of-function mutant mice. These alpha 4 nAChR gain-of-function mice (alpha 4 L9'S mice, followed by alpha 4 L9'A mice) provided an important system to probe alpha 4 nAChR function in vivo, particularly in the dopamine reward system. alpha 6 nAChR gain-of-function mice provided the first robust system allowing specific manipulation of this receptor subtype. Other targeted mutations in various nAChR subunits have also been produced and have yielded important insights into nicotinic cholinergic biology. As nAChR research advances and more details associated with nAChR expression and function emerge, we expect that existing and new mouse lines expressing gain-of-function nAChR subunits will continue to provide new insights.

Recent progress in understanding the biology and mechanism of induction revealed a critical role of induction in cellular defense against electrophilic and oxidative stress. Induction is mediated through a novel signaling pathway via two regulatory proteins, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Nrf2 binds to Keap1 at a two site-binding interface and is ubiquitinated by the Keap1/cullin 3/ring box protein-1-ubiquitin ligase, resulting in a rapid turnover of Nrf2 protein. Electrophiles and oxidants modify critical cysteine thiols of Keap1 and Nrf2 to inhibit Nrf2 ubiquitination, leading to Nrf2 activation and induction. Induction increases stress resistance critical for cell survival, because knockout of Nrf2 in mice increased susceptibility to a variety of toxicity and disease processes. Collateral to diverse functions of Nrf2, genome-wide search has led to the identification of a plethora of ARE-dependent genes regulated by Nrf2 in an inducer-, tissue-, and disease-dependent manner to control drug metabolism, antioxidant defense, stress response, proteasomal degradation, and cell proliferation. The protective nature of Nrf2 could also be hijacked in a number of pathological conditions by means of somatic mutation, epigenetic alteration, and accumulation of disruptor proteins, promoting drug resistance in cancer and pathologic liver features in autophagy deficiency. The repertoire of ARE inducers has expanded enormously; the therapeutic potential of the inducers has been examined beyond cancer prevention. Developing potent and specific ARE inducers and Nrf2 inhibitors holds certain new promise for the prevention and therapy against cancer, chronic disease, and toxicity.

Stringent curation and processing of the data from three independent replicates identified 1,932 proteins among which 1,529 were quantified by spectral counting. The quantification procedures have been subsequently validated by immunoblot analysis of six proteins representative of distinct metabolic or regulatory pathways. Among the main features of the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition revealed by the study, chromoplastogenesis appears to be associated with major metabolic shifts: (1) strong decrease in abundance of proteins of light reactions (photosynthesis, Calvin cycle, photorespiration) and carbohydrate metabolism (starch synthesis/degradation), mostly between breaker and red stages and (2) increase in terpenoid biosynthesis (including carotenoids) and stress-response proteins (ascorbate-glutathione cycle, abiotic stress, redox, heat shock). These metabolic shifts are preceded by the accumulation of plastid-encoded acetyl Coenzyme A carboxylase D proteins accounting for the generation of a storage matrix that will accumulate carotenoids. Of particular note is the high abundance of proteins involved in providing energy and in metabolites import. Structural differentiation of the chromoplast is characterized by a sharp and continuous decrease of thylakoid proteins whereas envelope and stroma proteins remain remarkably stable. This is coincident with the disruption of the machinery for thylakoids and photosystem biogenesis (vesicular trafficking, provision of material for thylakoid biosynthesis, photosystems assembly) and the loss of the plastid division machinery. Altogether, the data provide new insights on the chromoplast differentiation process while enriching our knowledge of the plant plastid proteome.

To assess the mechanism of embolism repair, it is crucial to determine if plants can up-regulate the efflux of osmotically active substances into embolized vessels and identify the major components of the released osmoticum. Here, we introduce a new approach of sap collection designed to separate water from nonembolized (functional) and embolized (nonfunctional) vessels. This new approach made possible the chemical analysis of liquid collected from both types of vessels in plants subjected to different levels of water stress. The technique also allowed us to determine the water volumes in nonfunctional vessels as a function of stress level. Overall, with the increase of water stress in plants, the osmotic potential of liquid collected from nonfunctional vessels increased while its volume decreased. These results revealed the presence of both sugars and ions in nonfunctional vessels at elevated levels in comparison with liquid collected from functional vessels, in which only traces of sugars were found. The increased sugar concentration was accompanied by decreased xylem sap pH. These results provide new insight into the biology of refilling, underlining the role of sugar and sugar transporters, and imply that a large degree of hydraulic compartmentalization must exist in the xylem during the refilling process.

Plants contain on average approximately 1 g S kg(-1) dry weight (for comparison plants contain approximately 15 g N kg(-1) dry weight). Sulfur is a constituent of many organic molecules, for example amino acids such as cysteine and methionine and the small tripeptide glutathione, but sulfur is also essential in the form of Fe-S clusters for the activity of many enzymes, particularly those involved in redox reactions. Sulfur chemistry is therefore important. In particular, sulfur in the form of thiol groups is central to manifold aspects of metabolism. Because thiol groups are oxidized and reduced easily and reversibly, the redox control of cellular metabolism has become an increasing focus of research. In the same way that oxygen and nitrogen have reactive species (ROS and RNS), sulfur too can form reactive molecular species (RSS), for example when a -SH group is oxidized. Indeed, several redox reactions occur via RSS intermediates. Several naturally occurring S-containing molecules are themselves RSS and because they are physiologically active they make up part of the intrinsic plant defence repertoire against herbivore and pathogen attack. Furthermore, RSS can also be used as redox-active pharmacological tools to study cell metabolism.The aim of this review is to familiarize the general reader with some of the chemical concepts, terminology and biology of selected RSS.

Our results compare to the observations made in several laboratory experiments as well as the results of differential equation models.

A large set, over 600 homologous and nearly 2,000 heterologous fungal genes, were overexpressed in Aspergillus niger using a standardized expression cassette and scored for high versus no production. Subsequently, sequence-based machine learning techniques were applied for identifying relevant DNA and protein sequence features. The amino-acid composition of the protein sequence was found to be most predictive and interpretation revealed that, for both homologous and heterologous gene expression, the same features are important: tyrosine and asparagine composition was found to have a positive correlation with high-level production, whereas for unsuccessful production, contributions were found for methionine and lysine composition.

Their success invigorates research on multi-specific antibodies in order to enhance drug efficacy by co-targeting of receptors and addressing key questions of emerging resistance mechanisms. Despite challenges in production, multi-specific antibodies are potentially more potent biologics for cancer therapy. However, so far only bispecific antibody formats have entered clinical phase testing. For future design of antibodies allowing even more targeting specificities, an understanding of the antigen-binding properties of such molecules is crucial. To this end, we have generated different IgG-like TriMAbs (trispecific, trivalent and tetravalent antibodies) directed against prominent cell surface antigens often deregulated in tumor biology. A combination of surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques enables quantitative assessment of the antigen-binding properties of TriMAbs. We demonstrate that the kinetic profiles for the individual antigens are similar to the parental antibodies and all antigens can be bound simultaneously even in the presence of FcRIIIa. Furthermore, cooperative binding of TriMAbs to their antigens was demonstrated. All antibodies are fully functional and inhibit receptor phosphorylation and cellular growth. TriMAbs are therefore ideal candidates for future applications in various therapeutic areas.

Faithful synthesis of long cDNA on highly structured RNA templates requires thermostable and processive reverse transcriptases. In a recent attempt to increase the thermostability of the wt Moloney Murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MuLV RT), we have employed the compartmentalized ribosome display (CRD) evolution in vitro technique and identified a large set of previously unknown mutations that enabled cDNA synthesis at elevated temperatures. In this study, we have characterized a group of the M-MuLV RT variants (28 novel amino acid positions, 84 point mutants) carrying the individual mutations. The performance of point mutants (thermal inactivation rate, substrate-binding affinity and processivity) correlated remarkably well with the mutation selection frequency in the CRD experiment. By combining the best-performing mutations D200N, L603W, T330P, L139P and E607K, we have generated highly processive and thermostable multiply-mutated M-MuLV RT variants. The processivity of the best-performing multiple mutant increased to 1500 nt (65-fold improvement in comparison to the wt enzyme), and the maximum temperature of the full-length 7.5-kb cDNA synthesis was raised to 62C (17 higher in comparison with the wt enzyme).

Maximizing the desired ligation product is especially important in DNA library construction for directed evolution experiments since library diversity is directly affected by ligation efficiency. Here, we suggest that display vectors that rely on Type IIP restriction sites for cloning should be redesigned to utilize Type IIS restriction sites instead because ligation yield is significantly improved: we observed up to 15- and 2.6-fold increases in desired products for circular and linear ligation reactions, respectively. To guide ligation optimization more rationally, we developed an easily parameterized thermodynamic model that predicts product distributions based on input DNA concentrations and free energies of the ligation events. We applied this model to study ligation reactions using a ribosome display vector redesigned with Type IIS restriction sites (pRDV2). We computationally predicted and experimentally validated the relative abundance of various products in three-piece linear ligations as well as the extent of transformation from vectorinsert circular ligations.

The recent discovery of Aire expression in stem cells and early embryonic cells and its function in the self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells highlight the importance of Aire in these cells. In this study, we present evidence that Aire promotes the expression of the pluripotent factor Lin28 and the self-renewal of ES cells. We presented the first evidence that the let-7 microRNA family contributed to the self-renewal promoting effect of Aire on ES cells. Moreover, we showed that Aire and Lin28 are co-expressed in the genital ridge, oocytes, and cleavage-stage embryos, and the expression level of Lin28 is correlated with the expression level of Aire. Although it is widely considered to be a promiscuous gene expression activator, these results indicated that Aire promotes the self-renewal of ES cells through a specific pathway (i.e., the activation of Lin28 and the inhibition of the let-7 microRNA family). The correlation between Aire and Lin28 expression in germ cells and early embryos indicated an in vivo function for Aire in toti- and pluripotent stem cells. This study presents the first molecular pathway that incorporates Aire into the pluripotency network. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that microRNAs contribute to the regulatory function of Aire and highlights a novel function of Aire in stem cell biology and reproduction. These functions reveal novel perspectives for studying the molecular mechanisms behind the establishment and sustenance of pluripotent identity.

In this work, we modified a technique combining mussel-inspired surface chemistry and microcontact printing (mu CP) to modulate surface chemistry for cell patterning. Polymerized dopamine on poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamps was transferred to several cell-unfavorable substrates via mu CP. Since cells only attached to the polydopamine (PDA)-imprinted areas, cell patterns were formed on a variety of cell-unfavorable surfaces. The stability of PDA imprints was proved under several harsh conditions. The cell affinity of PDA was modulated by co-deposition with several poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)-based copolymers, such as PEI, PEI-g-PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)) and PEI-g-galactose. The imprints of PDA/PEI-g-PEG provide the formation of cell patterns on cell-favorable substrates. Neuronal PC12 cells were patterned via imprinting of PDA/PEI, while HepG2/C3A cells were arranged on the imprint of PDA/PEI-g-galactose. Finally, co-culture of HepG2/C3A cells and L929 fibroblasts was accomplished by our micropatterning approach. This study demonstrated this simple and economic technique provides a powerful tool for development of functional patterned substrates for cell patterning.

First published August 1, 2012; doi: 10.1152/ajplung.00170.2012.-Pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), composed of clusters of amine [serotonin (5-HT)] and peptide-producing cells, are widely distributed within the airway mucosa of human and animal lungs. NEBs are thought to function as airway O-2-sensors, since they are extensively innervated and release 5-HT upon hypoxia exposure. The small cell lung carcinoma cell line (H146) provides a useful model for native NEBs, since they contain (and secrete) 5-HT and share the expression of a membrane-delimited O-2 sensor [classical NADPH oxidase (NOX2) coupled to an O-2-sensitive K+ channel]. In addition, both native NEBs and H146 cells express different NADPH oxidase homologs (NOX1, NOX4) and its subunits together with a variety of O-2-sensitive voltage-dependent K+ channel proteins (K-v) and tandem pore acid-sensing K+ channels (TASK). Here we used H146 cells to investigate the role and interactions of various NADPH oxidase components in O-2-sensing using a combination of coimmunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (quantum dot labeling), and electrophysiology (patchclamp, amperometry) methods. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated formation of molecular complexes between NOX2 and K(v)3.3 and K(v)4.3 ion channels but not with TASK1 ion channels, while NOX4 associated with TASK1 but not with Kv channel proteins. Downregulation of mRNA for NOX2, but not for NOX4, suppressed hypoxia-sensitive outward current and significantly reduced hypoxia -induced 5-HT release. Collectively, our studies suggest that NOX2/K-v complexes are the predominant O-2 sensor in H146 cells and, by inference, in native NEBs. Present findings favor a NEB cell-specific plasma membrane model of O-2-sensing and suggest that unique NOX/K+ channel combinations may serve diverse physiological functions.

First published August 10, 2012; doi: 10.1152/ajplung.00067.2012.-Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are exposed to frequent challenges from inhaled particulates and microbes and function as a first line of defense with a highly regulated immune response because of their unique biology as prototypic alternatively activated macrophages. Lung collectins, particularly surfactant protein A (SP-A), contribute to this activation state by fine-tuning the macrophage inflammatory response. During short-term (10 min-2 h) exposure, SP-A's regulation of human macrophage responses occurs through decreased activity of kinases required for proinflammatory cytokine production. However, AMs are continuously exposed to surfactant, and the biochemical pathways underlying long-term reduction of proinflammatory cytokine activity are not known. We investigated the molecular mechanism(s) underlying SP-A- and surfactant lipid-mediated suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 (TLR4) activation over longer time periods. We found that exposure of human macrophages to SP-A for 6-24 h upregulates expression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase M (IRAK-M), a negative regulator of TLR-mediated NF-kappa B activation. Exposure to Survanta, a natural bovine lung extract lacking SP-A, also enhances IRAK-M expression, but at lower magnitude and for a shorter duration than SP-A. Surfactant-mediated upregulation of IRAK-M in macrophages suppresses TLR4-mediated TNF-alpha and IL-6 production in response to LPS, and IRAK-M knockdown by small interfering RNA reverses this suppression. In contrast to TNF-alpha and IL-6, the surfactant components upregulate LPS-mediated immunoregulatory IL-10 production, an effect reversed by IRAK-M knockdown. In conclusion, these data identify an important signaling regulator in human macrophages that is used by surfactant to control the long-term alveolar inflammatory response, i.e., enhanced IRAK-M activity.

Phylogenies based on 16S rRNA, cbbM, and mam gene sequences were reasonably congruent, indicating that the genes involved in magnetotaxis were acquired by a common ancestor of the Magnetospirillum clade. However, in one case, magnetosome genes might have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Our results also extend the known diversity of the Magnetospirillum group and show that they are widespread in freshwater environments.

Transplantation of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) into the injured spinal cord is emerging as a novel method in the therapeutics of SCI; however, its application is limited by the poor survival rate of the transplanted cells and low differentiation rate into neurons. Our laboratory recently reported that electrical stimulation (ES) dramatically improves the survival rate of transplanted BMSCs and increases spinal cord functions in animals with spinal cord injury. In this paper, we asked whether implanted electro-acupuncture (iEA) can advance the beneficial effects from the ES treatment in animals with spinal cord injury. We showed that BMSCs transplantation alone resulted in significant functional recovery in animals. Interestingly, iEA with BMSCs treatment induced a significantly higher functional improvement in locomotor functions and SSEP compared to the BMSCs treatment alone. Additionally, we used molecular biology techniques and showed that BMSCs transplantation with iEA treatment significantly increased the number of surviving BMSCs compared to the BMSCs alone group. In conclusion, our experiment showed that the approach of coupling iEA electric stimulation and BMSCs transplantation remarkably promotes functional improvements in animals with spinal cord injury and holds promising potential to treat spinal cord injury in humans.

One pathway frequently upregulated during cytotoxic response is macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy). Previously, we demonstrated that pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as the anticancer agent suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat), can induce autophagy. In this study, we show that HDAC inhibition triggers autophagy by suppressing MTOR and activating the autophagic kinase ULK1. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition can sensitize cells to both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death induced by SAHA, suggesting the therapeutic potential of autophagy targeting in combination with SAHA therapy. This study also raised a series of questions: What is the role of HDACs in regulating autophagy? Do individual HDACs have distinct functions in autophagy? How do HDACs regulate the nutrient-sensing kinase MTOR? Since SAHA-induced nonapoptotic cell death is not driven by autophagy, what then is the mechanism underlying the apoptosis-independent death? Tackling these questions should lead to a better understanding of autophagy and HDAC biology and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Here, a new method is presented to obtain the width of the components. This is based on the equivalence between the sigmoidal catalytic response as function of electrode potential, and the classical saturation curve obtained for the enzyme activity as function of the soluble substrate concentration, which is also sigmoidal when plotted versus log[S]. Thus, analysis of the catalytic voltammogram with Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee, and Hanes-Woolf plots is feasible. This provides a very sensitive measure of the cooperativity number (Hill coefficient), which for electrons equals the apparent (fractional) number of electrons that determine the width, and thereby the number of components (kinetic phases). This analysis is applied to the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction by Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome aa(3) (cytochrome c oxidase). Four partially overlapping kinetic phases are observed that (stepwise) increase the catalytic efficiency with increasingly reductive potential. Translated to cell biology, the activity of the terminal oxidase stepwise adapts to metabolic demand for oxidative phosphorylation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Soluble EGF-like ligands are derived from their transmembrane precursors by ADAM proteases, but the identity of the ADAM that is primarily responsible for ligand release and activation of EGFR in TNBCs is not clear. Using publicly available gene expression data for patients with lymph node-negative breast tumors who did not receive systemic treatment, we show that ADAM12L is the only ADAM with an expression level significantly associated with decreased distant metastasis-free survival times. Similar effect was not observed for patients with ER-negative non-TNBCs. There was a positive correlation between ADAM12L and HB-EGF and EGFR in TNBCs, but not in ER-negative non-TNBCs. We further demonstrate that ectopic expression of ADAM12L increased EGFR phosphorylation in a mouse intraductal xenograft model of early breast cancer. Finally, we detect strong correlation between the level of anti-ADAM12L and anti-phospho-EGFR immunostaining in human breast tumors using tissue microarrays. These studies suggest that ADAM12L is the primary protease responsible for the activation of EGFR in early stage, lymph node-negative TNBCs. Thus, our results may provide novel insight into the biology of TNBC.

In the present study, we cultured zebrafish scales at various temperatures and for various times and analyzed the behavior of the bone cells in terms of viability and activity. We demonstrated that the cultured scale cells maintained their usual distribution at 28A degrees C until 72 h, after which time episquamal osteoblasts showed an obvious change in their cell organization followed by an increase in cell death. Osteoclast tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and osteoblast alkaline phosphatase activities were maintained until 72 h but were reduced at 96 h as a consequence of the massive cell death. This scenario indicates that zebrafish scales cultured until 72 h can be considered as an innovative model of explanted organ culture to assay the ability of chemical compounds to modulate the metabolism of bone cells.

Advances in developmental genetics have accumulated to propose the heterotopy theory of jaw evolution, i.e. the jaw evolved as a novelty through a heterotopic shift of mesenchyme-epithelial interaction. According to this theory, the disassociation of the nasohypophyseal complex is a fundamental prerequisite for the origin of the jaw, since the median position of the nasohypophyseal placode in cyclostome head development precludes the forward growth of the neural-crest-derived craniofacial ectomesenchyme. The potential impacts of this disassociation on the origin of the diplorhiny are also discussed from the molecular perspectives. Thus far, our study on the cranial anatomy of galeaspids, a 435-370-million-year-old 'ostracoderm' group from China and northern Vietnam, has provided the earliest fossil evidence for the disassociation of nasohypophyseal complex in vertebrate phylogeny. Using Synchrotron Radiation X-ray Tomography, we further show some derivative structures of the trabeculae (e.g. orbitonasal lamina, ethmoid plate) in jawless galeaspids, which provide new insights into the reorganization of the vertebrate head before the evolutionary origin of the jaw. These anatomical observations based on new techniques highlight the possibility that galeaspids are, in many respects, a better proxy than osteostracans for reconstructing the pre-gnathostome condition of the rostral part of the braincase. The cranial anatomy of galeaspids reveals a number of derived characters uniquely shared with gnathostomes. This raises the potential possibility that galeaspids might be the closest jawless relatives of jawed vertebrates. Our study provides an intriguing example of intersection between developmental biology-based model and fossil evidence.

Seedling emergence patterns are very irregular along the season showing a great year-to-year variability mainly due to a highly unpredictable precipitation regime. Non-linear regression techniques are usually unable to accurately predict field emergence under such environmental conditions. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are known for their capacity to describe highly non-linear relationships among variables thus showing a high potential applicability in ecological systems. The objectives of the present work were to develop different ANN models for A. fatua seedling emergence prediction and to compare their predictive capability against non-linear regression techniques. Classical hydrothermal-time indices were used as input variable for the development of univariate models, while thermal-time and hydro-time were used as independent input variables for developing bivariate models. The accumulated proportion of seedling emergence was the output variable in all cases. A total of 528 input/output data pairs corresponding to 11 years of data collection were used in this study. Obtained results indicate a higher accuracy and generalization performance of the optimal ANN model in comparison to non-linear regression approaches. It is also demonstrated that the use of thermal-time and hydro-time as independent explanatory variables in ANN models yields better prediction than using combined hydrothermal-time indices in classical NLR models. The best obtained ANN model outperformed in 43.3% the best NLR model in terms of RMSE of the test set. Moreover, the best obtained ANN predicted accumulated emergence within the first 50% of total emergence 48.3% better in average than the best developed NLR model. These outcomes suggest the potential applicability of the proposed modeling approach in weed management decision support systems design. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the abundance of portunid crab species and to analyse the influence of environmental factors on the catches per unit effort (CPUE) values of Callinectes danae Smith, 1869 in the canal. The catches included five species: C. danae (the most abundant species), Callinectes marginatus (A. Milne-Edwards, 1861), Callinectes exasperatus (Gerstaecker, 1856), Charybdis hellerii (A. Milne-Edwards, 1867) and Callinectes bocourti A. Milne-Edwards, 1879. The species could be assigned to groups according to their abundance and the values of catches were higher during the dry period. The influences of water temperature, tide height, lunar illumination, salinity, precipitation and season were tested, although the average CPUE (mu) of C. danae for the beach seine and line methods was influenced only by tide height (T) and by salinity (S), according to the model: mu(seine) = exp(3.4921 - 1.3584T) and mu(line) = exp(0.055589S). Within the ranges of the environmental variables included in the study, a tide height of 0.1 m was found to optimize the CPUE of the beach seine (28.68 Ind/h per m(2)).

Using recent insights from developmental psychology and biology, and particularly recent developments in metaphysics of mind, I argue that distinctly human emotionality requires the complex interaction of both. Human neonates and caregivers are genetically preadapted to enable emotional ontogenesis in the context only of a complexly interdependent linguistically-mediated social relationship. This relationship provides the requisite sensory-perceptual stimulation to excite intracellular genetic activity and the resultant development/maturation of emotion-related neural substrata. This genetic preadaptation and the close linguistically-mediated social relationship together provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the gradual development of human adult emotionality.

Hence, developmental programs initiated by specific host cues may be missed in vitro. We have tested the effects of growing low-density agar cultures of the yeast pathogen Candida albicans in concentrations of CO2 found in the gastrointestinal tract. It is demonstrated that in physiological concentrations of CO2 at 37 degrees C, yeast cells form a heretofore undescribed multicellular ""finger"" morphology distinct from a previously described stalk-like structure induced by high doses of UV irradiation that kills more than 99.99% of cells. The finger extends aerially, is uniform in diameter, and is visible to the naked eye, attaining lengths of 3 mm. It is composed of a basal yeast cell monolayer adhering to a semispherical crater formed in the agar and connected to a basal bulb of yeast cells at a fragile interface. The bulb extends into the long shaft. We propose that a single, centrally located hypha extending the length of the shaft forms buds at compartment junctions that serve as the source of the yeast cells in the shaft. A mutational analysis reveals finger formation is dependent upon the pathway Ras1 -> Cdc35 -> cyclicAMP(cAMP) (PDE2-vertical bar)-> Tpk2 -> Tec1. Because of the mechanically fragile interface and the compactness of bulb and shaft, we suggest that the finger may function as a multicellular dispersal mechanism produced in host niches containing high levels of CO2.

Data collection and analysis are also broadly similar for both radiation types. There are fundamental differences, however, between the interaction of X-rays and neutrons with matter, which makes them strongly complementary for structural studies in biology. The property of neutrons to distinguish natural abundance hydrogen from its deuterium isotope and the dispersion relation that leads to the energy of similar to 1 neutrons being of the order of thermal energy are well known. They form the basis, respectively, of contrast variation on the one hand and energy-resolved scattering experiments to study macromolecular dynamics-neutron-specific scattering methods on the other. Interestingly, analysis procedures for the structural and dynamics experiments display common aspects that can be expressed as straight-line relationships. These not only act as controls of good sample preparation, but also yield model-free parameters on an absolute scale that provide fundamental information on the structure and dynamics of the system under study.

X-ray lithography enables the limitations of small-angle X-ray scattering, specifically time resolution and sample environment, to be overcome.

Immunological evidence traces the origin of the sponge bacterial symbioses to the Precambrian era. Hence, sponges appear to be ideally suited for studying the evolutionary origins of prokaryotemetazoan associations. Sponges produce either calcareous or siliceous skeletons, which only coexist in a relict group of demosponges, the sclerosponges. We report here, for the first time, intensive calcification in nonsclerosponge siliceous demosponges. Calcification is mediated by endosymbiotic bacteria (calcibacteria) located in archeocyte-like sponge cells. These calcibacteria are devoid of bacterial walls and divide within sponge cells until they became surrounded by a calcitic sheet, being subsequently extruded to the sponge subectosomal (subepithelial) zone. Thousands of bacteria-produced calcitic spherules cover the surface of the host sponges, forming a cortex-like structure that mimics a rudimentary peripheral skeleton. Calcibacteria are vertically transferred to the sponge larvae during embryogenesis. Calcium detoxification may have generated this symbiotic association, with some additional benefits for the sponges, such as skeletal formation and deterrence from predation. This unique symbiosis holds implications for sponge biology and may advance discussions on the role of bacteria in early biocalcification processes in metazoans.

Depending upon the differences in host quality and transmission asymmetries, as well as the balance between intra- and interspecific transmission, the evolution of specialist or generalist strategies is predicted. Using a trypanosome parasite of bumblebees, we ask how host quality and transmission networks relate to parasite population structure across host species, and thus the potential for the evolution of specialist strains adapted to different host species. Host species differed in quality, with parasite growth varying across host species. Highly asymmetric transmission networks, together with differences in host quality, likely explain local population structure of the parasite across host species. However, parasite population structure across years was highly dynamic, with parasite populations varying significantly from one year to the next within individual species at a given site. This suggests that, while host quality and transmission may provide the opportunity for short-term host specialization by the parasite, repeated bottlenecking of the parasite, in combination with its own reproductive biology, overrides these smaller scale effects, resulting in the evolution of a generalist parasite.

A defining characteristic of the HPV E6 oncoproteins found in cancer-causing HPV types is the presence of a PDZ binding motif at their extreme C-terminus. Through this motif, E6 is able to interact with a large number of cellular proteins that contain PDZ domains. Many of these cellular proteins are involved in regulation of processes associated with the control of cell attachment, cell proliferation, cell polarity and cell signaling. How E6 targets multiple proteins containing the same recognition domain is still an open question.

Testing in a ring- and diffuse-porous species,"Abstract: A 17-parameter species model that predicts metabolic scaling from vascular architecture was tested in a diffuse-porous maple (Acer grandidentatum) and a ring-porous oak (Quercus gambelii). Predictions of midday water transport (Q) and its scaling with above-ground mass (M) were compared with empirical measurements. We also tested the assumption that Q was proportional to the biomass growth rate of the shoot (G). Water transport and biomass growth rate were measured on 18 trees per species that spanned a broad range in trunk diameter (426cm). Where possible, the same trees were used for obtaining the 17 model parameters that concern external branching, internal xylem conduit anatomy, and soil-to-canopy sap pressure drop. The model succeeded in predicting the Q by Mb scaling exponent, b, being within 8% (maple) and 6% (oak) of measured exponents from sap flow data. In terms of absolute Q, the model was better in maple (16% Q overestimate) than oak (128% overestimate). The overestimation of Q was consistent with the model not accounting for cavitation, which is reportedly more prevalent in oak than in maple at the study site. The modelled and measured Q by M b exponents averaged within 3.6% of the measured G by M b exponents, supporting the assumption that G?Q1. The average b exponent was 0.62 +/- 0.016 (mean +/- SE) across species, rejecting b=0.75 for intraspecific scaling. The performance of this species model, both for scaling purposes as well as for predicting rates of water consumption within and between species, argues for its further refinement and wider application in ecology and ecosystem biology.

Interactions between bees and flowers are historically a key topic of research in biology. Apis mellifera is known to forage on a wide variety of flowers to collect nectar and/or pollen. Until now, resource collection strategies were investigated focusing on the influence of single factors on foraging decisions, such as hive requirements, surrounding vegetation, resource availability, seasonality and interactions with other bees. Despite the vast amount of literature on A.mellifera, we lack a comprehensive view of its flower selection. 2. Our aim was to go beyond specific circumstances in order to identify general criteria for flower selection at species level. Applying data mining techniques (Market Basket Analysis), we found that bees exert a precise flower selection choice mainly driven by their pollen requirements. The bees foraged all over the study area with no obvious preference for the close surrounding vegetation. They selected a restricted number of all the available sources, for nectar as well as for pollen. Apis mellifera chose some floral sources more regularly than others. The most recurrent sources changed in time according to subsequent flowering peaks and often corresponded to anemophilous species. The compelling need for pollen revealed the constant demand of a few distinct floral sources. Plants providing huge quantities of pollen, such as wind-pollinated species, were preferred. When the pollen source also provided a good quantity of nectar, foragers collected both resources on the same species. 3. This work on A.mellifera helps to clarify some of the complex aspects of its floral selection processes, which emerge from studies on single colonies, areas or environmental factors influencing individual foraging behaviours. It also suggests that some established theories on pollinatorflower interactions, such as the role of wind-pollinated species, need revision.

Type 3 deiodinase (D3), the selenoenzyme that inactivates thyroid hormone (3,5,3 ' triiodothyronine [T3]), is frequently expressed by tumor cells, but little is known about its role in the regulation of T3 signaling in cancer cells. METHODS: We measured D3 expression in 6 colon cancer cell lines and human tumors and correlated it with the activity of the beta-catenin/TCF complex. We also determined the effects of D3 loss on local thyroid hormone signaling and colon tumorigenesis. RESULTS: We show that D3 is a direct transcriptional target of the beta-catenin/TCF complex; its expression was higher in human intestinal adenomas and carcinomas than in healthy intestinal tissue. Experimental attenuation of beta-catenin reduced D3 levels and induced type 2 deiodinase (the D3 antagonist that converts 3,5,3 ',5 ' tetraiodothyronine into active T3) thereby increasing T3-dependent transcription. In the absence of D3, excess T3 reduced cell proliferation and promoted differentiation in cultured cells and in xenograft mouse models. This occurred via induction of Ecadherin, which sequestered beta-catenin at the plasma membrane and promoted cell differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Deiodinases are at the interface between the beta-catenin and the thyroid hormone pathways. Their synchronized regulation of intracellular T3 concentration is a hitherto unrecognized route by which the multiple effects of beta-catenin are generated and may be targeted to reduce the oncogenic effects of beta-catenin in intestinal cells.

(1) What is the impact of mesoclimatic gradients and dispersal limitation on phylogenetic turnover and species turnover? (2) How does phylogenetic turnover between continents compare in intensity with the turnover driven by climatic gradients at a regional scale? (3) Are independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niche of clades congruent between continents? Location Panama Canal Watershed and Western Ghats (India), two anciently divergent biogeographic contexts but with comparable rainfall gradients. Methods Using floristic data for 50 1-ha plots in each region, independent measures of phylogenetic turnover (?ST) and species turnover (Jaccard) between plots were regressed on geographic and ecological distances. Mesoclimatic niches were reconstructed for each node of the phylogeny and compared between the two continents. Results (1) The phylogenetic turnover within each region is best explained by mesoclimatic differences (environmental filtering), while species turnover depends both on mesoclimatic differences and geographic distances (dispersal limitation). (2) The phylogenetic turnover between continents (?ST = 0.009) is comparable to that caused by mesoclimatic gradients within regions (?ST = 0.010) and both effects seem cumulative. (3) Independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niches were strongly correlated between the two continents (r = 0.61), despite the absence of shared species. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate a world-wide deep phylogenetic signal for mesoclimatic niche within a biome, indicating that positive phylogenetic turnover at a regional scale reflects environmental filtering in plant communities.

Experimentally the level of the secreted cytokine from human fibroblasts was detected with ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) method and subsequently the data were analyzed and coupled with a phenomenological model based on differential equations to evaluate the single-cell release mechanisms.Results: The data confirmed the important effect of radiation on the IL-6 pathway, clearly showing a crucial role of the ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) in transducing the effect of initial radiation exposure and the subsequent long-term release of IL-6. Furthermore, a systematic investigation of radiation dose/radiation quality dependence seems to indicate an increasing efficiency of high LET (Linear Energy Transfer) irradiation in the release of the cytokine. Basic hypotheses were tested, on the correlation between direct radiobiological damage and signal release and on the radiation target for this endpoint (secretion of IL-6)Conclusions: The results demonstrate the role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the signaling pathways of IL-6. Furthermore the systems radiation biology approach here adopted, allowed us to test and verify hypotheses on the behavior of the single cell in the release of cytokine, after the exposure to different doses and different qualities of ionizing radiation.

Pericytes are presumed to be important cellular constituents of the BSCB. However, the regional abundance and vascular functions of spinal cord pericytes have yet to be determined. Utilizing wildtype mice, we show that spinal cord pericyte capillary coverage and number compared with the brain regions are reduced most prominently in the anterior horn. Regional pericyte variations are highly correlated with: (1) increased capillary permeability to 350 Da, 40,0000a, and 150,000 Da, but not 2,000,000 Da fluorescent vascular tracers in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions and (2) diminished endothelial zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin tight junction protein expression. Pericyte-deficient mutations (Pdgfr beta(F7/F7) mice) resulted in additional pericyte reductions in spinal cord capillaries leading to overt BSCB disruption to serum proteins, accumulation in motor neurons of cyotoxic thrombin and fibrin and motor neuron loss. Barrier disruption in perciyte-deficient mice coincided with further reductions in ZO-1 and occludin. These data suggest that pericytes contribute to proper function of the BSCB at the capillary level. Regional reductions in spinal cord pericytes may provide a cellular basis for heightened spinal cord barrier capillary permeability and motor neuron loss.

Extracellular ADP has also been shown to increase osteoclast (OC) activity, but the role of P2RY12 in OC biology is unknown. Here, we examined the role of mouse P2RY12 in OC function. Mice lacking P2ry12 had decreased OC activity and were partially protected from age-associated bone loss. P2ry12(-/-) OCs exhibited intact differentiation markers, but diminished resorptive function. Extracellular ADP enhanced OC adhesion and resorptive activity of WT, but not P2ry12(-/-), OCs. In platelets, ADP stimulation of P2RY12 resulted in GTPase Ras-related protein (RAP1) activation and subsequent alpha(IIb)beta(3) integrin activation. Likewise, we found that ADP stimulation induced RAP1 activation in WT and integrin beta(3) gene knockout (Itgb3(-/-)) OCs, but its effects were substantially blunted in P2ry12(-/-) OCs. In vivo, P2ry12(-/-) mice were partially protected from pathologic bone loss associated with serum transfer arthritis, tumor growth in bone, and ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis: all conditions associated with increased extracellular ADP. Finally, mice treated with the clinical inhibitor of P2RY12, clopidogrel, were protected from pathologic osteolysis. These results demonstrate that P2RY12 is the primary ADP receptor in OCs and suggest that P2RY12 inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for pathologic bone loss.

GATA2 encodes a master regulator of hematopoiesis that is also linked to endothelial biology. Though the disease-causing mutations commonly occur in the GATA-2 DNA binding domain, we identified a patient with mycobacterial infection and myelodysplasia who had an uncharacterized heterozygous deletion in a GATA2 cis-element consisting of an E-box and a GATA motif. Targeted deletion of the equivalent murine element to yield homozygous mutant mice revealed embryonic lethality later than occurred with global Gata2 knockout, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell depletion, and impaired vascular integrity. Heterozygous mutant mice were viable, but embryos exhibited deficits in definitive, but not primitive, hematopoietic stem/progenitor activity and reduced expression of Gata2 and its target genes.

This study investigated the effects of light-emitting diode (LED) exposure on dental pulp cells (DPCs). Dose response analysis at 20-second intervals up to 120 seconds demonstrated that a LED array emitting 653-nm red light stimulated significantly increased cell growth at 3 and 7 days post-irradiation with 40 (149 mJ/cm(2)) and 60 (224 mJ/cm(2)) seconds of radiant exposure. Double-dosing cells at days 1 and 4 of a 7-day culture period with 60-second (224 mJ/cm(2)) LED exposure significantly increased cell growth compared with a single dosing regime. BrdU analysis demonstrated significantly increased proliferation rates associated with significantly increased ATP, nitric oxide (NO), and mitochondrial metabolic activity. LED-stimulated NO levels were not reduced by inhibition of NO-synthase activity. Light exposure also rescued the inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction and increased levels of in vitro mineralization compared with control. Media exchange experiments indicated that autocrine signaling was not likely responsible for red-light-induced DPC activity. In conclusion, data analysis indicated that 653-nm LED irradiation promoted DPC responses relevant to tissue repair, and this is likely mediated by increased mitochondrial activity.

The presence of infected monocytes in the peripheral blood and organs of individuals exhibiting primary HCMV infection have long suggested that these blood sentinels are responsible for mediating viral spread. Despite monocytes being ""at the right place at the right time"", their short lifespan and the lack of productive viral infection in these cells complicate this scenario of a monocyte-driven approach to viral dissemination by HCMV. However, our laboratory has provided evidence that HCMV infection is able to induce a highly controlled polarization of monocytes toward a unique and long-lived proinflammatory macrophage, which we have demonstrated to be permissive for viral replication. These observations suggest that HCMV has evolved as a distinct mechanism to induce select proinflammatory characteristics that provide infected monocytes with the necessary tools to mediate viral spread following a primary infection. In the absence of viral gene products during the early stages of infection, the process by which HCMV ""tunes"" the inflammatory response in infected monocytes to promote viral spread and subsequently, viral persistence remains unclear. In this current review, we focus on the viral entry process of HCMV and the potential role of receptor-ligand interactions in modulating monocyte biology. Specifically, we examine the signaling pathways initiated by the distinct combination of cellular receptors simultaneously engaged and activated by HCMV during viral entry and how the acquisition of this distinct signalsome results in a nontraditional activation of monocytes leading to the induction of the unique, functional attributes observed in monocytes following HCMV infection.

The objective of this prospective study was the analysis obstetrical and neonatal outcome in a cohort of pregnant patients treated for the risk of preterm delivery according to maternal and fetal assessment determined by amniotic fluid samples. Methods. Threatened preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes between 24 + 1 and 32 + 6 weeks of gestation were treated by prolonged tocolytic regimens and if necessary by antibiotics for maternal infections when intra-amniotic inflammation (IAI) was excluded on the basis of negative white blood cell count in the amniotic fluid, or opposite, by delivery after a course of betamethasone and 48 hours maintenance tocolysis. Twenty-three cases were compared with 22 historical controls treated by the same teams according to the 48 hours treat and wait criteria. In addition to this, cases with normal and abnormal amniotic fluid white blood cell were compared. Results. Maternal and fetal conditions at admission were not significantly different between the study and control cohort for all maternal and fetal variables. Clinical indices were significantly improved as regard to latency from admission to delivery, number of newborns admitted to neonatal intensive care unit and length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit. Not any perinatal death or sepsis occurred in the study cohort. Overall, improved neonatal outcomes were observed in the study cohort. Composite major neonatal eventuful outcomes occurred in 26% of cases vs. 50% in controls. The limited number of cases was not powered enough to reach a statistical significance for these variables. Continued tocolysis on demand and full regimen of mono or combined antibiotic regimen for maternal infection acheived significnatly longer delay between admission to delivery with improved in neonatal outcome in cases negative for IAI: only 2 of 14 newborns suffered of major neonatal complications vs. 4 of 9 newborns delivered for IAI. Conclusions. Fetuses without IAI can be treated conservatively and their stay in utero prolonged without harm. However, we confirmed that when IAI is already active in utero a worse neonatal outcome is already partly predetermined. These positive findings must be interpreted with cautions given the limited number of cases considered by this study.

Site fidelity could not consistently explain this pattern. Because amphibians are known to select oviposition sites according to certain habitat characteristics, we investigated pond parameters that may drive breeding site selection in that area. We recorded 44 abiotic and biotic parameters, including variables within-ponds, predator presence, as well as habitat characteristics of the terrestrial area surrounding the ponds. However, multifactorial statistics such as non-metric multidimensional scaling, hierarchical clustering and random forest algorithm as well as single-factor comparisons could not highlight common habitat features of chosen ponds. The results of this study indicate that breeding site choice is more than a pure function of habitat characteristics, and that understanding the reproductive biology, even of such a widespread species as R.?temporaria, needs more research effort.

We also tested whether the timing of spring migration is predicted by annual variation in temperature or precipitation. More toads migrate in warmer temperatures and as the moon waxes, whereas precipitation did not have a significant effect on toad activity. Across years, spring migration begins earlier in warmer years, but the main migration of toads was not predicted by air temperatures before the onset of the breeding season. Contrary to the majority of studies of amphibian breeding phenology, there has been a temporal shift towards later timing of breeding over the past 12 years. Overall, comparison of our results with that of previous studies suggests that it can be difficult to generalize about the factors that influence breeding phenology, even within species. However, as more studies accumulate, it should be possible to address whether variation in breeding phenology is consistently linked to geographic variation in abiotic conditions or species biology, which will help to evaluate its consequences under climate change.

By means of capture-marking-recapture, we estimated survival and capture probabilities in an open population. A total of 583 captures of 374 individuals, comprising 96% male (n = 353) and 4% females (n = 21), resulted in daily survival estimates ranging from 0.808 to 0.998 day-1. The number of individuals captured per capture session varied from 8 to 37 (mean = 21) and was correlated with night length, after a two session lag time (r = 0.78). Males were found vocalizing throughout the year, while females were less common and gravid females were only found in November, March and June. Recapture probability was relatively constant at 25% for males, 24% for females and, overall, 29% of males were recaptured at least once. Young individuals were encountered in all months but one and, being extremely small, were impossible to quantify. Thus, the Striped Frog is active and breeding year-round as indicated by the constant singing of adult males, the few gravid females found at different times and the frequent encounters of young frogs at all times of year. While survival and captures varied throughout the year, the only seasonality was in the number of captures that increased during longer nights. Nonetheless, recapture probability was constant. These dynamics contrast strongly with most anuran species and especially subtropical and temperate species in other places. This first detailed study of population parameters of a subtropical species with its unusual dynamics may suggest that once studied, other species of anurans may also have surprising population dynamics.

We explored all the flexibility offered by this commercial confocal microscope to include the nonlinear microscopy capabilities. The setup allows image acquisition with confocal, brightfield, NLO/multiphoton and FLIM imaging. Simultaneously, two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and SHG are well established in the biomedical imaging area, because one can use the same ultrafast laser and detectors set to acquire both signals simultaneously. Because the integration with FLIM requires a separated modulus, there are fewer reports of TPEF+SHG+FLIM in the literature. The lack of reports of a TPEF+SHG+THG+FLIM system is mainly due to difficulties with THG because the present NLO laser sources generate THG in an UV wavelength range incompatible with microscope optics. In this article, we report the development of an easy-to-operate platform capable to perform two-photon fluorescence (TPFE), SHG, THG, and FLIM using a single 80 MHz femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser source. We described the modifications over the confocal system necessary to implement this integration and verified the presence of SHG and THG signals by several physical evidences.

Although critically important, they limit hypothesis generation to an incremental pace. Machine learning and data mining are alternative approaches to identifying new vistas to pursue, as is already evident in the literature. In concert with these analytic strategies, novel approaches to data collection can enhance the hypothesis pipeline as well. In data farming, data are obtained in an 'organic' way, in the sense that it is entered by patients themselves and available for harvesting. In contrast, in evidence farming (EF), it is the provider who enters medical data about individual patients. EF differs from regular electronic medical record systems because frontline providers can use it to learn fromtheir own past experience. In addition to the possibility of generating large databases with farming approaches, it is likely that we can further harness the power of large data sets collected using either farming or more standard techniques through implementation of data-mining and machine-learning strategies. Exploiting large databases to develop new hypotheses regarding neurobiological and genetic underpinnings of psychiatric illness is useful in itself, but also affords the opportunity to identify novel mechanisms to be targeted in drug discovery and development.

Here, we report that an AKT1 variant (rs1130233) previously associated with AKT1 protein expression, prefrontal function and schizophrenia, affects human MTL structure and memory function. Further, supporting AKT1's role in transducing hippocampal neuroplasticity and dopaminergic processes, we found epistasis with functional polymorphisms in BDNF and COMT-genes also implicated in MTL biology related to AKT1. Consistent with prior predictions that these biologic processes relate to schizophrenia, we found epistasis between the same AKT1, BDNF and COMT functional variants on schizophrenia risk, and pharmacogenetic interactions of AKT1 with the effects on cognition and brain volume measures by AKT1 activators in common clinical use-lithium and sodium valproate. Our findings suggest that AKT1 affects risk for schizophrenia and accompanying cognitive deficits, at least in part through specific genetic interactions related to brain neuroplasticity and development, and that these AKT1 effects may be pharmacologically modulated in patients.

Because direct pharmacological inhibition of the RAS proto-oncogene has thus far been unsuccessful, we explored systems biology approaches to identify synergistic drug combination(s) that can mimic RAS inhibition. Here, leveraging an inducible mouse model of NRAS-mutant melanoma, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activates apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest, which is in contrast to complete genetic neuroblastoma RAS homolog (NRAS) extinction, which triggers both of these effects. Network modeling pinpointed cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key driver of this differential phenotype. Accordingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial synergy in therapeutic efficacy. We suggest a gradient model of oncogenic NRAS signaling in which the output is gated, resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological phenotypes as a result of incomplete inhibition. Such a gated signaling model offers a new framework to identify nonobvious coextinction target(s) for combined pharmacological inhibition in NRAS-mutant melanomas.

The family of Aurora kinases, composed of Aurora A, B and C, takes a major role in the control of centrosome cycle, mitotic entry, chromosome condensation and coordination of chromosomal movements. Deregulation of kinase expression was described in a series of different malignancies which was also associated with aneuploidy.

The aim of this investigation was to explore what additional prognostic information could be gained from detailed histomorphologic report. Patients and method: patients were selected retrospectively operated from 2005 to 2009 in one institution and charts were revised. Beyond age, tumour and nodal status, histologic grade and therapy, the additional pathologic characteristics were also involved in analysis: necrosis, lymphocytic infiltration, peritumoural vascular invasion (PVI), perineural invasion, DCIS extent and grade, perinodal spread, mitotic activity index (MAI). Results: 295 early TNBC were involved. In univariate survival analysis with a mean follow-up of 3.57 years the tumour size, the nodal status, type of operation (conservation or mastectomy), irradiation, PVI and perinodal spread proved to be significantly connected with both disease free survival (DFS) and breast cancer specific overall survival (BSOS), and necrosis and chemotherapy with BSOS.

In multivariate analysis nodal metastasis, necrosis positive/lymphacytic infiltration negative status and lack of irradiation has significant negative impact on DFS (p = < 0.0001 HR:1.98 [1.4-2.77], p = < 0.017 HR:2.1 [1.1-3.8], p = < 0.001 HR:0.25 [0.11-0.57], respectively) and BSOS (p = < 0.0001 HR:2.47 [1.8-3.4], p = < 0.017 HR:3.7 [1.6-8.2], p = < 0.0017 HR:0.24 [0.1-0.58], respectively). For DFS perivascular invasion also showed significant effect (p = < 0.042 HR:2.5 [1.0-6.0]). Nodal status was the strongest prognostic parameter but other histomorphologic parameters can be used for prognosis prediction.

A major application of these pathways is generating a large amount of the desired product. However, toxicity due to the possible presence of toxic precursors is one of the main problems for such production. We consider here the problem of generating a large amount of product from a potentially toxic substrate. To address this, we propose a simple biosynthetic pathway, which can be induced in order to produce a large number of the product molecules, by keeping the substrate amount at low levels. Surprisingly, we show that the large product generation crucially depends on fast non-specific degradation of the substrate molecules. We derive an optimal induction strategy, which allows as much as three orders of magnitude increase in the product amount through biologically realistic parameter values. We point to a recently discovered bacterial immune system (CRISPR/Cas in E. coli) as a putative example of the pathway analysed here. We also argue that the scheme proposed here can be used not only as a stand-alone pathway, but also as a strategy to produce a large amount of the desired molecules with small perturbations of endogenous biosynthetic pathways.

While quantitative and continuous models such as differential equations have been widely used, their use is obstructed in systems wherein the knowledge of mechanistic details and kinetic parameters is scarce. On the other hand, a wealth of molecular level qualitative data on individual components and interactions can be obtained from the experimental literature and high-throughput technologies, making qualitative approaches such as Boolean network modeling extremely useful. In this paper, we build on our research to provide a methodology overview of Boolean modeling in systems biology, including Boolean dynamic modeling of cellular networks, attractor analysis of Boolean dynamic models, as well as inferring biological regulatory mechanisms from high-throughput data using Boolean models. We finally demonstrate how Boolean models can be applied to perform the structural analysis of cellular networks. This overview aims to acquaint life science researchers with the basic steps of Boolean modeling and its applications in several areas of systems biology.

First, a new method for estimating daily sperm production was validated. This method, in turn, was used to evaluate testis output as well as deferent duct throughput. Next, this analytical approach was evaluated in 2 experiments. The first experiment compared left and right reproductive tracts within roosters. The second experiment compared reproductive tract throughput in roosters from low and high sperm mobility lines. Standard curves were constructed from which unknown concentrations of sperm cells and sperm nuclei could be predicted from observed absorbance. In each case, the independent variable was based upon hemacytometer counts, and absorbance was a linear function of concentration. Reproductive tracts were excised, semen recovered from each duct; and the extragonadal sperm reserve determined by multiplying volume by sperm cell concentration. Testicular sperm nuclei were procured by homogenization of a whole testis, overlaying a 20-mL volume of homogenate upon 15% (wt/vol) Accudenz (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation, Westbury, NY), and then washing nuclei by centrifugation through the Accudenz layer. Daily sperm production was determined by dividing the predicted number of sperm nuclei within the homogenate by 4.5 d (i.e., the time sperm with elongated nuclei spend within the testis). Sperm transit through the deferent duct was estimated by dividing the extragonadal reserve by daily sperm production. Neither the efficiency of sperm production (sperm per gram of testicular parenchyma per day) nor deferent duct transit differed between left and right reproductive tracts (P > 0.05). Whereas efficiency of sperm production did not differ (P > 0.05) between low and high sperm mobility lines, deferent duct transit differed between lines (P < 0.001). On average, this process required 2.2 and 1.0 d for low and high lines, respectively. In summary, we developed and then tested a method for quantifying male reproductive tract throughput. This method makes the study of semen production amenable to systems biology.

Discoveries during the 1970s that identified genetic influences on political orientations remained unaddressed. However, over the past decade, an unprecedented amount of scholarship utilizing genetic models to expand the understanding of political traits has emerged. Here, we review the 'genetics of politics', focusing on the topics that have received the most attention: attitudes, ideologies, and pro-social political traits, including voting behavior and participation. The emergence of this research has sparked a broad paradigm shift in the study of political behaviors toward the inclusion of biological influences and recognition of the mutual co-dependence between genes and environment in forming political behaviors.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are two multifunctional cytokines implicated in inflammation, immunity, and cellular organization, and were proposed to play important roles in cancer biology. In order to determine whether IL-10 -1082 (G/A) and TNF-alpha -238 (G/A) and -308 (G/A) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to cervical cancer, a case-control study of 122 cancer patients and 176 healthy controls was conducted. Cervical samples were genotyped for both TNF-alpha polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP assay. SNP-1082 from IL-10 gene was genotyped using pyrosequencing technology. The association between cervical cancer risk and the studied SNPs was evaluated by logistic regression. Under univariate analysis, none of these polymorphisms appeared associated with susceptibility of cervical cancer development or HPV infection. However, individuals carrying heterozygous genotype for TNF-alpha -238 polymorphism seem to be at lower risk for cervical cancer development, with borderline significance (OR = 0.42, P = 0.069), as well as those carrying heterozygous genotypes for IL-10 and TNF-alpha -238 (OR = 0.40, P = 0.08). In conclusion, these results suggest a potential effect of TNF-alpha -238 G/A in the reduction of cervical cancer risk in Argentine women, but not TNF-alpha -308 or IL-10.

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare widely used tumour models to select the ones most suitable for angiogenesis research. Fifteen murine tumours were selected including melanoma (B16), colon (C26, C38, C51), mammary (MA13, MA16, MA16/Adr, MA17, MA17/Adr, MA25, MA44), pancreatic (PO2, PO3), Glasgow osteogenic sarcoma (GOS) and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). The tumour vascular density, assessed using the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1; CD31) immunostaining, revealed that B16 melanoma was poorly vascularized (< 5 %), whereas the colon and mammary tumours were well vascularized (5-15 %). The most vascularized tumours (> 15 %) were the pancreatic tumours (PO2 and PO3), the sarcoma (GOS) and the lung tumour (LLC). The integrin alpha v beta 3 and E-selectin, evaluated by immunohistology, showed that 7/15 tumours expressed the alpha v beta 3 integrin which was homogeneously distributed on all tumour sections (B16, C26, MA17/Adr, MA25, MA44, PO2, LLC). E-selectin was expressed in 4/15 tumours and its expression was restricted to the tumour periphery. Only 2/15 tumours (B16 and C26) were shown to express both integrin alpha v beta 3 and E-selectin. In conclusion, these data not only contribute to a better understanding of the tumour biology of murine tumours but can also guide the choice of appropriate models for antiangiogenic therapy, for selective drug delivery to tumours and the validation of tumour imaging modalities targeting these endothelial cell adhesion molecules.

Comparison of drug levels and anti-drug antibody monitoring is hampered by lack of standardisation. Aim To determine the correlation between three different assays for measuring infliximab and ATI. Methods Serum samples and spiked controls (total 62) were evaluated in a blinded way in infliximab and ATI assays developed by Sanquin Amsterdam, Netherlands (A), Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Biology, KU Leuven, Belgium (B) and a commercially available kit from Biomedical Diagnostics (BMD), Paris, France (C) performed by the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Netherlands. Results All infliximab assays showed a linear quantitative correlation (Pearson r = 0.91 for A vs. B, 0.83 for A vs. C and 0.73 for B vs. C). Assay C detected infliximab in 11 samples (18%) not detected by A and B, including samples containing only ATI. All ATI assays showed a good linear correlation (Pearson r = 0.95 for A vs. B, 0.99 for A vs. C and 0.97 for B vs. C). Assay A detected ATI in five samples with low ATI that were not detected by assays B and C. Assay B did not detect ATI in three patient samples with low ATI according to assays A and C.

This disease has caused millions of dollars in losses to the potato industry. Whole crops might be rejected because of ZC, often leading to abandonment of entire fields. Plant growth and yield are severely affected by the disease. Additionally, chips or fries processed from ZC-infected tubers exhibit dark stripes that become markedly more visible with frying, and hence are commercially unacceptable. The disease causes serious losses to the fresh market, tablestock and export potato industry as well. ZC-infected tubers usually do not sprout and if they do, produce hair sprouts or weak plants. Finally, there are indications that ZC symptoms might develop in tubers during storage. ZC has been associated with a previously undescribed species of liberibacter, tentatively named ""Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum"", also known as ""Ca. L. psyllaurous"". The bacterium is transmitted to potato by the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (ulc). All commercial potato cultivars appear to be susceptible to ZC, and management tactics targeted against the potato psyllid are currently the only means to effectively manage the disease. Furthermore, there are concerns about quarantine and trade issues in psyllid-affected regions because some countries may require that shipments of potatoes from certain growing regions be tested for the disease before the shipments are allowed entry. ZC history, geographic distribution, biology, epidemiology, and management are discussed herein.

Immunohistochemistry, including whole-mount staining of early implantation sites, separation of uNK cells into molecularly distinct subsets, and physiologic measurements in normal and mutant mice, are further advancing understanding of uNK cell biology. Results Literature analyses revealed three key, current uNK cell research themes: angiogenesis, spiral arterial remodeling/pre-eclampsia/hypertension and infertility. UNK cells are being defined as cells potentially regulated by Wnt signaling that are heterogeneous in progenitor source and function and make unique contributions to implantation site development prior to spiral arterial remodeling.

Characterization of the distribution and imaging characteristics of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and autologous blood after injection is currently limited despite the growing use. We sought to improve understanding of the distribution of PRP or autologous blood after it has been injected into a tendon to evaluate whether injected materials truly stayed within the local region of injection.MATERIALS AND METHODS. Fifty ultrasound-guided PRP or autologous blood injections performed for tendinopathy were retrospectively reviewed. Consensus review of the imaging data was performed by two radiologists to characterize the distribution of the injectate (i.e., within the tendon, along the tendon sheath, along the paratenon, or leakage into the adjacent joint or surrounding soft tissues). The presence of fluid and microbubbles from the injectate served as an indicator of material distribution.RESULTS. Image review verified the injectate within the tendon in 100% of cases. In 98% of reviewed cases, injected PRP or autologous blood dissected beyond the local injection site (defined as > 2 cm from the site of injection) and was identified in adjacent soft tissues in 51% of cases. Visualization of injectate along a paratenon or tendon sheath (when applicable) was seen in 86% and 100% of cases respectively; however, intraarticular extension was uncommon (8%).CONCLUSION. Our study showed that postinjection imaging may be of value in assessing the anatomic distribution of injectate after intratendinous therapy. Furthermore, our initial review found that in the majority of cases injected blood products tended to distribute beyond the local area of injection.

In the present work a convenient, inexpensive route to multiple-charged amino acid building blocks with varying degree of hydrophobicity was developed. A versatile solid-phase protocol leading to selectively protected amino alcohol intermediates was followed by oxidation to yield the desired di- or polycationic amino acid building blocks in gram-scale amounts. The synthetic sequence comprises loading of (S)-1-(p-nosyl)aziridine-2-methanol onto a freshly prepared trityl bromide resin, followed by ring opening with an appropriate primary amine, on-resin N-beta-Boc protection of the resulting secondary amine, exchange of the N-alpha-protecting group, cleavage from the resin, and finally oxidation in solution to yield the target gamma-aza substituted building blocks having an Fmoc/Boc protection scheme. This strategy facilitates incorporation of multiple positive charges into the building blocks provided that the corresponding partially protected di- or polyamines are available. An array of compounds covering a wide variety of gamma-aza substituted analogs of simple neutral amino acids as well as analogs displaying high bulkiness or polycationic side chains was prepared. Two building blocks were incorporated into peptide sequences using microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis confirming their general utility.

Devastating, hitherto unsuspected impacts of predatory house mice on breeding seabirds have been described recently. We studied the fate of 178 Atlantic Petrel Pterodroma incerta nests at Gough Island, over four seasons, from October 2003 to January 2008. Introduced house mice Mus musculus were found in all study burrows checked for mouse visits. From October 2003 to September 2004, we video-recorded attacks by mice on six (of 13) live, healthy Atlantic Petrel chicks and on one (of three) great shearwater Puffinus gravis chicks. In all years, chicks died from mouse attacks. Stage-specific daily nest survival rates were modelled, from which estimates of breeding success were derived that accounted for the variable exposure periods studied among years. Average daily survival rate of eggs was 0.998, and hatching success through the entire incubation period (55.5 days) was 0.924 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9030.940]. Daily chick survival rates were 0.990, which gave a modelled fledging success of 0.247 (CI 0.1650.338) over the 138-day chick period, and average annual breeding success (chicks fledged per breeding attempt) of 0.228 (CI 0.1500.318), which is low compared with congeners. Productivity estimates were used as a parameter in a population simulation model, which predicted a population multiplication rate (?) of 0.993 (CI?=?0.9661.021). However, in the one season studied from laying to fledging (2007), from 58 nests, only one chick fledged (1.7%). This suggests the wide errors on the model results may obscure a more severe reality. More than 60% of model simulations resulted in an International Union for Conservation of Nature classification of Endangered. Our results add support to calls to eradicate mice from Gough Island. More generally, mice cannot be ignored as a potential threat to island fauna, and island restoration and management plans should routinely include eradication of introduced mice.

However, few delayed selfing mechanisms have been documented. This research aims to explore a new delayed selfing mechanism induced by stigmatic fluid in Roscoea debilis, a small perennial ginger.Floral biology and flower visitors were surveyed. The capacity of autonomous selfing was evaluated by pollinator exclusion. The timing of autonomous selng was estimated by emasculation at different flowering stages. The number of seeds produced from insect-pollination was assessed by emasculation and exposure to pollinators in the natural population. The breeding system was also tested by pollination manipulations.Autonomous self-pollination occurred after flowers wilted. The stigmatic fluid formed a globule on the stigma on the third day of flowering. The enlarged globule seeped into the nearby pollen grains on the fourth flowering day, thus inducing pollen germination. Pollen tubes then elongated and penetrated the stigma. Hand-selfed flowers produced as many seeds as hand-crossed flowers. There was no significant difference in seed production between pollinator-excluded flowers and hand-selfed flowers. When emasculated flowers were exposed to pollinators, they produced significantly fewer seeds than intact flowers. Visits by effective pollinators were rare.This study describes a new form of delayed autonomous self-pollination. As the predominant mechanism of sexual reproduction in R. debilis, delayed self-pollination ensures reproduction when pollinators are scarce.

Massspectroscopy genotyping for somatic gene mutations in CLM was performed in a subset of 129 patients.Results: Adjuvant treatment for primary CRC was FOLFOX in 77 patients, 5-FU in 169 patients, and no chemotherapy in 95 patients. Node-positive primary was comparable between FOLFOX and 5-FU but lower in the nochemotherapy group (P < 0.0001). Median metastasis size was smaller in the FOLFOX group (2.5 cm) than in the 5-FU (3.0 cm) or no-chemotherapy (3.5 cm) groups, (P = 0.008) although prehepatectomy chemotherapy utilization, metastases number, and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were similar. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates after hepatectomy were worse in patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX [DFS at 3 years: 14% vs 38% (5-FU) vs 45% (no-chemo), OS at 3 years: 58% vs 70% (5-FU) vs 84% (no-chemo)]. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant FOLFOX was associated with worse DFS (P < 0.0001) and OS (P < 0.0001).

We evaluated surgical management and outcomes of patients with duodenal GISTs treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) versus local resection (LR) and defined factors associated with prognosis.Between January 1994 and January 2011, 96 patients with duodenal GISTs were identified from five major surgical centers. Perioperative and long-term outcomes were compared based on surgical approach (PD vs LR).A total of 58 patients (60.4 %) underwent LR, while 38 (39.6 %) underwent PD. Patients presented with gross bleeding (n = 25; 26.0 %), pain (n = 23; 24.0 %), occult bleeding (n = 19; 19.8 %), or obstruction (n = 3; 3.1 %). GIST lesions were located in first (n = 8, 8.4 %), second (n = 47; 49 %), or third/fourth (n = 41; 42.7 %) portion of duodenum. Most patients (n = 86; 89.6 %) had negative surgical margins (R0) (PD, 92.1 vs LR, 87.9 %) (P = 0.34). Median length of stay was longer for PD (11 days) versus LR (7 days) (P = 0.001). PD also had more complications (PD, 57.9 vs LR, 29.3 %) (P = 0.005). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year actuarial recurrence-free survival was 94.2, 82.3, and 67.3 %, respectively. Factors associated with a worse recurrence-free survival included tumor size [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.09], mitotic count > 10 mitosis/50 HPF (HR = 6.89), AJCC stage III disease (HR = 4.85), and NIH high risk classification (HR = 4.31) (all P < 0.05). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival was 98.3, 87.4, and 82.0%, respectively. PD versus LR was not associated with overall survival.Recurrence of duodenal GIST is dependent on tumor biology rather than surgical approach. PD was associated with longer hospital stays and higher risk of perioperative complications. When feasible, LR is appropriate for duodenal GIST and PD should be reserved for lesions not amenable to LR.

Some of these microbes cause systemic infections associated with immunosuppressive conditions, such as chemotherapy for cancer, immunosuppressive therapy for transplant, autoimmune conditions, and AIDS; while others usually cause localized infection in immunocompetent individuals. Other factors related to this increase in incidence are: antibiotic resistance, not well defined taxonomy, and a delay in isolation and identification of the offending microbe. Examples of these infections are systemic disease and brain abscesses produced by Nocardia asteroides or the located disease by Nocardia brasiliensis, named actinomycetoma. During the Pathogenic Actinomycetes Symposium of the 16th International Symposium on Biology of Actinomycetes (ISBA), held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, several authors presented recent research on the mechanisms by which N. brasiliensis modulates the immune system to survive in the host and advances in medical treatment of human actinomycetoma. Antibiotics and antimicrobials that are effective against severe actinomycetoma infections with an excellent therapeutic outcome and experimental studies of drugs that show promising bacterial inhibition in vivo and in vitro were presented. Here we demonstrate a systemic strong acquired immune response in humans and experimental mice at the same time of a local dominance of anti inflammatory cytokines environment. The pathogenic mechanisms of some actinomycetes include generation of an immunosuppressive micro environment to evade the protective immune response. This information will be helpful in understanding pathogenesis and to design new drugs for treatment of actinomycetoma.

The revelation of interactions among CHPV proteins can help in gaining insight into viral architecture and pathogenesis. In the current study, we carried out comprehensive yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analysis to elucidate intraviral protein-protein interactions. All of the interactions identified by Y2H were assessed for reliability by GST pull-down and ELISA. A total of eight interactions were identified among four viral proteins. Five of these interactions are being reported for the first time for CHPV. Among these, the glycoprotein (G)-nucleocapsid (N) interaction could be considered novel, as this has not been reported for any members of the family Rhabdoviridae. This study provides a framework within which the roles of the identified protein interactions can be explored further for understanding the biology of this virus at the molecular level.

We have previously shown that SMC apoptosis stimulates proinflammatory signaling in a mouse model of AAA. Here, we test whether protein kinase C-delta (PKC delta), an apoptotic mediator, participates in the pathogenesis of AAA by regulating apoptosis and proinflammatory signals.Methods and Results-Mouse experimental AAA is induced by perivascular administration of CaCl2. Mice deficient in PKC delta exhibit a profound reduction in aneurysmal expansion, SMC apoptosis, and transmural inflammation as compared with wild-type littermates. Delivery of PKC delta to the aortic wall of PKC delta(-/-) mice restores aneurysm, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative PKC delta mutant in the aorta of wild-type mice attenuates aneurysm. In vitro, PKC delta(-/-) aortic SMCs exhibit significantly impaired monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production. Ectopic administration of recombinant monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 to the arterial wall of PKC delta(-/-) mice restores inflammatory response and aneurysm development.Conclusion-PKC delta is an important signaling mediator for SMC apoptosis and inflammation in a mouse model of AAA. By stimulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in aortic SMCs, upregulated PKC delta exacerbates the inflammatory process, in turn perpetuating elastin degradation and aneurysmal dilatation. Inhibition of PKC delta may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for AAA. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2012; 32: 2493-2502.)

The differential expression of genes related to intestinal development during suckling time was investigated using a porcine genome array. Time sequence profiles were analyzed for the differentially expressed genes to obtain significant expression profiles. Subsequently, the most significant profiles were assayed using Gene Ontology categories, pathway analysis, network analysis, and analysis of gene co-expression to unveil the main biological processes, the significant pathways, and the effective genes, respectively,. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to verify the reliability of the results of the analysis of the array.

Among the 30 significant obtained model profiles, profiles 66 and 13 were the most significant. Analysis of profiles 66 and 13 indicated that they were mainly involved in immunity, metabolism, and cell division or proliferation. Among the most effective genes in these two profiles, CN161469, which is similar to methylcrotonoyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase 2 (beta), and U89949.1, which encodes a folate binding protein, had a crucial influence on the co-expression network.

Here, we use scanning electron microscopy to test the hypothesis that orthodentine microwear patterns in extant xenarthrans are significantly different among different dietary groups. In a blind analysis, microwear patterns were quantified at a magnification of 500x by two independent observers for extant species from four dietary groups (carnivoreomnivores, folivores, frugivorefolivores, and insectivores). Independent observers recovered the same relative between-group differences in microwear patterns. Insectivores and folivores have a significantly lower numbers of scratches and greater scar widths than frugivorefolivores and carnivoreomnivores, yet we were neither able to statistically distinguish insectivores from folivores, nor differentiate frugivorefolivores from carnivoreomnivores. Nevertheless, a clear distinction exists between taxa from the same trophic level and habitat, which suggests that orthodentine microwear reflects niche partitioning and habitat more than diet among related forms. We suggest that bite force and chewing mechanics have a strong influence on the formation of orthodentine microwear, which may explain some of the observed overlap between distinct groups (e.g. frugivorefolivores versus carnivoreomnivores). This study serves as a positive step forwards in our understanding of the ecological role of living xenarthrans, and serves as a foundation for using orthodentine microwear to reconstruct palaeoecology in extinct ground sloths, glyptodonts, and pampatheres.

Consequently, islands have been key model systems in our understanding of evolutionary theory. The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) is of interest as it has invaded French Atlantic islands within the last few thousand years and is considered to be morphologically and genetically stable in this area. In this article, we study the shape of the mandible of the greater white-toothed shrew on four islands and compare it with that of individuals from populations on the mainland to quantify the effects of insularity. The degree of insularity (i.e. island size and distance to the continent) is thought to be linked to differences in ecological characteristics of islands compared with the mainland. We used geometric morphometric analyses to quantify differences in size and shape between populations and employed a simple biomechanical model to evaluate the potential effects of shape differences on bite force. Specimens from island populations are different from continental populations in shape and mechanical potential of the mandible. Among islands, the mandible shows various shapes that are correlated with both the distance from the coast and island area. The shape differences are located on different parts of the mandible, suggesting different ecological constraints on each island. Moreover, these shapes are linked to the mechanical potential, which is markedly different between islands. Mechanical potential has been suggested to evolve in response to prey size and or mechanical properties. In conclusion, our results show that, in spite of the relatively recent colonization of the Atlantic Islands, the mandible of C.?russula possesses a distinct shape. Moreover, the shape differs among islands and is probably linked to the consumption of different prey. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, , .

We examined spatial patterns of genetic and phenotypic variability among Galaxias maculatus populations in a complex of four postglacial lakes in northwestern Patagonia differing in size and connectivity among them. A hierarchical Bayesian analysis grouped the individuals collected from eleven localities into three genetic clusters, first defining the populations of the two large lakes and separating the two small lakes in subsequent analysis. Genetic structuring was restricted within large lakes. It is known that the larval stage of Galaxias maculatus migrate to the limnetic zone of Patagonian lakes, possibly exerting an homogenizing effect on gene flow within lakes. Gene flow asymmetry and divergences among lakes can be explained by a combination of landscape characteristics and the presence of predators in the short streams that connect them. Individuals from the small lakes are the most divergent morphologically and genetically. The population in the isolated Redonda Lake, exhibits meristic differences as well, suggesting strong drift and environmental effects. This population is likely to have been isolated following the decline in water level of a paleolake that existed in this region approximately 13.2?kya BP.

(Boraginaceae),"Abstract: The present study comprises an analysis of six different scoring schemes and eight different types of analytic methods aiming to investigate the evolution of a continuous character (i.e. corolla tube length) in Lithospermum L. (Boraginaceae). Corolla tube length in the genus is quite variable, ranging from 1?mm to 75?mm, and the length of the corolla tube has implications for pollination biology, such as longer corolla tubes (>?25?mm in length) being pollinated by hummingbirds or moths. In general, the various methods resolve similar ancestral character states; however, different states are reconstructed at nodes in which the descendants greatly differ in corolla tube length. Additionally, it is suggested that all of the variation of a continuous character should be included in analyses, and this may necessitate multiple analyses with different partitions of the data. The various analyses provide evidence that two maximum parsimony methods, linear parsimony and the TNT method, minimize the number of different rates of evolution. In Lithospermum, six origins of corolla tubes >?20?mm in length are resolved, and these origins occurred at two different times periods: (1) in the shadow of hummingbird diversification in North America (approximately 68?Mya) and (2) more recently (approximately 11.5?MyA). Four substantial decreases in corolla tube length also are reconstructed, and these may be associated with the origin of self-pollination.

Nurse theorists often note the establishment of a therapeutic relationship as the beginning point of caring, with subsequent nursing interventions reliant upon this relationship for effectiveness. Relational exchange serves as a source of either stress or healing between participants, and rarely is its impact neutral. Relational stress, in fact, has become a primary contributor to many disease processes in terms of promotion and progression and perhaps even initiation. Patient-provider relationships have a long history in medical and nursing literature as critical to providing effective interventions, but our understanding of relational dynamics between patients and providers remains fairly superficial. This theoretical article adapts a previously described biobehavioral model to illustrate the nature and centrality of caring relationships in nursing practice. The dynamic process of face-to-face engagement is deconstructed from a psychobiological standpoint in order to understand the physiological, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral impacts of relational interaction. This understanding is then applied to the patient-provider relationship. Finally, the utility of biomarkers of stress, positive emotion and resonance, and of disease is discussed relative to the patient-provider relationship. Methodological and interpretive challenges inherent in this line of research, along with suggestions to address such challenges, are also presented.

However, the procedure is labor intensive and time consuming. Microfluidic chip-based microarrays save time with better performance, but the low spot density and probe number limit its applications. To develop high performance microarrays with high spot density within a microchannel, a method is reported here for preparing microarrays in a capillary by generating probe droplet arrays. The probes in droplets are immobilized onto the inner wall of the capillary to form a one-dimensional probe array, and then a sample solution is introduced to hybridize with the probe array. The effect of the capillary's inner diameter was evaluated to realize a high-density probe array. The processes of array generation and probe immobilization were studied to avoid possible cross contamination. The background from probe immobilization during the array generation and incubation was quantified to assure sensitivity. Multiple sample detection was also demonstrated within one capillary. The capillary based microarray assay had high spot density, easy fabrication, fast detection, high sensitivity and multiple sample capacity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

All species investigated offer a nectar reward (mean values of total sugars ranging from 18 to 26%) concealed in a spur. Habenaria montevidensis is pollinated by butterflies (Hesperiidae, especially of the genus Urbanus) that carry pollinaria on their eyes; the other three species are pollinated by Sphingidae. Habenaria johannensis is pollinated by the moths Manduca rustica and M.?sexta that carry the pollinaria at the base of the proboscis. Habenaria macronectar is pollinated by the moths Eumorpha labrusca and M. cf. lucetius, and these bear pollinaria between the palpi.

Scientific inventories for butterflies are often performed with a Pollard transect, a standardised surveying technique that generates high-quality data. General microhabitat surveys (GMSs) are potentially more appealing to amateurs participating in citizen science projects because they are less constrained. We compare estimates of butterfly species richness acquired by Pollard transects to those obtained by GMSs. We demonstrate that GMSs allow surveyors to detect more butterfly species and a more complete portrait of local butterfly assemblages for the same number of individuals captured.

However, endothelial cells also function in other capacities, including in immune regulation. Compared to the more traditional immune regulatory populations (Th1, Th2, Treg, etc.), endothelial cells have received far less credit as being immune regulators. Their regulatory capacity is multifaceted. They are critical in both limiting and facilitating the trafficking of various immune cell populations, including T cells and dendritic cells, out of the vasculature and into tissue. They also can be induced to stimulate immune reactivity or to be immune inhibitory. In each of these parameters (trafficking, immune stimulation and immune inhibition), their role can be physiological, whereby they have an active role in maintaining health. Alternatively, their role can be pathological, whereby they contribute to disease. In theory, endothelial cells are in an ideal location to recruit cells that can mediate immune reactivity to tumor tissue. Furthermore, they can activate the immune cells as they transmigrate across the endothelium into the tumor. However, what is seen is the absence of these protective effects of endothelial cells and, instead, the endothelial cells succumb to the defense mechanisms of the tumor, resulting in their acquisition of a tumor-protective role. To understand the immune regulatory potential of endothelial cells in protecting the host versus the tumor, it is useful to better understand the other circumstances in which endothelial cells modulate immune reactivities. Which of the multitude of immune regulatory roles that endothelial cells can take on seems to rely on the type of stimulus that they are encountering. It also depends on the extent to which they can be manipulated by potential dangers to succumb and contribute toward attack on the host. This review will explore the physiological and pathological roles of endothelial cells as they regulate immune trafficking, immune stimulation and immune inhibition in a variety of conditions and will then apply this information to their role in the tumor environment. Strategies to harness the immune regulatory potential of endothelial cells are starting to emerge in the non-tumor setting. Results from such efforts are expected to be applicable to being able to skew endothelial cells from having a tumor-protective role to a host-protective role.

High concentration and prolonged duration of local anesthetic administration are closely associated with severe lesions.SummaryPhenotypic analyses revealed that local anesthetics could induce histological damage with lesions ranging from local to extreme in skeletal muscle. Metabolic alterations were also described involving sarcoplasmic reticulum and calcium dysregulation, alteration of mitochondrial physiology and of oxidative phosphorylation with associated overproduction of harmful reactive oxygen species, typically leading to apoptosis or necrosis.Biochemical and cell biology investigations now indicate that local anesthetics interact with different molecular targets in mammalian cells as respiratory chain complex I or the prosurvival kinase Akt.

Acquisition of a synthetic, proproliferative phenotype by VSMCs following vascular insult is central to neointimal formation and the development of vascular pathology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are relatively recently discovered negative regulators of gene expression and act at the post-transcriptional level. MiRNAs have the potential to control VSMC phenotype. In this review, we discuss the recent findings on how miRNAs influence VSMC biology and acute vascular pathology.Recent findingsMiRNAs play an important role in the gene regulation by growth factors and downstream transcription factors involved in VSMC phenotypic control and deregulation. Recent studies have revealed miRNAs that are involved in VSMC regulation and further identified several target genes which are implicated in VSMC pathobiology, highlighting new disease mechanisms. Paracrine miRNA-regulated crosstalk between endothelial and VSMCs has also been demonstrated, revealing a novel mechanism through which vascular cells communicate in health and disease.SummaryMiRNAs appear to play a major role in the capability of VSMCs to phenotypically switch from a contractile to a synthetic state. Altering miRNA expression levels can prevent and even reverse the acquisition of VSMC synthetic phenotype in vivo and reduce neointimal formation, thereby implicating miRNAs as exciting future therapeutic targets for vascular proliferative disease.

Through signals delivered by its interaction with cell surface receptors, apoE has been shown to influence the polarity and inflammatory phenotypes of the macrophage. By promoting cellular cholesterol efflux in a cell autonomous manner and through its ability to enhance HDL function in hyperlipidemic plasma, apoE is now known to suppress atherosclerosis by controlling myeloid cell proliferation, monocyte activation and their capacity to infiltrate the vascular wall.

Many new technologies and applications are passing the translational phase and likely will soon be relevant for the clinical pediatric cardiologist.Recent findingsThis review will focus on two advances in basic science that are now translating into clinical trials. The first advance is the recognition, characterization, and recent therapeutic application of resident cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). Early results of adult trials and scattered case reports in pediatric patients support expanding CPC-based trials for end-stage heart failure in pediatric patients. The relative abundance of CPCs in the neonate and young child offers greater potential benefits in heart failure treatment than has been realized to date. The second advance is the technology of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which reprograms differentiated somatic cells to an undifferentiated embryonic-like state. When iPSCs are differentiated into cardiomyocytes, they model a patient's specific disease, test pharmaceuticals, and potentially provide an autologous source for cell-based therapy.SummaryThe therapeutic recruitment and/or replacement of CPCs has potential for enhancing cardiac repair and regeneration in children with heart failure. Use of iPSCs to model heart disease holds great potential to gain new insights into diagnosis, pathophysiology, and disease-specific management for genetic-based cardiovascular diseases that are prevalent in pediatric patients.

Boyle ?Molecular diagnosis on tissues and cells: how it affects training and will affect practice in the future On 25th November 2011, a symposium organized by the Royal College of Pathologists, entitled Molecular diagnosis on tissues and cells, took place in London. As trainees in histopathology and cytopathology, we were stimulated to consider the role that molecular biology is likely to play in future practice and how this is addressed by our own training. The symposium provided a basis for this article. Routine samples requiring molecular analysis are equally relevant to histopathologists and cytopathologists, and molecular biology laboratories are now using cytological as well as histological material for diagnostic testing, allowing different specimen types to be used as and when they are most appropriate. The most widely used types of molecular analysis in routine cellular pathology are EGFR testing in lung cancer, molecular testing of thyroid nodules, fluorescence in situ hybridization testing of urine samples, clonality analysis in lymphoma testing, HER2 testing in breast and gastric cancer, KRAS testing in colorectal cancer, intraoperative assessment of breast cancer sentinel nodes, molecular testing of gastrointestinal stromal tumours and mismatch repair protein analysis. Of these, the majority in the UK are carried out on histopathology samples, although many are applicable to cytological samples if adequate material is obtained. We are particularly encouraged by the potential of molecular diagnostic cytology in traditionally difficult areas, such as intraoperative assessment. We believe that increasing reliance on molecular diagnostic techniques will also herald changes in training.

However, the cell biology underlying how motile cilia produce coordinated flow and asymmetric signals is not well defined. In the zebrafish organ of asymmetry-called Kupffer's vesicle (KV)-ciliated cells are asymmetrically positioned along the anterior-posterior axis such that more cilia are placed in the anterior region. We previously demonstrated that Rho kinase 2b (Rock2b) is required for anteroposterior asymmetry and fluid flow in KV, but it remained unclear how the distribution of ciliated cells becomes asymmetric during KV development. Here, we identify a morphogenetic process we refer to as 'KV remodeling' that transforms initial symmetry in KV architecture into anteroposterior asymmetry. Live imaging of KV cells revealed region-specific cell shape changes that mediate tight packing of ciliated cells into the anterior pole. Mathematical modeling indicated that different interfacial tensions in anterior and posterior KV cells are involved in IN remodeling. Interfering with non-muscle myosin II (referred to as Myosin II) activity, which modulates cellular interfacial tensions and is regulated by Rock proteins, disrupted KV cell shape changes and the anteroposterior distribution of IN cilia. Similar defects were observed in Rock2b depleted embryos. Furthermore, inhibiting Myosin II at specific stages of KV development perturbed asymmetric flow and left-right asymmetry. These results indicate that regional cell shape changes control the development of anteroposterior asymmetry in KV, which is necessary to generate coordinated asymmetric fluid flow and left-right patterning of the embryo.

Although for some of the members important roles in immunology, neurology, as well as developmental biology have been suggested, most receptors have been poorly characterized. Results: We have studied evolution, expression, and function of an entire receptor group containing four uncharacterized aGPCR: Gpr110, Gpr111, Gpr115, and Gpr116. We show that the genomic loci of these four receptors are clustered tightly together in mouse and human genomes and that this cluster likely derives from a single common ancestor gene. Using transcriptional profiling on wild-type and knockout/LacZ reporter knockin mice strains, we have obtained detailed expression maps that show ubiquitous expression of Gpr116, co-expression of Gpr111 and Gpr115 in developing skin, and expression of Gpr110 in adult kidney. Loss of Gpr110, Gpr111, or Gpr115 function did not result in detectable defects, indicating that genes of this aGPCR group might function redundantly. Conclusions: The aGPCR cluster Gpr110, Gpr111, Gpr115, and Gpr116 developed from one common ancestor in vertebrates. Expression suggests a role in epithelia, and one can speculate about a possible redundant function of GPR111 and GPR115. Developmental Dynamics 241:15911602, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Med. 29, e377e381 (2012) Abstract Aims Skeletal muscle is a major metabolic organ and plays important roles in glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and insulin action. Muscle telomere length reflects the myocytes exposure to harmful environmental factors. Leukocyte telomere length is considered a marker of muscle telomere length and is used in epidemiologic studies to assess associations with ageing-related diseases where muscle physiology is important. However, the extent to which leucocyte and muscle telomere length are correlated is unknown, as are their relative correlations with glucose and insulin concentrations. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of these relationships. Methods Leucocyte and muscle telomere length were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in participants from the Malmo Exercise Intervention (n = 27) and the Prevalence, Prediction and Prevention of DiabetesBotnia studies (n = 31). Participants in both studies were free from Type 2 diabetes. We assessed the association between leucocyte telomere length, muscle telomere length and metabolic traits using Spearmen correlations and multivariate linear regression. BlandAltman analysis was used to assess agreement between leucocyte and muscle telomere length. Results In age-, study-, diabetes family history- and sex-adjusted models, leucocyte and muscle telomere length were positively correlated (r = 0.39, 95% CI 0.150.59). Leucocyte telomere length was inversely associated with 2-h glucose concentrations (r = -0.58, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.16), but there was no correlation between muscle telomere length and 2-h glucose concentrations (r = 0.05, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.46) or between leucocyte or muscle telomere length with other metabolic traits. Conclusions In summary, the current study supports the use of leucocyte telomere length as a proxy for muscle telomere length in epidemiological studies of Type 2 diabetes aetiology.

Dietary factors, lifestyle factors, obesity, variability in screening rates, socioeconomic differences, barriers to screening, and differences in access to health care may be contributory factors to racial and ethnic disparities. African Americans are more likely to demonstrate microsatellite instability in their colorectal tumors leading to malignancy. However, these differences do not completely explain all the variances. Ample evidence implicates insulin resistance and its associated conditions, including elevated insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), in colorectal carcinogenesis. African Americans have a high risk for and a high prevalence of insulin resistance and subsequent overt type 2 diabetes. Recent clinical studies revealed that ethnic differences between whites and African Americans in early diabetes-related conditions including hyperinsulinemia already exist during childhood. African Americans have a much higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency than whites throughout their life spans. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with higher rates of diabetes and colorectal cancer, particularly in individuals with high serum insulin and IGF-1 levels. Moreover, African Americans have lower insulin sensitivity in tissues, independent of obesity, fat distribution, and inflammation. Further development of measures of biomarkers of tumor biology and host susceptibility may provide further insight on risk stratification in African Americans.

Spatial autocorrelation (SAC), a pattern in which observations are related to one another by their geographic distance, is common in georeferenced ecological data. SAC in the residuals of SDMs violates the independent errors assumption required to justify the use of statistical models in modelling species distributions. The autologistic modelling approach accounts for SAC by including an additional term (the autocovariate) representing the similarity between the value of the response variable at a location and neighbouring locations. However, autologistic models have been found to introduce bias in the estimation of parameters describing the influence of explanatory variables on habitat occupancy. To address this problem we developed an extension to the autologistic approach by calculating the autocovariate on SAC in residuals (the RAC approach). Performance of the new approach was tested on simulated data with a known spatial structure and on strongly autocorrelated mangrove species distribution data collected in northern Australia. The RAC approach was implemented as generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models. We found that the BRT models with only environmental explanatory variables can account for some SAC, but applying the standard autologistic or RAC approaches further reduced SAC in model residuals and substantially improved model predictive performance. The RAC approach showed stronger inferential performance than the standard autologistic approach, as parameter estimates were more accurate and statistically significant variables were accurately identified. The new RAC approach presented here has the potential to account for spatial autocorrelation while maintaining strong predictive and inferential performance, and can be implemented across a range of modelling approaches.

However, it is unclear whether the expression of PPAR gamma in the islets is essential for their potential beta-cell-sparing properties. To investigate the in vivo effects of rosiglitazone on beta-cell biology, we used an inducible, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 enhancer element-driven, Cre recombinase to knockout PPAR gamma expression specifically in adult beta-cells (PPARgKO). Subjecting the PPARgKO mice to a chow diet led to virtually undetectable changes in glucose or insulin sensitivity, which was paralleled by minimal changes in islet gene expression. Similarly, challenging the mutant mice with a high-fat diet and treatment with rosiglitazone did not alter insulin sensitivity, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, islet size, or proliferation in the knockout mice despite PPAR gamma-dependent and -independent changes in islet gene expression. These data suggest that PPAR gamma expression in the beta-cells is unlikely to be directly essential for normal beta-cell function or the insulin-sensitizing actions of rosiglitazone.

Clinical trials investigating the therapeutic value of anti-IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) therapies in cancer, including prostate cancer, are ongoing. However, the multiple functions of the IGF network in the prostate are not entirely known. To elucidate the effects of IGF and insulin (INS) on prostate cells, we stimulated prostate cancer (PC3, DU145, LNCaP, DUCaP) and noncancerous prostate cells (EP156T, RWPE-1) and observed differing responses: whereas cancer cells responded to IGF and INS exposure by way of enhanced cell proliferation and glucose consumption, basal to luminal differentiation was induced in noncancerous cells. The same diverse responses were observed when the growth factor receptors IGF1R or INSR were overexpressed. Down-regulation of IGF1R or INSR isoform A (INSRA) also inhibited only proliferation of cancer cells. The proliferative response induced by the INSR in cancer cells was mediated solely by the INSRA. Moreover we observed that the receptors of the IGF network mutually influence their expression and exert redundant functions, thus underscoring the functional molecular network formed by IGF, INS, IGF1R, and INSR. Collectively we found that both IGF1R and INSRA have oncogenic effects in prostate cancer, but the IGF network also has important physiological functions in the noncancerous prostate. These data provide new insights into the biology of the IGF network in the prostate, thereby facilitating the design and interpretation of clinical studies investigating IGF1R targeting agents.

The dysregulation of estrogen metabolism has been associated with the susceptibility to obesity and diabetes. Here, we explore the role estrogen plays in sex differences in obesity and glucose metabolism, specifically adipocyte biology.We randomized C57BL/6 J male, non-ovariectomized female, ovariectomized female, and ovariectomized female mice supplemented with 17 beta estradiol to receive a calorie-restricted, low- or a high-fat diet (15 mice per group). We measured weight gained, calories consumed, percent body fat, abdominal adipose tissue, adipocyte size, lipogenic and adipogenic gene expression, and glucose tolerance.Male mice had a higher susceptibility to obesity than intact female mice. However, removal of the ovaries in female mice eliminated the protection to obesity and estrogen supplementation restored this protection. Male and ovariectomized female mice gained weight predominately in the form of abdominal adipose tissue possibly due to an increase in adipocyte size. Moreover, for mice consuming the high-fat diet, male and ovariectomized female mice had significantly higher levels of leptin mRNA and lower hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA relative to intact female mice and ovariectomized female mice supplemented with estrogen. Additionally, estrogen had a strong inhibitory effect on key adipogenic genes in non-ovariectomized female and ovx-female mice supplemented with estrogen. Finally, we show that male and ovariectomized female mice consuming the high-fat diet had a higher incidence of glucose intolerance.Estrogen protects female mice from obesity and impaired glucose tolerance possibly by modulating the expression of genes regulating adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis.

Exactly how human disturbances influence the behaviour of these species is still open to much debate. For example, little is known regarding how the colourful clothing often worn by tourists influences the behaviour of animals. Tourists wearing colourful clothing may be more conspicuous to local wildlife and thus cause more disturbances. We therefore investigated this question in female chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) in the Swiss Alps. We firstly investigated, via a morphological and an immunohistochemical approach, whether chamois are likely to have colour vision and would therefore be more likely to respond to different coloured clothing. We detected evidence of two cone types-short-wavelength-sensitive cones (S-cones, JH 455) and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones (M-cones, JH492) in the chamois retina-suggesting that chamois have dichromatic vision, similar to other ungulates. Secondly, via behavioural assays where a person wearing one of three coloured coats commonly worn by tourists (red, yellow and blue) approached a female chamois, we show that neither the alert and flight initiation distance nor the site of refuge were influenced by the raincoat colour. In addition, behavioural responses of the chamois were neither influenced by animal group size nor the presence of kids nor the time of the experiment. The results suggest that, although chamois possess colour vision, they do not react more strongly towards conspicuous colours worn by hikers. We discuss our results in light of what is already known about chamois biology and suggest implications for future studies.

They also have an unusual cell cycle control mechanism driven by constitutively active cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks). In mouse ESCs (mESCs). It is proposed that the rapid cell proliferation could be a necessary part of mechanisms that maintain mESC self-renewal and pluripotency, but this hypothesis is not in line with the finding in human ESCs (hESCs) that the length of the cell cycle is similar to differentiated cells. Therefore, whether rapid cell proliferation is essential for the maintenance of mESC state remains unclear. We provide insight into this uncertainty through chemical intervention of mESC cell cycle. We report here that inhibition of Cdks with olomoucine II can dramatically slow down cell proliferation of mESCs with concurrent down-regulation of cyclin A, B and E, and the activation of the Rb pathway. However, mESCs display can recover upon the removal of olomoucine II and are able to resume normal cell proliferation without losing self-renewal and pluripotency, as demonstrated by the expression of ESC markers, colony formation, embryoid body formation, and induced differentiation. We provide a mechanistic explanation for these observations by demonstrating that Oct4 and Nanog, two major transcription factors that play critical roles in the maintenance of ESC properties, are up-regulated via de novo protein synthesis when the cells are exposed to olomoucine II. Together, our data suggest that short-term inhibition of cell proliferation does not compromise the basic properties of mESCs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition to being chemically diverse, the bioactivity of an ethnobotanical can comprise from one to several bioactive compounds, present in a complex mixture. Conventional discovery efforts utilize bioassay-guided fractionation (BGF) to isolate individual active compounds. When applied to complex natural products, BGF is often challenged by an apparent loss of activity during fractionation, resulting in weakly active isolated compounds. Metabolomic analysis can potentially complement existing the BGF paradigm by capturing the chemical complexity of the metabolites. The proposed biochemometric approach establishes a link between the chemistry of a secondary metabolome and a deserved health impact, using a high-throughput, high-resolution capable biological endpoint. The proof of principle is demonstrated for the anti-tuberculosis (TB) activity of the Alaskan ethnobotanical, Oplopanax horridus. Biochemometric analysis identified the 100 most active constituents from thousands of metabolites in the active extract by means of 2D orthogonal chromatography using countercurrent and GC-MS methods. Previously isolated O. horridus phytoconstituents were used as reference markers of known structure and bio (in)activity. Positive correlations allowed distinction of anti-TB actives from inactive compounds. A total of 29 bioactives from 3 main structural classes were assigned based on MS data. Biochemometric analysis is a new tool for the standardization of herbal medicines and ethnobotanicals, as well as for drug discovery from nature.

In particular, beauty has been interpreted in terms of reproductive potential and advantage in selection of mates. We have reviewed the recent literature on female facial and physical beauty with the objective of defining which parameters could influence female attractiveness. Symmetry, averageness, and sexual dimorphism with regards to facial beauty, as well as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), breast size, and body mass index (BMI) for physical beauty, have been assessed. In current societies, it appears that facial attractiveness results from a mixture of symmetry and averageness of traits, high forehead and cheekbones, small nose and chin, full lips, thin eyebrows, and thick hair. A low WHR reliably characterized physical attractiveness, whereas inconsistencies have been observed in the evaluation of breast size and BMI. The importance of breast size appears to vary with time and sex of evaluators, whereas the impact of BMI is related to socio-economic conditions. The various hypotheses behind beauty and the role of attractiveness in mate choice and sexual selection are here described in terms of continuation of human species.

The existing molecular knowledge forms a firm backbone upon which hypotheses connecting genetic variation, transcriptional variation and phenotypic variation can be built. The sex determination pathway is a well-established molecular network, with the Yolk protein 1-3 (Yp) genes as the most downstream target. Our analyses reveal that genetic variation in expression for genes known to be upstream in the pathway explains variation in downstream targets.

The unlimited transcription (UT) model, in which transcription occurs permissively with a simple activation probability, has been proposed to investigate long-term effects of CNAs on gene expression values. Queueing theory was applied, and the copy-number-gene-expression relationship has been shown to be generally nonlinear in the UT model. However, the dynamic effects of CNAs on transcription and the underlying disorders related to diseases remain greatly unknown. Since most genes in a single cell are permissively transcribed in short periods of time interspersed by long periods of limited transcription, an alternative model for transcription in the restrictive state is needed for unraveling the effects of CNAs on gene expression levels with time. To address these issues, herein a single transcription (ST) model is proposed, in which bound TFs are assumed to be unloaded immediately after stimulating a transcription. Using the Laplace-Stieltjes transform and numerical analysis, the relationship between DNA copy number and gene expression level is evaluated. Dynamic modeling reveals that CNAs would potentially alter, or even reverse, the burst-like gene expression modifications while shifting from the ST model to the UT model. Moreover, functional disorders in transcriptional oscillation due to CNAs are shown via simulation.

While detecting the homology between two protein sequences is relatively inexpensive, detecting pairwise homology for a large number of protein sequences can become computationally prohibitive for modern inputs, often requiring millions of CPU hours.

The principally expressed keratins (K) of the intestinal epithelium are K8, K18 and K19. The specific keratin profile of a particular epithelium provides it with strength and integrity. In the colon, keratins have been shown to regulate electrolyte transport, likely by targeting ion transporters to their correct location in the colonocytes. Keratins are highly dynamic and are subject to post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation and glycosylation. These affect the filament dynamics and hence solubility of keratins and may contribute to protection against degradation. Keratin null mice (K8-/-) develop colitis, and abnormal keratin mutations have been shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Abnormal expression of K7 and K20 has been noted in colitis-associated dysplasia and cancers. In sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) may be useful in predicting tumour prognosis; a low K20 expression is noted in CRCs with high microsatellite instability; and keratins have been noted as dysregulated in peri-adenomatous fields. Caspase-cleaved fragment of K18 (M30) in the serum of patients with CRC has been used as a marker of cancer load and to assess response to therapy.

Angiotensin II (Ang II), as a key peptide of RAS, contributes to the contraction of human airway smooth muscle by activating the RhoA/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) signaling pathway. Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], is a component of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis which counteracts the detrimental effects of the ACE- Ang II-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis in vivo; however, whether Ang-(1-7) can inhibit the effect of Ang II in the contraction of human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) is unknown. In our study, collagen gel lattices and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the contraction of HASMCs induced by Ang II. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis were performed to confirm the regulatory mechanism and the participating signaling pathway. Ang II caused the contraction of HASMCs; this effect was reversed by Ang-(1-7). In addition, irbesartan and A779, which are inhibitors of AT1R and Mas, respectively, attenuated the effect of Ang 11 and Ang-(1-7). Furthermore, Y-27632, an inhibitor of ROCK2, attenuated the Ang II-induced contraction of HASMCs by blocking the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway which is involved in this contraction, and thus may be a major regulator involved in the basal maintenance of contractility in HASMCs. These data demonstrate that Ang II induces the contraction of HASMCs and that this effect can be reversed by Ang-(1-7), partially through the downregulation of of the RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathway.

Surgical performance is usually believed to be the most pertinent factor, followed by adjuvant oncological treatment and tumor histopathology. However: chromosomal instability is common in colorectal cancer and tumor clones are assumed to differ in aggressiveness and potential of causing local recurrence. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate if genetic alterations in primary rectal carcinoma are predictive of local recurrences. A large clinical database with linked bio-bank allowed for careful matching of two patient groups (R0) resected for rectal carcinoma. One group had developed early, isolated local recurrences and the other group seemed cured after 93 months follow-up. DNA from the primary tumors was analysed with array-CGH (comparative genomic hybridization) including 55,000 genomic probes. DNA from all primary tumors in both groups displayed previously reported and well-recognised DNA aberrations in colorectal carcinoma. Significant copy number gains were confirmed in the 4q31.1-31.22 region in DNA from tumors with subsequent local recurrence. Twenty-two affected genes in this region code for products with high relevance in tumor biology (p53 regulation, cell cycle activity, transcription). DNA from rectal carcinoma displayed well-known aberrations as described for colon carcinoma with no obvious prediction of local rectal recurrence. Gains in the 4q31.1-31.22 DNA region are highly potential for local recurrence despite R0 resection to be confirmed in larger patient materials.

The modular society of hamadryas baboons has previously been shown to consist of 4 levels: troop, band, clan, and one-male unit (OMU). A recent study by Hill et al. (Biology Letters 4:748-751, 2008) revealed a mean scaling ratio across successive levels of multilevel societies of ca. 3; this was consistent across elephants, orca, geladas, and hamadryas baboons. Here we reanalyze the scaling ratio for hamadryas baboons with previously unavailable data from Filoha. Our analysis revealed a mean scaling ratio for hamadryas of 3.28 without data on the hamadryas clan layer of organization at Filoha, but a ratio of 6.17 with these data included. This discrepancy is due to the large clan and band sizes at Filoha yielding a larger than average gap between the OMU and the clan. Further analysis revealed subsets of OMUs within clans, suggesting a 5th level of society in this population. When this 5th layer of social structure is included in the analysis, the scaling ratio at Filoha is consistent with that of other hamadryas populations and other taxa. These results suggest that a consistent mammalian scaling ratio can be used to detect previously hidden levels of organization within societies and to predict their sizes in taxa for which detailed behavioral data are not available.

Our study aims to develop a better understanding of the connections between student's achievement scores in mathematics and science, student gender, and self-efficacy. We used the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2007 eighth grade data to answer our research questions and were able to demonstrate that when controlling for self-efficacy, there is a statistically significant difference in the achievement scores between males and females by subject, where females score higher Algebra, but males score higher in the other mathematics subjects. Likewise, we were also able to demonstrate that there is a statistically significant difference in the achievement scores in Earth Science, Physics, and Biology, between males and females where males score higher in science subjects. In both mathematics and science examinations, we controlled for self-efficacy where in mathematics females hold lower self-efficacy then males and in science there is no difference between females and males in terms of self-efficacy. We conjecture that mathematics and science classrooms that consider self-efficacy may impact student's achievement scores by subject, which can ultimately impact career choices in mathematics- and science-based fields.

The histological lesion is stereotypic developing from the concurrence of a juxta-articular injury with an elevated calcium-phosphorus product. The reparative response to injury is histiocytic featuring synovial metaplasia forming bursa-like structures that create the characteristic compartmentalization of the lesion. Histiocytic-derived osteoclastogenesis occurs as a response to the calcifying process initiated in the mitochondria of necrotic histiocytes forming the bursa-like structures. These calcifications, propelled by a gamut of conditions elevating serum phosphorus, facilitate the further nucleation of hydroxyapatite in mitochondria, matrical lipidic debris located in the cytoplasm and lysosomes of osteoclasts and in the locular contents, and on collagen and other extracellular matrix materials. The lesions enlarge because of new locule formation and failure to reduce the calcified burden by the compartment lining histiocytes and dysmorphic osteoclasts that are unable to solubilize the hydroxyapatite. The histological landmarks of tumoral calcinosis may be lost when its development becomes quiescent. The classic calcifying classifications are inadequate for tumoral calcinosis requiring creation of a new category for this entity.

To address this omission, we tested a set of hypotheses about how the traits of climbers vary with latitude and climate and amongst major biogeographical regions of the world using a comprehensive new, global dataset. Location Global. Methods Data on seed mass, leaf size, specific leaf area, climbing mechanism, dispersal mode, and growth habit were compiled for 1092 species in 34 countries. For each trait we: (1) quantified the strength of latitudinal gradients using analyses across species and across evolutionary divergences, (2) examined underlying relationships between trait variation and climate variables, (3) tested for phylogenetic signal in traits (the tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar traits), and (4) compared trait variation and phylogenetic clustering between four major biogeographical regions of the world (Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia). Results We found highly significant relationships between latitude and four traits (growth habit, leaf size, seed mass and specific leaf area, SLA). Leaf size, seed mass and SLA also showed significant relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation. However, no relationship was found between dispersal mode and latitude or between climbing mechanism and latitude. These results were largely consistent in cross-species and phylogenetic analyses. All traits, except seed mass, exhibited clear differences between biogeographical regions. SLA and seed mass were the only two traits that did not present a significant phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic clustering was detected in species from the Americas and Africa, indicating that trait conservatism is important in broad biogeographical regions. Main conclusions The functional traits and phylogenetic patterns of climbers differ between biogeographical regions, and from other better-studied plant growth forms. Species-level trait differences may hold the key to understanding why climbers are increasing in abundance in some regions of the world, but not in others.

However, another framework is emerging based on recent scientific advances, one we suggest to call pharmacoempirics.

Determining osteoclast function is central to understanding bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteopetrosis. Here, we report a novel function of the F-actin binding and regulatory protein SWAP-70 in osteoclast biology. F-actin ring formation, cell morphology, and bone resorption are impaired in Swap-70-/- osteoclasts, whereas the expression of osteoclast differentiation markers induced in vitro by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-?B ligand (RANKL) remains unaffected. Swap-70-/- mice develop osteopetrosis with increased bone mass, abnormally dense bone, and impaired osteoclast function. Ectopic expression of SWAP-70 in Swap-70-/- osteoclasts in vitro rescues their deficiencies in bone resorption and F-actin ring formation. Rescue requires a functional pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, known to support membrane localization of SWAP-70, and the F-actin binding domain. Transplantation of SWAP-70proficient bone marrow into Swap-70-/- mice restores osteoclast resorption capacity in vivo. The identification of the role of SWAP-70 in promoting osteoclast function through modulating membrane-proximal F-actin rearrangements reveals a new pathway to control osteoclasts and bone homeostasis.

Many types of cardiovascular diseases are due to a loss of functional cardiomyocytes, which can result in irreversible cardiac failure. Since the adult human heart has limited regenerative potential, cardiac transplantation is still the only effective therapy to address this cardiomyocyte loss. However, drawbacks, such as immune rejection and insufficient donor availability, are limiting this last-resort solution. Recent developments in the stem cell biology field have improved the potential of cardiac regeneration. Improvements in reprogramming strategies of differentiated adult cells into induced pluripotent stem cells, together with increased efficiency of directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells toward cardiac myocytes, have brought cell-based heart muscle regeneration a few steps closer to the clinic.

Most effective treatments restore an embryonic phenotype to adult SCs. This has led to two emerging paradigms in SC biology: the application of developmental biology studies and the manipulation of the SC niche. Developmental studies can reveal how SCs are orchestrated to build organs, the understanding of which is important in order to instigate tissue repair in the adult. SC niche studies can reveal cues that maintain SC 'stemness' and how SCs may be released from the constraints of the niche to differentiate and repopulate a 'failing' organ. The haematopoietic system provides an exemplar whereby characterisation of the blood lineages during development and the bone marrow niche has resulted in therapeutics now routinely used in the clinic. Ischaemic heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and the question remains as to whether these principles can be applied to the heart, in order to exploit the potential of adult SCs for use in cardiovascular repair and regeneration.

It is imperative to develop effective therapies for the amelioration and prevention of HF. The search for the best cell type to be used in clinical protocols of cardiac regeneration is still on. That the adult mammalian heart harbors endogenous, multipotent cardiac stem/progenitor cells (eCSCs) and that cardiomyocytes are replaced throughout adulthood represent a paradigm shift in cardiovascular biology. The presence of eCSCs supports the view that the heart can repair itself if the eCSCs can be properly stimulated.

Here, we present evidence that the variable shrimp Palaemonetes varians shows genuine acclimation capacities of both the thermal limit (CTmax) and the heat shock response (hsp70 induction temperature). During cold acclimation to 10 A degrees C, the time lag to adjust the stress gene expression to the current environmental temperature proved to exceed 1 week, thereby highlighting the importance of long-term experiments in evaluating the species' acclimation capacities. Cold and warm-acclimated specimens of P. varians can mobilise the heat shock response (HSR) at temperatures above those experienced in nature, which suggests that the species is potentially capable of expanding its upper thermal range. The shrimp also survived acute heat shock well above its thermal limit without subsequent induction of the HSR, which is discussed with regard to thermal adaptations required for life in highly variable environments.

Dormant embryos are composed primarily of cells arrested in the G(1)/G(0) phase of the cell cycle based on flow cytometry analysis of DNA content. In fact, most cells in developing embryos contain only a diploid complement of DNA, with very few cells found in the S, G(2), or M phases of the cell cycle. Diapause II embryos appear to be in a G(0)-like state with low levels of cyclin D1 and p53. However, the active form of pAKT is high during diapause II. Exposure to anoxia causes an increase in cyclin D1 and p53 expression in diapause II embryos, suggesting a possible re-entry into the cell cycle. Post-diapause II embryos exposed to anoxia or anoxic preconditioning have stable levels of cyclin D1 and stable or reduced levels of p53. The amount of pAKT is severely reduced in 12 dpd embryos exposed to anoxia or anoxic preconditioning. This study is the first to evaluate cell cycle control in embryos of A. limnaeus during embryonic diapause and in response to anoxia and builds a foundation for future research on the role of cell cycle arrest in supporting vertebrate dormancy.

Although the genetic basis for the plate morph evolution of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is well described, the environmental variables that form the basis for different morphs are not understood. We measured the effects of dissolved calcium and salinity on the growth of sticklebacks with different plate morphs from Scotland and Poland. There was a significant interaction of calcium with plate morph for fish from both regions, with complete morph sticklebacks growing more slowly at low calcium concentrations and low morph sticklebacks showing divergent responses to calcium concentration. A Scottish anadromous population showed evidence of local adaptation to high salinity, which was independent of plate morph. Polish and Scottish populations diverged in their response to salinity, suggesting a difference in osmotic regulation. The results implicate a role for calcium in selecting for plate morph evolution in sticklebacks, possibly as a limiting element in skeletal growth.

One of the most prominent hypotheses, the Red Queen Hypothesis, claims that sex has evolved as a means to efficiently create genotypes that are resistant against coevolving parasites. However, previous models of the Red Queen have assumed that all individuals are equally likely to engage in sexual reproduction, regardless of their infection status, an assumption that may not be true in reality. Here, we consider a population genetic model of a host population coevolving with a parasite population, where the parasites are haploid and the hosts either haploid or diploid. We assume that the probability to engage in sex may be different in infected and uninfected hosts and ascertain the success of different reproductive strategies with a modifier-gene approach. Our model shows that in the large majority of the parameter space, infection-dependent sex is more successful than infection-independent sex. We identify at least two reasons for this: (i) an immediate short-term advantage of breaking-down gene combinations of unfit individuals and (ii) a selfish spread of the condition-dependent modifiers, in analogy to the abandon-ship effect in single species. In diploids, these effects are often powerful enough to overcome the detrimental effects of segregation. These results raise the intriguing question of why infection-induced sex is not more commonly observed in nature.

These issues have long been ignored in evolutionary biology, which might have led to flawed inference when addressing evolutionary questions. Hierarchical modelling (HM) has been proposed as a generic statistical framework to deal with complexity in ecological data and account for uncertainty. However, to date, HM has seldom been used to investigate evolutionary mechanisms possibly underlying observed patterns. Here, we contend the HM approach offers a relevant approach for the study of eco-evolutionary processes in the wild by confronting formal theories to empirical data through proper statistical inference. Studying eco-evolutionary processes requires considering the complete and often complex life histories of organisms. We show how this can be achieved by combining sequentially all life-history components and all available sources of information through HM. We demonstrate how eco-evolutionary processes may be poorly inferred or even missed without using the full potential of HM. As a case study, we use the Atlantic salmon and data on wild marked juveniles. We assess a reaction norm for migration and two potential trade-offs for survival. Overall, HM has a great potential to address evolutionary questions and investigate important processes that could not previously be assessed in laboratory or short time-scale studies.

Protein quantification methods based on the use of antibodies are very effective and widely used. However, over the last ten years, absolute protein quantification by mass spectrometry has attracted considerable interest, particularly for the study of systems biology and as part of biomarker development. This interest is mainly linked to the high multiplexing capacity of MS analysis, and to the availability of stable-isotope-labelled standards for quantification. This article describes the details of how to produce, control the quality and use a specific type of standard: Protein Standard Absolute Quantification (PSAQ (TM)) standards. These standards are whole isotopically labelled proteins, analogues of the proteins to be assayed. PSAQ standards can be added early during sample treatment, thus they can correct for protein losses during sample prefractionation and for incomplete sample digestion. Because of this, quantification of target proteins is very accurate and precise using these standards. To illustrate the advantages of the PSAQ method, and to contribute to the increase in its use, selected applications in the biomedical field are detailed here.

PNIPAAm-based films with controlled mechanical properties and different thicknesses (100-300 mu m thickness) were prepared by injection compression moulding at room temperature. A 9 x 9 array of 20 mu m diameter through-holes is machined by means of the KrF excimer laser on dry PNIPAAm films which are physically attached to flat polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrates. Machining parameters, such as fluence and number of shots, are optimized in order to achieve highly resolved features. Micro-structured freestanding films are then easily obtained after hydrogels are detached from PVC by gradually promoting the film swelling in ethanol. In the PNIPAAm water-swollen state, the machined holes' diameter approaches a slight larger value (30 mu m) according to the measured hydrogel swelling ratio. Thermo-responsive behaviour and through-hole tapering characterization are carried out by metrology measurements using an optical inverted and confocal microscope setup, respectively. After the temperature of freestanding films is raised above 32 degrees C, we observe that the shrinkage of the whole through-hole array occurs, thus reducing the holes' diameter to less than a half its original size (about 15 mu m) as a consequence of the film dehydration.

A distinct entity characterized by the t(1;22)(p13;q13) translocation, resulting in the RBM15-MKL1 fusion oncogene, has been recently recognized. This is predominantly a disease afflicting infants and displays characteristic clinical features. We present a case of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia with t(1;22)(p13;q13) along with a discussion of the current understanding of the molecular biology of RBM15-MKL1. This case also displayed striking and unusual morphologic appearances including extensive hemophagocytosis by leukemic blasts, which has not been previously reported for this particular type of leukemia.

We aimed adding knowledge on the clinical characteristics and outcome of metastatic (m) RCC in children and adolescents.Patients and Methods: The series included 14 stage 4 RCC patients with a median age at diagnosis of 155.5 months, observed at the Italian Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Association (AIEOP) centers from January 1973 to November 2010. We were able to reevaluate histopatology of 11 out of the 14 patients and perform immunostaining for TFE3 in 9 out of the 11 patients.Results: Of the 14 patients under study, 5 (3 girls) had a translocation morphology TFE+ RCC, 2 were reassigned as papillary type 1 or 2, respectively, 2 tumor specimens with primary clear cell histology had confirmed the initial histologic diagnosis, and 2-whose biopsy specimen was insufficient-had the diagnosis of RCC not further specified with subtyping. In the remaining 3 cases, the initial diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma was left. Overall, 6 patients received chemotherapy, 9 immunotherapy, and 2 adjuvant antiangiogenic therapy. Overall, 11 patients (78.5%) never achieved complete remission and died from progressive disease 1 to 16 months after diagnosis (median overall survival 5.5 mo). Three patients, 2 of whom received adjuvant antiangiogenic therapy, relapsed to lung at 3, 6, and 8 months after diagnosis, and died 18, 32, and 33 months after diagnosis, respectively.Conclusions: Despite their possibly different biology, childhood and adult mRCC seems to be sharing comparable outcomes. Because of the very low incidence of mRCC (about 20%) in children and adolescents, an international pediatric cooperation to address biological studies and assess the novel targeted approaches is needed.

In this study, tectoRNA was applied as a specific template for chemical peptide ligation. On the basis of a self-assembling tectoRNA, we designed and constructed a template RNA that facilitates peptide ligation depending on controlled dimer formation. Two RNA-binding peptides were recognized by two peptide-binding RNA motifs embedded in the template RNA, and chemical ligation was promoted because of the entropic effect of Mg2+-dependent dimerization. In a series of biochemical analyses, we determined the relationship between the structures of the tectoRNA-based templates and the extent of acceleration in peptide ligation.

This study investigated the effects of neodymium YAG laser treatment on pig skin, especially focusing on its extracellular matrix molecules. The dorsal areas of a minipig were subjected to laser treatment, and samples were obtained by punch biopsies, and histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses were performed. The laser treatment caused degeneration of collagen fibres and fibrils, which were reconstituted within 24 hours, whereas there was no inflammation and no apparent damage on elastic fibres. Small blood vessels disappeared by the laser treatment, which re-appeared in 3 days. Biochemically, the amounts of collagen decreased up to day 3 after the treatment and then increased at day 7. When fibroblasts in dermal tissue at day 28 were counted, more fibroblasts in the treated tissue were observed than non-treated control. These results suggest that, although the laser treatment transiently degenerates collagen fibres and fibrils, it restores and increases them, mainly by an increase in dermal fibroblasts, assuring its minimal complication of skin.

Alternatively, NO (3) (-) may be reduced by chemolithoautotrophic bacteria using sulfide as an electron donor. The aim of this study was to quantify the NO (3) (-) reduction process with sulfide oxidation under different NO (3) (-) input concentrations in river sediment.Under NO (3) (-) input concentrations of 0.2 to 30 mM, flow-through reactors filled with river sediment from the Pearl River, China, were used to measure the processes of potential NO (3) (-) reduction and sulfate (SO (4) (2-) ) production. Molecular biology analyses were conducted to study the microbial mechanisms involved.Simultaneous NO3 (-) removal and SO4 (2-) production were observed with the different NO (3) (-) concentrations in the sediment samples collected at different depths. Potentially, NO (3) (-) removal reached 72 to 91 % and SO (4) (2-) production rates ranged from 0.196 to 0.903 mM h(-1). The potential NO (3) (-) removal rates were linearly correlated to the NO (3) (-) input concentrations. While the SO (4) (2-) production process became stable, the NO (3) (-) reduction process was still a first-order reaction within the range of NO (3) (-) input concentrations. With low NO (3) (-) input concentrations, the NO (3) (-) removal was mainly through the pathway of dissimilatory NO (3) (-) reduction to NH (4) (+) , while with higher NO (3) (-) concentrations the NO (3) (-) removal was through the denitrification pathway.While most of NO (3) (-) in the sediment was reduced by denitrifying heterotrophs, sulfide-driven NO (3) (-) reduction accounted for up to 26 % of the total NO (3) (-) removal under lower NO (3) (-) concentrations. The vertical distributions of NO (3) (-) reduction and SO (4) (2-) production processes were different because of the variable bacterial communities with depth.

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare survival rates according to stages, adjusting for important prognostic factors. Methods: A retrospective study of a 17-year period from January 1994 to April 2011 was carried out. The cases studied were divided into two time period cohorts, those treated in the first 9-years (n = 109) and those treated in the last 7-years (n = 109). Results: An operation with curative intent was performed on 218 patients. The 5-year survival rates according to the depth of invasion were 86% (T1), 56% (T2), 45% (T3), and 5% (T4). The number of cases of incidental gallbladder cancer found during 3,919 laparoscopic cholecystectomies was 96 (2.4%). Incidental gallbladder cancer revealed a better survival rate (P = 0.003). latrogenic bile spillage was found in 20 perforations of the gallbladder during laparoscopic cholecystectomies, 16 preoperative percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainages and 16 percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainages; only. transhepatic biliary drainage patients showed a significantly lower survival rate than patients without iatrogenic bile spillage (P < 0.034). Chemoradiation appeared to improve overall survival (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis also revealed that time period, type of surgery, surgical margin, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node involvement, and chemoradiation therapy had significant effects.

Current imaging studies usually ignore intratumor variability in imaging biomarkers. We postulate that quantifying tumor heterogeneity with imaging techniques can provide useful information about cancer biology and potentially serve as novel imaging biomarkers. In this retrospective study, we identify a potential imaging marker, the microcirculatory fraction (MCFI), that quantifies tumor heterogeneity in normoxic/hypoxic cellular composition. We demonstrate its application on a test population of 22 women with stage II/III HER-2 negative breast cancer receiving antiangiogenic-cytotoxic combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Early change in MCFI, (Delta MCFI) is assessed with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging at the end of Cycle 2 and associated with pathologic response. Its performance is compared with other established volumetric imaging biomarkers (initial tumor volume and volume change) by statistical and graphic methods. We demonstrate that a significant (P<.01) difference in MCFI can be detected between good (median Delta MCFI 0.27) and poor (median Delta MCFI -0.12) responders, despite the limited population size. Differences in the volumetric biomarkers are not statistically significant. Receiver operating characteristic analysis also shows that Delta MCFI is a good predictor for pathologic response (AUC=0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.00, P<.01), while predictions made with the established volumetric biomarkers are not significantly better than random guesses. We conclude that Delta MCFI, has the potential of being a better predictive biomarker for therapeutic response assessment. Our findings support our postulation that quantifying tumor heterogeneity with imaging techniques can provide additional information that can serve as novel biomarkers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Monitoring the status of marine environments is traditionally based on macrofauna surveys, for which standardised methods have been established. Benthic foraminifera are also good indicators of environmental status because of their fast turnover rates, high degree of specialisation, and the preservation of dead assemblages in the fossil record. In spite of the growing interest in foraminiferal bio-monitoring during the last decades, no standardised methodology has been proposed until today. The aim of the FOraminiferal BIo-MOnitoring (FOBIMO) expert workshop, held in June 2011 at Fribourg, Switzerland, which assembled 37 scientists from 24 research groups and 13 countries, was to develop a suite of standard methods. This paper presents the main outcome of the workshop, a list of motivated recommendations with respect to sampling devices, sample storage, treatment, faunal analysis and documentation. Our recommendations fulfil the criteria imposed both by scientific rigour and by the practical limitations of routine studies. Hence, our aim is to standardise methodologies used in bio-monitoring only and not to limit the use of different methods in pure scientific studies. Unless otherwise stated, all recommendations concern living (stained) benthic foraminiferal assemblages. We have chosen to propose two types of recommendations. Mandatory recommendations have to be followed if a study wants to qualify as sound and compatible to the norms. The most important of these recommendations are the interval from 0 to 1 cm below the sediment surface has to be sampled, and an interface corer or box corer that keeps the sediment surface intact is to be used for offshore surveys. A grab sampler must not be deployed in soft sediments. Three replicate samples are to be taken and analysed separately. Samples are to be washed on a 63-mu m screen, and the living benthic foraminiferal fauna of the > 125 mu m fraction is to be analysed. Splits are to be picked and counted entirely, and all counted foraminifera from at least one replicate per station have to be stored in micropalaeontological slides. Census data, supplementary laboratory data and microslides have to be archived. Advisory recommendations are to sample in autumn, to have a sample size of 50 cm(2) or a tube of 8 cm inner diameter, to use > 70% ethanol as a preservative, rose Bengal at a concentration of 2 grams per litre for staining, and a staining time of at least 14 days. The split size should be defined by a target value of 300 specimens, heavy liquid separation should be avoided, and the 63-125 mu m fraction or deeper sediment levels may be considered in some environments. We are convinced that the application of this protocol by a large number of scientists is a necessary first step to a general acceptance of benthic foraminifera as a reliable tool in bio-monitoring studies.

Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally tropical insect that has spread to temperate regions and become cosmopolitan, offers a powerful opportunity for identifying the molecular polymorphisms underlying clinal adaptation. Here, we use genome-wide next-generation sequencing of DNA pools ('pool-seq') from three populations collected along the North American east coast to examine patterns of latitudinal differentiation. Comparing the genomes of these populations is particularly interesting since they exhibit clinal variation in a number of important life history traits. We find extensive latitudinal differentiation, with many of the most strongly differentiated genes involved in major functional pathways such as the insulin/TOR, ecdysone, torso, EGFR, TGF beta/BMP, JAK/STAT, immunity and circadian rhythm pathways. We observe particularly strong differentiation on chromosome 3R, especially within the cosmopolitan inversion In(3R)Payne, which contains a large number of clinally varying genes. While much of the differentiation might be driven by clinal differences in the frequency of In(3R)P, we also identify genes that are likely independent of this inversion. Our results provide genome-wide evidence consistent with pervasive spatially variable selection acting on numerous loci and pathways along the well-known North American cline, with many candidates implicated in life history regulation and exhibiting parallel differentiation along the previously investigated Australian cline.

Recently, it has been shown that the genetic distance of markers from functional loci can be an important factor to be considered in addition to marker numbers and variability. In this study, we investigated the correlation between individual heterozygosity and behaviour (aggression, boldness and feeding activity) in nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) individuals originating from four populations in two contrasting environments. Offspring of full-sib families raised in a common garden setting were assessed for behaviour and genotyped using 84 microsatellite markers that were either located within or near behaviourally or physiologically important genes (termed functional) or were randomly selected. No associations were detected with any behavioural trait in any population or over all populations when genetic variability was measured using all 84 markers combined. However, when the markers were separated into three functional categories (behavioural, physiological and random), several significant associations were observed both with functional markers and random markers in one of the four populations assessed. Interestingly, contrasting correlations with behaviour were observed when using physiological gene (negative) and random (positive) markers. Upon dividing the physiological gene markers into further subcategories based on their specific physiological functions, a strong relationship between the heterozygosity of markers linked to osmoregulation-related genes, and behaviour was revealed in the brackish water population. Our results indicate that both local (physiological) and general (neutral) effects are important in shaping behaviour and that heterozygositybehaviour correlations are population dependent.

We present a global probabilistic approach to annotate genome-scale metabolic networks that integrates sequence homology and context-based correlations under a single principled framework. The developed method for global biochemical reconstruction using sampling (GLOBUS) not only provides annotation probabilities for each functional assignment but also suggests likely alternative functions. GLOBUS is based on statistical Gibbs sampling of probable metabolic annotations and is able to make accurate functional assignments even in cases of remote sequence identity to known enzymes.

Coregulator dysfunction has been implicated in diverse pathological states, genetic syndromes and cancer. A hallmark of disease related to the disruption of normal coregulator function is the pleiotropic effect on animal physiology, which is frequently manifested as the dysregulation of metabolic and neurological systems. Coregulators have broad physiological and pathological functions that make them promising new drug targets for diseases such as hormone-dependent cancers. Advances in proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics have provided novel insights into the biology of coregulators at a system-wide level and will lead the way to a new understanding of how coregulators can be evaluated in the context of complex and multifaceted genetic factors, hormones, diet, the environment and stress.

Recent progress in understanding the biology of insect olfaction and taste offers new strategies for developing selective pest control agents. We have isolated two natural insecticidal molecules from edible roots of Decalepis hamiltonii named Decalesides I and II, which are novel trisaccharides, highly toxic to household insect pests and stored-product insects. We have experimentally shown that insecticidal activity requires contact with tarsi on the legs but is not toxic orally. The insecticidal activity of molecules is lost by hydrolysis, and various sugars modify toxic response, showing that the insecticidal activity is via gustatory sites on the tarsi. Selective toxicity to insects by virtue of their gustatory site of action and the mammalian safety of the new insecticides is inherent in their chemical structure with 1-4 or 1-1 alpha linkage that is easily hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes of mammals. Decalesides represent a new chemical class of natural insecticides with a unique mode of action targeting tarsal chemosensory/gustatory system of insects.

Components of the ubiquitinproteasome system 14 III. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation: a recurrent theme in the plant life cycle 18 IV. Conclusion and future prospects 25 Acknowledgements 25 References 25 Summary Ubiquitin is well established as a major modifier of signalling in eukaryotes. However, the extent to which plants rely on ubiquitin for regulating their lifecycle is only recently becoming apparent. This is underlined by the over-representation of genes encoding ubiquitin-metabolizing enzymes in Arabidopsis when compared with other model eukaryotes. The main characteristic of ubiquitination is the conjugation of ubiquitin onto lysine residues of acceptor proteins. In most cases the targeted protein is rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome, the major proteolysis machinery in eukaryotic cells. The ubiquitinproteasome system is responsible for removing most abnormal peptides and short-lived cellular regulators, which, in turn, control many processes. This allows cells to respond rapidly to intracellular signals and changing environmental conditions. This review maps out the roles of the components of the ubiquitinproteasome system with emphasis on areas where future research is urgently needed. We provide a flavour of the diverse aspects of plant lifecycle where the ubiquitinproteasome system is implicated.

In so doing, we also describe the evolutionary origins of the enzymes involved in glucosinolate synthesis. We use this model to address a long-standing question in plant evolutionary biology: whether or not apparently defensive compounds such as glucosinolates are metabolically costly to produce. We use flux balance analysis to estimate the flux through every metabolic reaction in the model both when glucosinolates are synthesized and when they are absent. As a result, we can compare the metabolic costs of cell synthesis with and without these compounds, as well as inferring which reactions have their flux altered by glucosinolate synthesis. We find that glucosinolate production can increase photosynthetic requirements by at least 15% and that this cost is specific to the suite of glucosinolates found in A. thaliana, with other combinations of glucosinolates being even more costly. These observations suggest that glucosinolates have evolved, and indeed likely continue to evolve, for herbivory defense, since only this interpretation explains the maintenance of such costly traits.

DCs are significant in maintaining immune tolerance towards self-antigens, organ transplantation and allergic responses. DCs are powerful adjuvants for eliciting T-cell immunity and are therefore considered primary targets for inducing immune responses in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and cancer. DCs have been increasingly applied in the immunotherapy of cancer worldwide during the last decade; however, a number of the highly specialized biological characteristics of DCs remain to be elucidated. Previous studies of human DCs have been constrained by certain difficulties, therefore the majority of studies have been carried out using in vitro model systems. Suitable cell lines with dendritic-like properties may provide valuable tools for the study of DC physiology and pathology. In the current review, various human DC line differentiation models are discussed. Certain cell lines provide valuable tools for studying the specific aspects of DC biology, despite variations in cell biological and immunological features when compared with primary DCs.

They are characterized by a histologic heterogeneity and a poor outcome. According to this rarity, few prospective data are available to date. No standard recommendations could be held for the use of systemic therapy in these tumors. Several case reports and small studies have investigated the contribution of different agents of chemotherapy. With the extension of molecular biology approach in oncology several signaling pathways have been discovered in different cancers including salivary gland cancers; thus a number of targeted therapies have been investigated.

In the present study, the morphology of the cercariae was analyzed using light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopies. The size of the larvae was larger than that reported in the literature. An oral sucker with many papillae and an oral aperture in its center and a ventral sucker with few discrete papillae on the edge were observed. No stylet at the anterior end of the larval body and spines on the tegument of the end of the tail were observed. The cercariae had lateral penetration glands and (central) pre-acetabular glands, from which ducts lead to the anterior region and open into a small anterior pocket. The flame cells were located laterally and communicated with fine branches, converging to two lateral excretory collecting ducts that opened into an excretory bladder, centrally located at the posterior end of the body. The tegument presented an external layer loosely attached to the larval body, below which an amorphous syncytial outer layer with many mitochondrial profiles was observed. This region exhibited many secretions and released secretory granules, indicating intense secretory activity. The circular and longitudinal muscle layers were arranged in sequence below the outer layer. The outer layer was connected by cytoplasmic bridges crossing the muscular layers to the internal region of the tegument, where the cell body with nucleus was located. In the cercarial body, it was possible to observe a typical flame cell with the barrel region, where cilia and the internal and external ribbed regions were found. The somatic cells seem to have an active metabolism, with a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum, secretory granules, and evident nuclei.

However, the mechanism of action of IMiDs is largely unknown. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of pivotal studies, recent advances in the application of IMiDs in cancer as well as their effects on hematopoietic stem cells including the risk of secondary malignancies. IMiDs have a well-established role as first-line therapy for patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Variant combinations of IMiDs with other chemotherapy reagents show promising outcomes in MM. Recent concerns on increased rate of secondary cancer in MM patients treated with maintenance lenalidomide were raised. But analysis of maintenance studies showed that the benefit of maintenance outweighs the risk of secondary cancers in MM. IMiDs also show efficacy in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and myelofibrosis (MF), but not in solid tumors. The major adverse effects are venous thromboembolism, neuropathy and cytopenias. IMiDs induce expansion and self-renewal of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and inhibit lineage maturation/differentiation by affecting critical transcription factors which might contribute to myelosuppression effect of IMiDs.

In this report, we explore the feasibility of determining total concentration of extracts containing chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b by chlorophyll fluorescence. We found that an excitation at 457 nm results in the same integrated fluorescence emission for a molecule of chlorophyll a and a molecule of chlorophyll b. The fluorescence yield induced by 457 nm is therefore proportional to total molar chlorophyll concentration. Based on this observation, we designed an instrument to determine total chlorophyll concentrations. A single light emitting diode (LED) is used to excite chlorophyll extracts. After passing through a long-pass filter, the fluorescence emission is assessed by a photodiode. We demonstrate that this instrument facilitates the determination of total chlorophyll concentrations. We further extended the functionality of the instrument by including LEDs emitting at 435 and 470 nm wavelengths, thereby preferentially exciting chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. This instrument can be used to determine chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b concentrations in a variety of organisms containing different ratios of chlorophylls. Monte-Carlo simulations are in agreement with experimental data such that a precise determination of chlorophyll concentrations in carotenoid-containing biological samples containing a concentration of less than 5 nmol/mL total chlorophyll can be achieved.

The construction of a plant-specific MS/MS data resource and database will enable complex phytochemical structures to be narrowed down to candidate structures. Therefore, a web-based database of MS/MS data pertaining to phytochemicals was developed and named ReSpect (RIKEN tandem mass spectral database). Of the 3595 metabolites in ReSpect, 76% were derived from 163 literature reports, whereas the rest was obtained from authentic standards. As a main web application of ReSpect, a fragment search was established based on only the m/z values of query data and records. The confidence levels of the annotations were managed using the MS/MS fragmentation association rule, which is an algorithm for discovering common fragmentations in MS/MS data. Using this data resource and database, a case study was conducted for the annotation of untargeted MS/MS data that were selected after quantitative trait locus analysis of the accessions (Gifu and Miyakojima) of a model legume Lotus japonicus.

During cold exposure, many carbohydrates accumulate and a new metabolic homeostasis evolves. In the present study, we analyse the diurnal dynamics of carbohydrate homeostasis before and after cold exposure in three natural accessions showing distinct cold acclimation capacity. Diurnal dynamics of soluble carbohydrates were found to be significantly different in cold-sensitive and cold-tolerant accessions. Although experimentally determined maximum turnover rates for sucrose phosphate synthase in cold-acclimated leaves were higher for cold-tolerant accessions, model simulations of diurnal carbohydrate dynamics revealed similar fluxes. This implied a significantly higher capacity for sucrose synthesis in cold-tolerant than cold-sensitive accessions. Based on this implication resulting from mathematical model simulation, a critical temperature for sucrose synthesis was calculated using the Arrhenius equation and experimentally validated in the cold-sensitive accession C24. At the critical temperature suggested by model simulation, an imbalance in photosynthetic carbon fixation ultimately resulting in oxidative stress was observed. It is therefore concluded that metabolic capacities at least in part determine the ability of accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana to cope with changes in environmental conditions.

Transcriptomic analyses were conducted with CATMA microarray technology on Arabidopsis thaliana plantlets, 2 and 26 h after exposure to the IR doses 10 Gy and 40 Gy. 10 Gy treatment seemed to enhance antioxidative compound biosynthetic pathways whereas the 40 Gy dose up-regulated ROS-scavenging enzyme genes. Transcriptomic data also highlighted a differential regulation of chloroplast constituent genes depending on the IR dose, 10 Gy stimulating and 40 Gy down-regulating. This probable 40 Gy decrease of photosynthesis could help for the limitation of ROS production and may be coupled with programmed cell death (PCD)/senescence phenomena. Comparisons with previous transcriptomic studies on plants exposed to a 100 Gy dose revealed 60 dose-dependent up-regulated genes, including notably cell cycle checkpoints to allow DNA repairing phenomena. Furthermore, the alteration of some cellular structure related gene expression corroborated a probable mitotic arrest after 40 Gy. Finally, numerous heat-shock protein and chaperonin genes, known to protect proteins against stress-dependent dysfunction, were up-regulated after IR exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

(1876-1956) on the 'Sexual habits of the Adelie penguin' was recently rediscovered at the Natural History Museum (NHM) at Tring. It was printed in 1915 but declined for publication with the official expedition reports. The account, based upon Levick's detailed field observations at Cape Adare (71 degrees 18'S, 170 degrees 09'E) during the course of the British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition 1910, commented on frequency of sexual activity, autoerotic behaviour, and seemingly aberrant behaviour of young unpaired males and females including necrophilia, sexual coercion, sexual and physical abuse of chicks, non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour.

Here, we sought to extend these studies by creating a new induced mutant strain with manipulated COX expression. We carried out gene targeting at the Ptgs1 locus to knock-in an expression cassette encoding COX-2 under Ptgs1 regulatory elements in a manner analogous used in COX-1 > COX-2 targeting. While successful gene targeting at the Ptgsl locus was achieved, the strategy did not yield a ""basal"" increase of COX-2 under Ptgsl gene regulatory control in various cells and tissues from COX-2>COX-1 mice but rather resulted in a Pigs) null allele. Possible explanations as to why this strategy was unsuccessful include non-functionality of the hybrid signal peptide and aberrant transcript processing. Since a similar strategy had previously worked (i.e. COX-1 cDNA knocked-in to the Ptgs2 locus; COX-1 > COX-2 mice) interpretations of our findings on murine COX biology and gene targeting are discussed.

From these data, ""Kleiber's 3/4 law"" was deduced, which states that metabolic activity scales as the three fourths-power of body mass. However, for reasons unknown so far, no such ""universal scaling law"" has been discovered for land plants (embryophytes). Here, we report that the metabolic rates of four different organs (cotyledons, cotyledonary hook, hypocotyl, and roots) of developing sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings grown in darkness (skotomorphogenesis) and in white light (photomorphogenesis) differ by a factor of 2 to 5 and are largely independent of light treatment. The organ-specific respiration rate (oxygen uptake per minute per gram of fresh mass) of the apical hook, which is composed of cells with densely packaged cytoplasm, is much higher than that of the hypocotyl, an organ that contains vacuolated cells. Data for cell length, cell density, and DNA content reveal that (1) hook opening in white light is caused by a stimulation of cell elongation on the inside of the curved organ, (2) respiration, cell density and DNA content are much higher in the hook than in the stem, and (3) organ-specific respiration rates and the DNA contents of tissues are statistically correlated. We conclude that, due to the heterogeneity of the plant body caused by the vacuolization of the cells, Kleiber's law, which was deduced using mammals as a model system, cannot be applied to embryophytes. In plants, this rule may reflect scaling phenomena at the level of the metabolically active protoplasmic contents of the cells.

While sequencing technology has made enormous advances over the past decade, there is growing interest in platforms that can readout genetic information directly from long single DNA molecules, with the ultimate goal of single-cell, single-genome analysis. Such a capability would obviate the need for ensemble averaging over heterogeneous cellular populations and eliminate uncertainties introduced by cloning and molecular amplification steps (thus enabling direct assessment of the genome in its native state). In this review, we will discuss how the information contained in genomic-length single DNA molecules can be accessed via physical confinement in nanochannels. Due to self-avoidance interactions, DNA molecules will stretch out when confined in nanochannels, creating a linear unscrolling of the genome along the channel for analysis. We will first review the fundamental physics of DNA nanochannel confinement-including the effect of varying ionic strength-and then discuss recent applications of these systems to genomic mapping. Apart from the intense biological interest in extracting linear sequence information from elongated DNA molecules, from a physics view these systems are fascinating as they enable probing of single-molecule conformation in environments with dimensions that intersect key physical length-scales in the 1 nm to 100 mu m range.

Experimental models have revealed that EMT also contributes to various malignant features of cancer cells, including motile, invasive, anti-apoptotic and stem-like phenotypes. Clinically, correlative studies have indicated that mesenchymal-like features of tumour cells are associated with poor tumour differentiation as well as worse patient prognosis. Nevertheless, due to its transitory nature, demonstration of an actual occurrence of EMT during human carcinogenesis is challenging, and most of the evidence to date has been limited to breast and colorectal cancers. However, recent studies suggest that EMT may occur during lung cancer development, although such evidence is still limited. We propose three approaches for obtaining direct evidence of EMT in human cancers and use these criteria to review the available data. We suggest that multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors cooperatively induce EMT in lung cancer. Intrinsic factors include oncogenic genetic changes such as mutant K-RAS. Extrinsic factors are associated with a tumour microenvironment that is inflammatory and hypoxic. The induction of EMT is primarily mediated by various EMT-inducing transcription factors that suppress E-cadherin expression, including SLUG and ZEB1. miR-200 family expression can reverse EMT by suppressing EMT- inducing transcription factors. Obviously, more data demonstrating the clinical relevance of EMT in lung cancer are required, and further elucidation of how EMT is regulated in lung cancer will enable us to develop novel therapeutics that specifically target molecules with critical roles in EMT.

This study retrospectively evaluated the US results from 113 consecutive cases of PTMC with 127 nodules and correlated the results with the histopathologic findings. The results showed none of the PTMC nodules had a cystic element. Half of the PTMC nodules had a well-defined boundary and the remaining half had an ill-defined boundary. A percent (6.3%) of the nodules had a halo sign. Microcalcification was present in approximately half of the PTMC nodules. The cancerous tissue with a papillary structure was hypoechogenic and the amount of fibrous stroma determined whether the nodule echogenicity was heterogeneous or homogeneous.

All patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer between January 2003 and July 2004 (and at least 5 years of follow-up) were selected retrospectively. After exclusions, 101 patients constituted our study population and were divided into isoechoic (or nonvisible) and hypoechoic (or visible) lesion. The clinical outcomes of these two groups were compared. The outcomes for the two groups were significantly different (p < 0.01). For nonvisible lesions, 37 of the 41 patients (90.2%) had no disease relapse and 2 (4.9%) had biochemical failure. For the visible lesions, 37 of the 60 (61.6%) patients were free of recurrence, 7 (11.7%) had systemic metastases and 10 (16.7%) died of complications related to prostate cancer. Our data show that patients with nonvisible prostate cancer had significantly better outcomes than patients with visible lesions during a five-year period of evaluation.

Therefore, finger flexion can be monitored from measurements of these morphologic changes. We used ultrasound imaging to record muscle activities during finger flexion and extracted features to discriminate different fingers' flexions using a support vector machine (SVM). Registration of ultrasound images before and after finger flexion was performed to generate a deformation field, from which angle features and wavelet-based features were extracted. The SVM was then used to classify the motions of different fingers. The experimental results showed that the overall mean recognition accuracy was 94.05% +/- 4.10%, with the highest for the thumb (97%) and the lowest for the ring finger (92%) and the mean F value was 0.94 +/- 0.02, indicating high accuracy and reliability of this method.

At present, there have only been a few studies that have been conducted to investigate this longitudinal movement. We propose here a method to assess noninvasively the wall bi-dimensional (two-dimensional [2-D], cross-sectional and longitudinal) motion and present an original approach that combines a robust speckle tracking scheme to guidance by minimal path contours segmentation. Our method is well suited to large clinical population studies as it does not necessitate strong imaging prerequisites. The aim of this study is to describe the association between the longitudinal displacement of the carotid arterial wall and cardiovascular risk factors, among which periodontal disease. Some 126 Indigenous Australians with periodontal disease, an emerging risk factor, and 27 healthy age-and sex-matched non-indigenous control subjects had high-resolution ultrasound scans of the common carotid artery. Carotid intima-media thickness and arterial wall 2-D motion were then assessed using our method in ultrasound B-mode sequences. Carotid longitudinal displacement was markedly lower in the periodontal disease group than the control group (geometric mean (IQR): 0.15 mm (0.13) vs. 0.42 mm (0.30), respectively; p < 0.0001), independent of cardiovascular risk factors, cross-sectional distensibility and carotid intima-media thickness (p < 0.0001). A multivariable model indicated that the strongest correlates of carotid longitudinal displacement in adults with periodontal disease were age (beta-coefficient -.235, p = .03), waist (beta-coefficient -.357,p = 0.001), and pulse pressure (beta-coefficient = .175, p = 0.07), independent of other cardiovascular risk factors, cross-sectional distensibility and pulse wave velocity. Carotid longitudinal displacement, estimated with our approach, is impaired in the periodontal disease group, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors and other noninvasive measures of arterial stiffness, and may represent an important marker of cardiovascular risk.

Previous studies have illustrated the feasibility of drug delivery across the BBB using focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles. Here, we investigated the effect of FUS-enhanced delivery of doxorubicin on survival in rats with and 9L gliosarcoma cells inoculated in the brain. Each rat received either: (1) no treatment (control; N = 11), (2) FUS only (N = 9), (3) IV liposomal doxorubicin (DOX only; N = 17), or (4) FUS with concurrent IV injections of liposomal doxorubicin (FUS+DOX; N = 20). Post-treatment by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that FUS+DOX reduced tumor growth compared with DOX only. Further, we observed a modest but significant increase in median survival time after a single treatment FUS+DOX treatment (p = 50.0007), whereas neither DOX nor FUS had any significant impact on survival on its own. These results suggest that combined ultrasound-mediated BBB disruption may significantly increase the antineoplastic efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin in the brain.

This study aimed to investigate the immediate effect of LIPUS at several intensities on cultured chondrocytes treated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) to induce an inflammatory response and on articular cartilage explants. Cultured chondrocytes and articular cartilage explants were treated by LIPUS at intensities of 0, 7.5, 30 and 120 mW/cm(2) or 0, 27 and 67 mW/cm(2), respectively. mRNA analysis revealed that LIPUS inhibited induction of MMP13 mRNA expression by 100 pg/mL IL-1 beta in cultured chondrocytes in an intensity-dependent manner. LIPUS also inhibited MMP13 and MMP1 mRNA expression in articular cartilage explants.

Ultrasound (US) has emerged as a technique to deliver mechanical stress; however, the intracellular signaling components of the mechanotransduction pathways that transmit the extracellular mechanical stimulus to gene regulatory mechanisms are not fully defined. We evaluated a possible integrin/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mechanotransduction pathway using Western blotting with antibodies targeting specific phosphorylation sites on intracellular signaling proteins. US stimulation of chondrocytes induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas), CrkII and extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk). Furthermore, pre-incubation with inhibitors of integrin receptors, Src and MAPK/Erk kinase (MEK) reduced US-induced Erk phosphorylation levels, indicating integrins and Src are upstream of Erk in an US-mediated mechanotransduction pathway. These findings suggest US signals through integrin receptors to the MAPK/Erk pathway via a mechanotransduction pathway involving FAK, Src, p130Cas and CrkII.

It maps the tissue elasticity or strain due to a mechanical deformation applied to it. The strain image most often calculated from the derivative of the local displacement field is highly noisy because of the de-correlation effect mainly due to unstable free-hand scanning and/or irregular tissue motion; consequently, improving the SNR of the strain image is still a challenging problem in this area. In this paper, a novel approach using the nearest-neighbor weighted least-squares is presented for direct estimation of the 'mean' axial strain for high quality strain imaging. Like other time/frequency domain reported schemes, the proposed method exploits the fact that the post-compression rf echo signal is a time-scaled and shifted replica of the pre-compression rf echo signal. However, the elegance of our technique is that it directly computes the mean strain without explicitly using any post filter and/or previous local displacement/strain estimates as is usually done in the conventional approaches. It is implemented in the short-time Fourier transform domain through a nearest-neighbor weighted least-squares-based Fourier spectrum equalization technique. As the local tissue strain is expected to maintain continuity with its neighbors, we show here that the mean strain at the interrogative window can be directly computed from the common stretching factor that minimizes a cost function derived from the exponentially weighted windowed pre- and post-compression rf echo segments in both the lateral and axial directions. The performance of our algorithm is verified for up to 8% applied strain using simulation and experimental phantom data and the results reveal that the SNR of the strain image can be significantly improved compared to other reported algorithms in the literature. The efficacy of the algorithm is also tested with in vivo breast data known to have malignant or benign masses from histology.

Since the ultrasound energy required to convert PFC droplets to microbubbles is inversely related to size, the conversion of PFC NDs at clinically-relevant pressures is challenging. We propose that if PFC NDs can accumulate in a close-packed configuration and grow in size in situ, phase-change conversion can occur at lower ultrasound pressures compared with isolated NDs. In this article, we show that PFC NDs can be designed to grow in size after loading in cells, from 0.26 +/- 0.09 mm to 1.7 +/- 0.6 mm after 2 h. This growth allowed for a substantial decrease in the ultrasound conversion threshold (to 1.4 MPa and 4.8 MPa at 1 MHz and 18 MHz, respectively), whereas non-coalesced NDs in cells and NDs alone were not converted up to the maximum applied pressure (2.1 MPa and 6.3 MPa at 1 MHz and 18 MHz, respectively). These results indicate that PFC NDs with conversion pressures too high for diagnostically feasible conversion can be used as phase-change agents if they can be induced to grow in size in situ.

This ability is dependent on nociception, the sensory process allowing animals to detect and avoid potentially harmful stimuli. Nociception is the sensory process that results in the subjective experience of pain in humans. Because of its vital and broad role in animal biology, pain/nociception is a complex, whole-body physiological process that is under stringent evolutionary pressure. Here, we discuss the utility of Drosophila melanogaster as an emerging model organism for studying the conserved genetics of nociception, particularly with respect to recently developed high-throughput Drosophila pain paradigms.

The identification of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from bone marrow by Friedenstein et al. dates back to 1970, but many questions remain unanswered about the biology of these cells. MSC have a wide clinical application because of their differentiation capacity and immunosuppressive properties. They are capable of self-renewal; however, the mechanism is poorly understood. The embryonic transcription factor Octamer binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) has been suggested as an indicator of multipotency for mouse MSC. OCT4 has also been studied extensively for its involvement in self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and in cancer cells. Methods. Using a lentiviral-inducible vector, we modulated OCT4 expression in human MSC and studied its effect on the biology of these cells. Results. Surprisingly, we found that the overexpression of OCT4 induced early senescence, as evidenced by increased expression of P14 and P16(INK4A) in MSC. Conclusions. These results indicate a differential role for exogenously expressed human OCT4 in adult and embryonic systems.

The aberrant function of the NEDD8 cascade within the context of malignancy makes it an attractive target for the development of novel anticancer agents. MLN4924 is a first-in-class inhibitor of the proximal regulator of the NEDD8 system (NEDD8-activating enzyme, NAE) that has entered Phase-I trials for cancer therapy and has established that significant therapeutic benefit can be achieved by antagonizing NEDD8-mediated protein degradation.Areas covered: This review provides a detailed overview of the NEDD8 system and discusses the mechanisms of action of MLN4924, a novel small molecule NAE inhibitor. Key findings from preclinical investigations of MLN4924 in a broad range of cancer models and preliminary findings from ongoing Phase-I clinical trials with MLN4924 are also discussed.Expert opinion: Targeting protein NEDDylation represents an exciting new anticancer strategy with demonstrable therapeutic benefit. Ongoing and future studies focused on dissecting the functional status/regulation of the NEDD8 system in individual tumor types will facilitate the design of novel approaches that yield optimal therapeutic benefit.

Numerous trials have failed to improve the outcome on this deadliest of all major cancers. Potential causes include a still insufficient understanding of key features of this cancer and imperfect preclinical models for identification of active agents and mechanisms of therapeutic responses and resistance. Modern genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC faithfully recapitulate the genetic and biological evolution of human PDAC, thereby providing a potentially powerful tool for addressing tumour biological issues as well as strategies for early detection and assessment of responses to therapeutic interventions. Here, the authors will discuss opportunities and challenges in the application of genetically engineered mouse models for translational approaches in pancreatic cancer and provide a non-exhaustive list of examples with already existing or future clinical relevance.

We investigate what role stage at diagnosis bears in international differences in ovarian cancer survival.Methods. Data from population-based cancer registries in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the UK were analysed for 20,073 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer during 2004-07. We compare the stage distribution between countries and estimate stage-specific one-year net survival and the excess hazard up to 18 months after diagnosis, using flexible parametric models on the log cumulative excess hazard scale.Results. One-year survival was 69% in the UK, 72% in Denmark and 74-75% elsewhere. In Denmark, 74% of patients were diagnosed with FIGO stages III-IV disease, compared to 60-70% elsewhere. International differences in survival were evident at each stage of disease; women in the UK had lower survival than in the other four countries for patients with FIGO stages III-IV disease (61.4% vs. 65.8-74.4%). International differences were widest for older women and for those with advanced stage or with no stage data.Conclusion. Differences in stage at diagnosis partly explain international variation in ovarian cancer survival, and a more adverse stage distribution contributes to comparatively low survival in Denmark. This could arise because of differences in tumour biology, staging procedures or diagnostic delay. Differences in survival also exist within each stage, as illustrated by lower survival for advanced disease in the UK, suggesting unequal access to optimal treatment. Population-based data on cancer survival by stage are vital for cancer surveillance, and global consensus is needed to make stage data in cancer registries more consistent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Human activities affect animals in four broad ways: (1) keeping animals, for example, on farms and as companions, (2) causing intentional harm to animals, for example through slaughter and hunting, (3) causing direct but unintended harm to animals, for example by cropping practices and vehicle collisions, and (4) harming animals indirectly by disturbing life-sustaining processes and balances of nature, for example by habitat destruction and climate change. The four types of activities raise different ethical concerns including suffering, injury, deprivation, and death (of individuals), decline of populations, disruption of ecological systems containing animals, and extinction of species. They also vary in features relevant to moral evaluation and decision-making; these include the number of animals affected, the duration of the effects, the likelihood of irreversible effects, and the degree to which the effects can be controlled. In some cases human actions can also provide benefits to animals such as shelter and health care. Four mid-level principles are proposed to make a plausible fit to the features of the four types of human activities and to address the major ethical concerns that arise. The principles are: (1) to provide good lives for the animals in our care, (2) to treat suffering with compassion, (3) to be mindful of unseen harm, and (4) to protect the life-sustaining processes and balances of nature. This ""practical"" approach arguably makes a better fit to the complex, real-life problems of animal ethics than the single foundational principles that have dominated much recent animal ethics philosophy.

Sialylated glycans are of special interest because the terminal position of sialic acid (NeuAc) in glycans linked by different ways to subterminal monosaccharides has been shown to be involved in several biological processes, as occurs with gangliosides, which have been reported as being essential in spermatogenesis in mammals. Some glycan-binding proteins, the lectins, which specifically recognize glycan sequences, have been extensively used to characterize tissue and cell carbohydrates by means of cytochemical techniques. The aim of the present work was to determine the presence of NeuAc by means of histochemical techniques in the testis of Xenopus laevis, an animal model widely used in cell and molecular biology research. However, considering that some NeuAc-binding lectins are capable of binding to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), other GlcNAc-binding lectins were also assayed. The results showed that NeuAc is mainly expressed in the interstitium, and only a weak labelling in the male germ cells was observed. Most NeuAc was located in O-linked oligosaccharides, but some masked NeuAc in N-glycans were identified in primary and secondary spermatogonia and spermatocytes. By contrast, GlcNAc was widely expressed in all germ cell types. Deglycosylative pre-treatments suggest that both N- and O-glycans and/or glycolipids could be responsible for this labelling. In addition, GlcNAc in O-linked oligosaccharides has been identified in spermatogonial cells. The acrosome of spermatids was always negative. Variations of glycan expression have been found in different cell types, suggesting that glycosylation is modified during spermatogenetic development.

Agardh, in its natural habitat is governed by abiotic and biotic factors such as temperature, light, nutrients, current velocity, and predators. Factors affecting the survival of the alga in an aquarium setting, however, have not been investigated. The National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA), in subtropical Taiwan, is the only aquarium in the world that displays giant kelp that does not have naturally occurring specimens in nearby waters. Giant kelp displayed in aquaria often deteriorates within a 3-month period, yet the cause of this mortality is unknown. We investigated abiotic and biotic parameters affecting survival of giant kelp in aquaria over a 3-month period. The results indicated that temperature, salinity, pH, light, and nutrient concentrations did not affect giant kelp survival. However, the massive proliferation of epiphytic diatoms on kelp blades (from 7 x 10(2) cells cm(-2) initially to 3 x 10(4) cells cm(-2) after 1 month) was identified as being the most likely candidate affecting survival of giant kelp in an aquarium setting. Potential factors that may stimulate epiphyte proliferation include lack of epiphytic algae control via predation, high nutrient concentrations, a weak current, and a generally stable environment.

In response to nitrogen starvation, some vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts, where fixation of N-2 takes place. Heterocysts provide a micro-oxic compartment to protect nitrogenase from the oxygen produced by the vegetative cells. Differentiation involves fundamental remodeling of the Gram-negative cell wall by deposition of a thick envelope and by formation of a neck-like structure at the contact site to the vegetative cells. Cell wall-hydrolyzing enzymes, like cell wall amidases, are involved in peptidoglycan maturation and turnover in unicellular bacteria. Recently, we showed that mutation of the amidase homologue amiC2 gene in Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 distorts filament morphology and function. Here, we present the functional characterization of two amiC paralogues from Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. The amiC1 (alr0092) mutant was not able to differentiate heterocysts or to grow diazotrophically, whereas the amiC2 (alr0093) mutant did not show an altered phenotype under standard growth conditions. In agreement, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies showed a lack of cell-cell communication only in the AmiC1 mutant. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged AmiC1 was able to complement the mutant phenotype to wild-type properties. The protein localized in the septal regions of newly dividing cells and at the neck region of differentiating heterocysts. Upon nitrogen step-down, no mature heterocysts were developed in spite of ongoing heterocyst-specific gene expression. These results show the dependence of heterocyst development on amidase function and highlight a pivotal but so far underestimated cellular process, the remodeling of peptidoglycan, for the biology of filamentous cyanobacteria.

In terms of attainable resolution, cryo electron tomographic reconstructions now show resolvable details in the 510 nm range, connecting optical microscopy with molecular imaging techniques. In view of the current developments in super-resolution light microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy, cryo electron tomography will be increasingly important in structural biology as a tool to bridge light microscopy with molecular imaging techniques like NMR, X-ray diffraction and single particle electron microscopy. In cell biology, one goal, often referred to as visual proteomics, is the molecular mapping of whole cells. To achieve this goal and link cryo electron tomography to these high-resolution techniques, increasing the attainable resolution to 25 nm is vital. Here, we provide an overview of technical factors that limit the resolution in cryo electron tomography and discuss how during data acquisition and image processing these can be optimized to attain the highest possible resolution.

Presence of CKD predisposes individuals to high risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Disordered phosphate homeostasis with elevated circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is an early and pervasive complication of CKD. CKD is likely the most common cause of chronically elevated FGF23 levels, and the clinical condition in which levels are most markedly elevated. Although increases in FGF23 levels help maintain serum phosphate in the normal range in CKD, prospective studies in populations of pre-dialysis CKD, incident and prevalent ESRD, and kidney transplant recipients demonstrate that elevated FGF23 levels are independently associated with progression of CKD and development of cardiovascular events and mortality. It was originally thought that these observations were driven by elevated FGF23 levels acting as a highly sensitive biomarker of toxicity due to phosphate. However, FGF23 itself has now been shown to mediate 'off-target,' direct, end-organ toxicity in the heart, which suggests that elevated FGF23 levels may be a novel mechanism of adverse outcomes in CKD. This report reviews recent advances in FGF23 biology relevant to CKD, the classical effects of FGF23 on mineral homeostasis, and the studies that established FGF23 excess as a biomarker and novel mechanism of cardiovascular disease. The report concludes with a critical review of the effects of different therapeutic strategies targeting FGF23 reduction and how these might be leveraged in a future randomized trial aimed at improving outcomes in CKD.

The aim of this study was to elucidate whether celecoxib may be able to affect epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process involved in cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis and then proposed to be relevant for cancer progression. Human HT-29 colon cancer cells were exposed to carefully controlled hypoxic conditions and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF) and then investigated for EMT changes and signal transduction pathways involved by using morphological, molecular, and cell biology techniques. Celecoxib inhibited basal and EGF-stimulated proliferation, hypoxia-related HIF-1a recruitment/stabilization as well as hypoxia- and EGF-dependent activation of ERK and PI3K. Interestingly, celecoxib prevented EMT-related changes, as shown by modifications of beta-catenin intracellular localization or vimentin and E-cadherin levels, as well as HT-29 invasiveness induced by hypoxia, EGF, or hypoxia plus EGF. Finally, experiments performed on SW-480 colon cancer cells (i.e., cells lacking COX-2) exposed to hypoxia, used here as a stimulus able to induce EMT and invasiveness, revealed that in these cells celecoxib was ineffective. Results of the present study indicate that celecoxib has the potential to negatively affect induction of EMT and increased invasiveness of colon cancer cells as elicited by different signals originating from tumor microenvironment (i.e., hypoxia and EGF). Moreover, these effects are likely be related to the pharmacological inhibitory effect exerted on COX-2 activity. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

His publications in physics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and the foundations of biology, are staggering in number, and include a massive 8-volume Treatise on Philosophy. The unifying thread of his scholarship is the constant and vigorous advancement of the Enlightenment Project, and criticism of cultural and academic movements that deny or devalue the core planks of the project: namely its naturalism, the search for truth, the universality of science, the value of rationality, and respect for individuals. At a time when specialisation is widely decried, and its deleterious effects on science, philosophy of science, educational research and science teaching are recognised, and at a time when 'grand narratives' are thought both undesirable and impossible-it is salutary to appraise the fruits of one person's pursuit of the 'Big' scientific and philosophical picture or grand narrative.

In this study, the reproductive tract of the Cardisoma guanhumi was described both macroscopically and microscopically. The maturation stages of the reproductive system were defined, and the development of germ cells was described. The reproductive tract is made up of a pair of testis, a pair of vas deferentia, and a pair of ejaculatory ducts. The germ cells were classified in the order of development as spermatogonia (diameter: 10.5 +/- 0.11 mu m), spermatocytes (9.7 +/- 0.07 mu m), spermatids (initial phase: 5.5 +/- 0.06 mu m; final phase: 4.3 +/- 0.05), and spermatozoa (SPZ) (4.0 +/- 0.03 mu m). The testis is made up of a germ zone, a maturation zone and collector ducts, which lead to the anterior vas deferens (AVD), containing solely SPZ.

Ovarian folliculogenesis in the southern sea lion Otaria flavescens. Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 93: 444452. In Otaria flavescens, folliculogenesis occurs within ovary cortex. This process attains successively higher level of organization through cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we identified eight major follicular stages from I to VIII, plus corpus luteum and corpus albicans. Otaria folliculogenesis is divided into (1) primordial follicle recruitment; (2) pre-antral follicle development; (3) growth of antral follicle; and (4) follicle atresia. The primordial follicle is surrounded by thin and flat granulosa cells. As recruitment occurs, granulosa cells organize into cuboidal monolayer marking the transition into pre-antral phase. Pre-antral phase (from stage I to stage V) is characterized by follicular growth and theca layer formation. The typical feature of the antral phase (from stage V to pre-ovulatory Graafian follicle or stage VIII) is the formation of a fluid-filled cavity (antrum) within the follicle. In the Graafian preovulatory follicle, theca cells organize two distinguishable layers surrounding the follicle. In gravid females, the corpus luteum persists. In nongravid females, the corpus luteum transforms into corpus albicans. The corpus albicans is formed by granulosa, thecal cells, and invading blood tissue.

There are several reasons for his lack of renown in the west, but mainly because his most important work ""The Biosphere"" was only fully translated into English in 1997. This book and the ideas it contains are now becoming regarded as one of the pioneering works of the last century. It defines the biosphere as a unifying, holistic concept for the earth system at a time when reductionism was the driving motivation in scientific research. Above all, for earth scientists, Vernadsky regarded life as the driving geological force. However another, as yet unpublished work (in three volumes) entitled ""The History of Natural Waters"" also deserves similar attention. This book explores many concepts in hydrogeology, geochemistry, geofluid circulation and especially biology in which water is described as an integral part of the biosphere.Vernadsky's teachers, including Mendeleev, Butlerov and Dokuchaev had a special influence on his early career path. He published prolifically in the 1920s and 1930s as well as founding several key institutions in Russia and Eastern Europe. The influence of the Russian school of landscape geochemistry, led by Dokuchaev also had a great influence on Vernadsky's scientific work and productivity, as was a period of study in France in the 1920s. The History of Natural Waters covers the spectrum of hydrogeochemical phenomena, in rather a descriptive way, yet its influence as the foundation of later ideas on hydrochemical processes and water-rock interaction, as well as hydrogeology, can easily be recognised. As well as including the role of biology in hydrogeochemistry, this work clearly emphasises the role of mans' influence on changing the chemistry of natural waters. Vernadsky adopted the concept of the 'Noosphere' (the evolution of human thought) to emphasis man's role as a geological agent. His publications foreshadow Gaia theory some half a century later.Vernadsky's works thus made a huge contribution to the development of many science areas and have changed the scientific world view; moreover they have defined the position of mankind in the evolution of the Earth and the biosphere and also put urgent questions for future generations with significance at the present time.

However, these fitness benefits are traded off against higher parasite load and increased virulence of temperature-sensitive pathogens. In thermally stratified habitats, behavioral plasticity can allow hosts to choose the optimal temperature to enhance individual fitness and to escape parasite pressure. To test this idea, we performed a temperature choice experiment with the host-parasite system of the sex-role reversed broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) and its bacterial pathogen Vibrio spp. In this species, pregnant males are expected to face a trade-off between shortening their brooding period in warm water and decreasing the effect of the infection in cold water. We found that exposure to Vibrio changed the temperature preference for both pregnant and nonpregnant males, as well as females compared to nonchallenged fish that tended to prefer warm water. This study shows that behavioral plasticity is one option for avoidance of higher bacterial prevalence, as expected due to rising ocean temperatures.

The serum copper (Cu)/zinc (Zn) ratios are sensitive diagnostic and prognostic indicators in oncology since Cu- and Zn-dependent enzymes play important roles in the genesis and the progression of tumors. The aim of this study was to examine the expressions of MMP-9 in tissues of CPTC and FPTC, as well as to determine the Cu/Zn ratios in the same samples. MMP-9 was determined immunohistochemically, and the concentrations of copper and zinc in thyroid tissue were determined by means of flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The results obtained revealed significantly higher expressions of MMP-9 in CPTC in comparison with FPTC, as well as higher Cu/Zn ratios in CPTC than in FPTC. Thus, determining MMP-9 activities and the Cu/Zn ratios could improve the accuracy of the standard histopathological diagnosis of these two types of PTC.

Although BMP2 is dispensable for bone formation, it is required for the initiation of bone repair: thus understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying bone regeneration driven by BMP2 is essential for improving bone graft therapies. In the present study, we assessed the role of Bmp2 in bone graft incorporation using mice in which Bmp2 has been removed from the limb prior to skeletal formation (Bmp2(ckO)). When autograft transplantations were performed in Bmp2(cKO) mice, callus formation and bone healing were absent. Transplantation of either a vital wild type (WT) bone graft into a Bmp2(ckO) host or a vital Bmp2(cKO) graft into a WT host also resulted in the inhibition of bone graft incorporation. Histological analyses of these transplants show that in the absence of BMP2, periosteal progenitors remain quiescent and healing is not initiated. When we analyzed the expression of Sox9, a marker of chondrogenesis, on the graft surface, we found it significantly reduced when BMP2 was absent in either the graft itself or the host, suggesting that local BMP2 levels drive periosteal cell condensation and subsequent callus cell differentiation. The lack of integrated healing in the absence of BMP2 was not due to the inability of periosteal cells to respond to BMP2. Healing was achieved when grafts were pre-soaked in rhBMP2 protein, indicating that periosteal progenitors remain responsive in the absence of BMP2. In contrast to the requirement for BMP2 in periosteal progenitor activation in vital bone grafts, we found that bone matrix-derived BMP2 does not significantly enhance bone graft incorporation. Taken together, our data show that BMP2 signaling is not essential for the maintenance of periosteal progenitors, but is required for the activation of these progenitors and their subsequent differentiation along the osteo-chondrogenic pathway. These results indicate that BMP2 will be among the signaling molecules whose presence will determine success or failure of new bone graft strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An understanding of the plant signaling pathways that respond to osmotic stress is important for both basic biology and agriculture. In this review, we summarize recent investigations concerning the SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK) 2 kinase family, which play central roles in osmotic stress responses. SnRK2s are activated by osmotic stress, and a mutant lacking SnRK2s is hypersensitive to osmotic stress. Many questions remain about the signaling pathway upstream and downstream of SnRK2s. Because some SnRK2s also functions in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway, which has recently been well clarified, study of SnRK2s in ABA signaling can provide clues regarding their roles in osmotic stress signaling.

As such the metabolic network of plants must be reconfigured under stress conditions in order to allow both the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis and the production of compounds that ameliorate the stress. The recent development and adoption of metabolomics and systems biology approaches enable us not only to gain a comprehensive overview, but also a detailed analysis of crucial components of the plant metabolic response to abiotic stresses. In this review we introduce the analytical methods used for plant metabolomics and describe their use in studies related to the metabolic response to water, temperature, light, nutrient limitation, ion and oxidative stresses. Both similarity and specificity of the metabolic responses against diverse abiotic stress are evaluated using data available in the literature. Classically discussed stress compounds such as proline, gamma-amino butyrate and polyamines are reviewed, and the widespread importance of branched chain amino acid metabolism under stress condition is discussed. Finally, where possible, mechanistic insights into metabolic regulatory processes are discussed.

Homology as a notion relevant to the recognition of clades remains equivalent to synapomorphy. Some symplesiomorphies are homologies inasmuch as they represent synapomorphies of more inclusive taxa; others are complementary character states that do not imply any shared evolutionary history among the taxa that exhibit the state. Undirected character-state change (as characters optimized on an unrooted tree) is a necessary but not sufficient test of homology, because the addition of a root may alter parsimonious reconstructions. Primary and secondary homology are defended as realistic representations of discovery procedures in comparative biology, recognizable even in Direct Optimization. The epistemological relationship between homology as evidence and common ancestry as explanation is again emphasized. An alternative definition of homology is proposed.

The present article aims at drawing attention to two areas of research that devoted considerable efforts to the understanding of social behaviour: ethology and social psychology. With a long tradition in the study of animal signals, ethology and evolutionary biology have developed theoretical concepts to account for the functional significance of signalling. For example, the consideration of divergent selective pressures responsible for the evolution of signalling and social cognition emphasized the importance of two classes of indicators: informative cues and communicative signals. Social psychology, on the other hand, investigates emotional expression and interpersonal relationships, with a focus on the mechanisms underlying the production and interpretation of social signals and cues. Based on the theoretical considerations developed in these two fields, we propose a model that integrates the processing of perceivable individual features (social signals and cues) with contextual information, and we suggest that output of computer-based processing systems should be derived in terms of functional significance rather than in terms of absolute conceptual meaning.

Such indicators may fail to identify that a population or species meets criteria for conservation action (false negative) or may incorrectly show that such criteria have been met (false positive). To quantify the rate of both types of error for 20 commonly used indicators of declining abundance (threat indicators), we used receiver operating characteristic curves derived from historical (19382007) data for 18 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations in the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. We retrospectively determined each population's yearly status (reflected by change in abundance over time) on the basis of each indicator. We then compared that population's status in a given year with the status in subsequent years (determined by the magnitude of decline in abundance across those years). For each sockeye population, we calculated how often each indicator of past status matched subsequent status. No single threat indicator provided error-free estimates of status, but indicators that reflected the extent (i.e., magnitude) of past decline in abundance (through comparison of current abundance with some historical baseline abundance) tended to better reflect status in subsequent years than the rate of decline over the previous 3 generations (a widely used indicator). We recommend that when possible, the reliability of various threat indicators be evaluated with empirical analyses before such indicators are used to determine the need for conservation action. These indicators should include estimates from the entire data set to take into account a historical baseline.

Island endemic species often lack life-history traits and behaviors that reduce the probability of predation and they can become evolutionarily trapped if they are unable to adapt, but few studies have examined the ability of island species to respond to novel predators. The greatest threat to the persistence of the Oahu Elepaio (Chasiempis ibidis), an endangered Hawaiian forest bird, is nest predation by non-native black rats (Rattus rattus). I examined whether Oahu Elepaio nest placement has changed at the individual and population levels in response to rat predation by measuring nest height and determining whether each nest produced offspring from 1996 to 2011. Average height of Oahu Elepaio nests increased 50% over this 16-year period, from 7.9 m (SE 1.7) to 12.0 m (SE 1.1). There was no net change in height of sequential nests made by individual birds, which means individual elepaios have not learned to place nests higher. Nests =3 m off the ground produced offspring less often, and the proportion of such nests declined over time, which suggests that nest-building behavior has evolved through natural selection by predation. Nest success increased over time, which may increase the probability of long-term persistence of the species. Rat control may facilitate the evolution of nesting height by slowing the rate of population decline and providing time for this adaptive response to spread through the population.

This article reviews the biology of stem cells and their applications as a cell-based treatment for SUI. The current status and future direction of this forefront research in urinary incontinence are also examined.Recent findingsDuring the past decade, adult stem cells have been studied as a potential cell-based approach for the treatment of SUI. The results of current preclinical and clinical studies are presented. These studies demonstrated the improvement in histologic and functional outcomes with stem cell therapies for SUI. Adult stem cells may augment sphincter regeneration and also release trophic factors, promoting vessel and nerve integration into the generated tissues. So far, the findings of the clinical trials are less impressive than the results obtained with animal studies.SummaryAlthough stem cell therapy holds much promise for SUI, the clinical applications in patients have been slow to materialize. This challenge, together with the currently limited data on basic science studies and clinical trials, will undoubtedly stimulate new investigations in the near future.

In this study, we compared the different abilities of spleen cells to survive and differentiate in vivo after permeabilization by five different types of egg extracts. Five types of egg extracts were prepared. The spleen cells from male GFP-transgenic mice were permeabilized by the extracts for 30 min, cultured for 12 days, and then transfused into irradiated female mice. At varying days after transplantation, the percentage of GFP-expressing surviving spleen cells was detected in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry. At 120 days after transplantation, bone marrow cells from the female mice were analyzed for the presence of cells containing the Y chromosome. Surviving GFP-positive spleen cells that had been permeabilized with either chicken-egg-white or whole-egg extracts could be detected in the female mice after transplantation. A lower percentage of GFP-positive cells was also detected after permeabilization by the other extracts tested, and no GFP-positive cells were found in the female mouse transfused with spleen cells permeabilized with Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) as a control. At 120 days after transplantation, the percentage of cells containing a Y chromosome in the bone marrow positively correlated with the percentage of GFP-positive cells in the peripheral blood. After permeabilization by chicken-egg-white or whole-egg extracts, spleen cells demonstrated significantly enhanced survival and differentiation functions compared with the spleen cells treated with the other egg extracts tested. These results show that chicken-egg-white and whole-egg extracts have roles in maintaining and enhancing the survival and differentiation of spleen cells. Therefore, these two types of extracts may be of future use in maintaining the function of stem cells.

Mobilization of stem cells out of their niches followed by correct migration and differentiation at a site of tissue turnover or injury are important requirements for proper tissue maintenance and regeneration. However, we understand little about the mechanisms that control this process, possibly because the best studied vertebrate adult stem cell systems are not readily amenable to in vivo observation. Furthermore, few clear examples of the recruitment of fully potent stem cells, compared with limited progenitors, are known. Here, we show that planarian stem cells directionally migrate to amputation sites during regeneration. We also show that during tissue homeostasis they are stationary. Our study not only uncovers the existence of specific recruitment mechanisms elicited by amputation, but also sets the stage for the systematic characterization of evolutionarily conserved stem cell regulatory processes likely to inform stem cell function and dysfunction in higher organisms, including humans.

However, few landscape genetics studies have quantified the relationships between landscape variables and effective population size (Ne), although Ne is a key conservation and population genetics parameter. In this study, I estimated genetic structure and effective population sizes in the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and tested for associations with environmental and geographic variables. Location Yosemite National Park, California, USA. Methods I estimated FST, Dps and Ne using 10 microsatellite loci amplified from 781 individuals from 24 populations. I used three landscape variables (environmental variation, topography and slope) to generate geographic distance models and a series of regression analyses to identify the variables that contributed to genetic structure in this species. I also tested for correlations between Ne and a suite of variables, including geographic and genetic isolation, habitat suitability, elevation, temperature and precipitation. Results I found substantial variation in genetic distances between populations (FST = 0.0040.396, Dps = 0.0450.839) and in effective population sizes (Ne = 952). Environmental variation and slope played important roles in explaining variation in genetic distances, and precipitation variables were significantly correlated with Ne. Main conclusions These results show that environmental and topographic variables are both important for understanding population connectivity in B.similar to canorus and provide some of the first evidence, in any species, for a link between environmental variables and effective population size.

Hypotheses for the differences observed in dispersal abilities between species include the variation in pelagic larval duration (PLD). However, the implication of the PLD as a proxy for explaining the dispersal ability of a species is not clear in the Sicydiinae subfamily. In this study, otolith microstructure of three Sicydiinae species was analysed. One of these species, Sicyopus zosterophorum, has a widespread distribution in the West Pacific area, whereas the other two species, Smilosicyopus chloe and Akihito vanuatu, are endemic to New Caledonia and to Vanuatu, respectively. Deposition of the daily growth increments on the otoliths of S. zosterophorum was validated using an alizarin complexone time marking technique. We estimated the PLD for the three species by counting the number of growth increments from the core to the metamorphosis check mark, and it was shorter than the one of previous studies on Sicydiinae species. The PLD of the widespread species, S. zosterophorum (54.6 +/- 5.6 days), was similar to those of the endemic species, S. chloe (53.6 +/- 5.7 days) and A. vanuatu (55.4 +/- 7.5 days). Here, we show that in contrast to the most diverse Sicydiinae genus, Sicyopterus, the PLD could not explain endemism, and we must take into account other elements to explain the differences observed in the distribution range.

New family units exist today whose impact on society needs to be explored.Methods For each main area researched (anthropology, biology, sociology, sexology, ethics) we identified articles dealing with family formation, sexuality and reproduction using PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google, religious websites and texts.Results The three monotheistic religions and the cultures derived from these have considered sexuality as focused on reproduction. Presently, sexuality has acquired new dimensions, independent from reproduction, as contraception and IVF have separated procreation and sexuality. Thus, the very concept of family has been expanded and so-called 'unusual families' have proved not to be a danger per se for children born and raised within them.Conclusions Human sexuality has moved away from having a purely reproductive function, but remains a powerful bond keeping families together, irrespective of the gender identity and the biological links of their members. Even among traditional societies, different types of families exist and the situation has become more complex as technical developments have made parenthood possible for people who in the past were excluded from it.

Determining the annual brood number is especially relevant for species that are actively fished. Herein we combined different approaches to estimate the annual brood number of two commercially exploited species of squat lobsters from the Chilean continental shelf and upper slope. Cervimunida johni and Pleuroncodes monodon. Long-term maintenance in the laboratory revealed that most females (>70%) produced 3 or more broods during the annual reproductive season. Incubation of individual broods required about 40 days, which would allow for 3 subsequent broods during the main reproductive period (June-September). The dynamics of brood release of ovigerous females that were collected from the field at approximately monthly intervals supported the estimate of 3-4 annual broods for adult females. Furthermore, these latter data also indicated a high degree of breeding synchrony among reproductive females. It is suggested that the production of successive broods might be an adaption to the variable oceanographic conditions during the reproductive period, ensuring that at least one larval cohort finds favorable conditions for development and settlement. Based on these results it is recommended that fishing effort is reduced during the main reproductive period of the two squat lobsters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

S. graduate programs in physics and biology (n = 2,503) and semistructured interviews with 150 of them, this article examines the reasons academic scientists provide for differences in the distribution of women in biology and physics. In quantitative analyses, gender is more salient than discipline in determining the reasons scientists provide for gender disparities between disciplines, suggesting that gender may act as a ""master status,"" shaping the experiences of scientists regardless of the gender composition of the discipline. Qualitative interviews confirm this interpretation and reveal that scientists also perceive mentoring, natural differences, discrimination, and the history of the disciplines to be important factors.

To understand the invasion process of exotic forest pests in South Korea, we reviewed four major species of exotic forest pests: the pine needle gall midge (Thecodiplosis japonensis), pine wilt disease caused by the pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) and the black pine bast scale (Matsucoccus thunbergianae). We consider their biology, ecology, invasion history, dispersal patterns and related traits, and management as exotic species. Among these species, the dispersal process of fall webworm was linear, showing a constant range expansion as a function of time, whereas the other three species showed biphasic patterns, rapidly increasing dispersal speed after slow dispersal at the early invasion stage. Moreover, human activities accelerated their expansion, suggesting that prevention of the artificial movement of damaged trees would be useful to slow expansion of exotic species. We believe that this information would be useful to establish management strategies for invasion species.

It has long been known that the endosymbiotic algae transfer much of their photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host and that this can provide much of the host's total energy. However, it has remained unclear which metabolite(s) are directly translocated from the algae into the host tissue. We reexamined this question in the small sea anemone Aiptasia using labeling of intact animals in the light with C-13-bicarbonate, rapid homogenization and separation of animal and algal fractions, and analysis of metabolite labeling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found labeled glucose in the animal fraction within 2 min of exposure to C-13-bicarbonate, whereas no significant labeling of other compounds was observed within the first 10 min. Although considerable previous evidence has suggested that glycerol might be a major translocated metabolite, we saw no significant labeling of glycerol within the first hour, and incubation of intact animals with C-13-labeled glycerol did not result in a rapid production of C-13-glucose. In contrast, when Symbiodinium cells freshly isolated from host tissue were exposed to light and C-13-bicarbonate in the presence of host homogenate, labeled glycerol, but not glucose, was detected in the medium. We also observed early production of labeled glucose, but not glycerol, in three coral species. Taken together, the results suggest that glucose is the major translocated metabolite in dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbiosis and that the release of glycerol from isolated algae may be part of a stress response.

Subjects were prospectively recruited for genotype (Glu298, n = 30 and Asp298, n = 29; balanced for age and gender) consumed SFA on two occasions, with and without the substitution of 0.07 g fat/kg body weight with LC n-3 PUFA, and with heparin infusion to elevate NEFA. Endothelial function was measured before and after NEFA elevation (240 min), with blood samples taken every 30 min. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) decreased following SFA alone and increased following SFA+LC n-3 PUFA. There were 2-fold differences in the change in FMD response to the different fat loads between the Asp298 and Glu298 genotypes (P = 0.002) and between genders (P < 0.02). Sodium nitroprusside-induced reactivity, measured by laser Doppler imaging with iontophoresis, was significantly greater with SFA+LC n-3 PUFA in all female subjects (P < 0.001) but not in males.

Epigenetic alterations are dynamic lesions that change over the natural course of the disease, and so they might play a role in the biology of cancer cells that have departed from the primary tumour. Herein, we have adopted an epigenomic approach to identify some of these changes. Using a DNA methylation microarray platform to compare paired primary tumour and lymph node metastatic cell lines from the same patient, we observed cadherin-11 promoter CpG island hypermethylation as a likely target of the process. We found that CDH11 DNA methylation-associated transcriptional silencing occurred in the corresponding lymph node metastases of melanoma and head and neck cancer cells but not in the primary tumours. Using in vitro and in vivo cellular and mouse models for depleted or enhanced CDH11 activity, we also demonstrated that CDH11 acts as an inhibitor of tumour growth, motility and dissemination. Most importantly, the study of CDH11 5'-CpG island hypermethylation in primary tumours and lymph node metastases of cancer patients showed this epigenetic alteration to be significantly confined to the disseminated cells. Overall, these results indicate the existence of metastasis-specific epigenetic events that might contribute to the progression of the disease.

The renewed interest in the NET problem is due to its relevance in molecular biology and biophysics. The small window often represents a small target on a cellular membrane, such as a protein channel, which is a target for ions, a receptor for neurotransmitter molecules in a neuronal synapse, a narrow neck in the neuronal spine, which is a target for calcium ions, and so on. The leading order singularity of the Neumann function for a regular domain strongly depends on the geometric properties of the boundary. It can give a smaller contribution than the regular part to the absorption flux through the small window when it is located near a boundary cusp. We review here recent results on the dependence of the absorption flux on the geometric properties of the domain and thus reveal geometrical features that can modulate the flux.

The definition of index lesion volume is important for appropriate decision making, especially for image guided focal treatment. We determined the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging for determining index tumor volume compared with volumes derived from histopathology.Materials and Methods: We evaluated 135 patients (mean age 59.3 years) with a mean prostate specific antigen of 6.74 ng/dl who underwent multiparametric 3T endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and subsequent radical prostatectomy. Index tumor volume was determined prospectively and independently by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology. The ellipsoid formula was applied to determine histopathology tumor volume, whereas manual tumor segmentation was used to determine magnetic resonance tumor volume. Histopathology tumor volume was correlated with age and prostate specific antigen whereas magnetic resonance tumor volume involved Pearson correlation and linear regression methods. In addition, the predictive power of magnetic resonance tumor volume, prostate specific antigen and age for estimating histopathology tumor volume (greater than 0.5 cm(3)) was assessed by ROC analysis. The same analysis was also conducted for the 1.15 shrinkage factor corrected histopathology data set.Results: There was a positive correlation between histopathology tumor volume and magnetic resonance tumor volume (Pearson coefficient 0.633, p <0.0001), but a weak correlation between prostate specific antigen and histopathology tumor volume (Pearson coefficient 0.237, p = 0.003). On linear regression analysis histopathology tumor volume and magnetic resonance tumor volume were correlated (r(2) = 0.401, p <0.00001). On ROC analysis AUC values for magnetic resonance tumor volume, prostate specific antigen and age in estimating tumors larger than 0.5 cm(3) at histopathology were 0.949 (p <0.0000001), 0.685 (p = 0.001) and 0.627 (p = 0.02), respectively. Similar results were found in the analysis with shrinkage factor corrected tumor volumes at histopathology.Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging can accurately estimate index tumor volume as determined by histology. Magnetic resonance imaging has better accuracy in predicting histopathology tumor volume in tumors larger than 0.5 cm(3) than prostate specific antigen and age. Index tumor volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in planning treatment, specifically in identifying tumor margins for image guided focal therapy and possibly selecting better active surveillance candidates.

Similar to the case for most DNA viruses, after receptor binding and entry, AAV traverses the cytoplasm and deposits the viral genome in the cell nucleus. In this study, we examined the role of the microtubule (MT) network in productive AAV infection. Using pharmacological reagents (e. g., nocodazole), live-cell imaging, and flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrated that AAV type 2 (AAV2) transduction was reduced by at least 2-fold in the absence of the MT network. Cell surface attachment and viral internalization were not dependent on an intact MT network. In treated cells at 2 h postinfection, quantitative three-dimensional (3D) microscopy determined a reproducible difference in number of intracellular particles associated with the nuclear membrane or the nucleus compared to that for controls (6 to 7% versus 26 to 30%, respectively). Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated a direct association of virions with MTs, further supporting a critical role in AAV infection. To investigate the underling mechanisms, we employed single-particle tracking (SPT) to monitor the viral movement in real time. Surprisingly, unlike other DNA viruses (e. g., adenovirus [Ad] and herpes simplex virus [HSV]) that display bidirectional motion on MTs, AAV2 displays only unidirectional movement on MTs toward the nuclei, with peak instantaneous velocities at 1.5 to 3.5 mu m/s. This rapid and unidirectional motion on MTs lasts for about 5 to 10 s and results in AAV particles migrating more than 10 mu m in the cytoplasm reaching the nucleus very efficiently. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis determined that, unlike Ad and HSV, AAV2 particles were transported on MTs within membranous compartments, and surprisingly, the acidification of AAV2-containing endosomes was delayed by the disruption of MTs. These findings together suggest an as-yet-undescribed model in which after internalization, AAV2 exploits MTs for rapid cytoplasmic trafficking in endosomal compartments unidirectionally toward the perinuclear region, where most acidification events for viral escape take place.

This theoretical itinerary, which was largely focused on Logic and Arithmetic, departed in principle from the renewed relations between Geometry and Physics occurring at the time. In particular, the key issue of physical measurement, as our only access to 'reality', played no part in its theoretical framework. This is in stark contrast to the position in Physics, where the role of measurement has been a core theoretical and epistemological issue since Poincare, Planck and Einstein. Furthermore, measurement is intimately related to unpredictability, (in-)determinism and the relationship with physical space-time. Computability, despite having exact access to its own discrete data type, provides a unique tool for the investigation of 'unpredictability' in both Physics and Biology through its fine-grained analysis of undecidability - note that unpredictability coincides with physical randomness in both classical and quantum frames. Moreover, it now turns out that an understanding of randomness in Physics and Biology is a key component of the intelligibility of Nature. In this paper, we will discuss a few results following along this line of thought.

Adverse outcomes of CVD include stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Atherosclerosis is considered to be the major cause of CVD and is estimated to cause half of all deaths in developed countries. Atherosclerotic lesions of the vessel wall may obstruct blood flow mechanically through stenosis, but rupture of atherosclerotic plaques causing formation of occlusive thrombi is far more prevalent. Unfortunately, conventional diagnostic tools fail to assess whether a plaque is vulnerable to rupture. Research over the past decade identified the biological processes that are implicated in the course towards plaque rupture, like cell death and inflammation. Knowledge about plaque biology propelled the development of imaging techniques that target biologic processes in order to predict the vulnerable plaque. This paper discusses novel and existing molecular imaging targets and addresses advantages and disadvantages of these targets and respective imaging techniques in respect of clinical application and socio-economic impact.

Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how M. oryzae is able to grow, acquire nutrients, and interact with the plant cell during infection. In particular, we describe direct mechanisms (such as the integration of carbon and nitrogen metabolism by trehalose-6-phospate synthase 1) and indirect mechanisms (such as the suppression of host responses) that allow M. oryzae to utilize available host nutrient. We contrast the ability of M. oryzae to voraciously metabolize a wide range of carbon and nitrogen sources in vitro with the carefully orchestrated development it displays during the biotrophic phase of in planta growth and ask how the two observations can be reconciled. We also look at how nutrient acquisition and effector biology might be linked in order to facilitate rapid colonization of the plant host.

We present two new formulations for the 3-club problem: one is compact and the other has a nonpolynomial number of constraints. By defining an integer compact relaxation of the second formulation, we obtain a new upper bound on the 3-club optimum that improves on the 3-clique number bound. We derive new families of valid inequalities for the 3-club polytope and use them to strengthen the LP relaxations of the new models. The computational study is performed on 120 graphs with up to 200 nodes and edge densities reported in the literature to produce difficult instances of the 3-club problem. The results show that the new compact formulation is competitive with the exact solution methods reported in the literature, and that a large proportion of the LP gap is bridged with the new valid inequalities.

Cerebral endothelial cells create and separate the compartments of the peripheral circulation and CNS creating the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selectively permeable boundary layer between these spaces. Interactions between activated leukocytes and cerebral endothelium play essential roles in mediating their trans-BBB diapedesis during normal immune surveillance and during pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases like MS. Extravasation of activated and committed leukocytes from the peripheral circulation through the endothelial layer of the BBB into the CNS milieu is the most fundamental step in formation of MS lesions. During MS pathogenesis, once the activated leukocytes enter the CNS environment, they propagate a massive wave of destruction which culminates in the loss of both myelin/oligodendrocyte complex and neurodegeneration. Multiple clinical and basic scientific observations support endothelial cell 'stress' and apoptosis as a hallmark characteristic of MS. The manipulation of the endothelial biology aiming to block trans-endothelial migration of activated immune cells into the CNS is a potent form of treatment for MS achieving significant reductions in disease activity and new lesion formation. In particular, endothelial microparticles are now well-recognized as important biomarkers and mediators of this type of stress. In this review, we discuss recent findings and new advances in our knowledge regarding leukocyte migration through the endothelial frontier of the BBB and how this can be exploited toward treating MS patients.

There is ample evidence that many disease mechanisms involve protein complexes, and being able to predict these complexes is important to the characterization of the relevant disease for diagnostic and treatment purposes. This article introduces a novel method for detecting protein complexes from PPI by using a protein ranking algorithm (ProRank). ProRank quantifies the importance of each protein based on the interaction structure and the evolutionarily relationships between proteins in the network. A novel way of identifying essential proteins which are known for their critical role in mediating cellular processes and constructing protein complexes is proposed and analyzed. We evaluate the performance of ProRank using two PPI networks on two reference sets of protein complexes created from Munich Information Center for Protein Sequence, containing 81 and 162 known complexes, respectively. We compare the performance of ProRank to some of the well known protein complex prediction methods (ClusterONE, CMC, CFinder, MCL, MCode and Core) in terms of precision and recall. We show that ProRank predicts more complexes correctly at a competitive level of precision and recall. The level of the accuracy achieved using ProRank in comparison to other recent methods for detecting protein complexes is a strong argument in favor of the proposed method. Proteins 2012;.

This paper examines the influence of these two different inquiry learning approaches on the attitudes of Israeli high school biology students toward their inquiry project. The results showed significant differences between the two groups: Open inquiry students were more satisfied and felt they gained benefits from implementing the project to a greater extent than guided inquiry students. On the other hand, regarding documentation throughout the project, guided inquiry students believed that they conducted more documentation, as compared to their open inquiry peers. No significant differences were found regarding 'the investment of time', but significant differences were found in the time invested and difficulties which arose concerning the different stages of the inquiry process: Open inquiry students believed they spent more time in the first stages of the project, while guided inquiry students believed they spent more time in writing the final paper. In addition, other differences were found: Open inquiry students felt more involved in their project, and felt a greater sense of cooperation with others, in comparison to guided inquiry students. These findings may help teachers who hesitate to teach open inquiry to implement this method of inquiry; or at least provide their students with the opportunity to be more involved in inquiry projects, and ultimately provide their students with more autonomy, high-order thinking, and a deeper understanding in performing science.

Thirteen upper secondary students, four tertiary students (studying chemical biology), and two experts were interviewed in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were structured around 2D illustrations of proteins and an animated representation of water transport through a channel in the cell membrane. In the analysis of the transcripts, a score, based on the SOLO-taxonomy, was given to each student to indicate the conceptual depth achieved in their explanations. The use of scientific terms and non-conventionalized expressions in the students' explanations were investigated based upon a semiotic approach. The results indicated that there was a positive relationship between use of scientific terms and level of education. However, there was no correlation between students' use of scientific terms and conceptual depth. In the interviews, we found that non-conventionalized expressions were used by several participants to express conceptual understanding and played a role in making sense of the visualizations of protein function. Interestingly, also the experts made use of non-conventionalized expressions. The results of our study imply that more attention should be drawn to students' use of scientific and non-conventionalized terms in relation to their conceptual understanding.

Drawing on the geography of thought, we argue that stubbornly tacit preformationist biological thought reflects and anchors social processes that limit adaptability in reaching toward sustainable living. We appeal for leveraging sustainability efforts by affirming in theory and in the public square an open image of human nature that recognises the participation of our ancestors in becoming who we are, obliging people to make their history together.

Two variants, p.K161N-hGALE and p.D175N-hGALE, have been previously found in combination with other alleles in patients with a mild form of the disease. Both variants were studied in vivo and in vitro and showed different levels of impairment. p.K161N-hGALE was severely impaired with substantially reduced enzymatic activity, increased thermal stability, reduced cofactor binding and no ability to rescue the galactose-sensitivity of gal10-null yeast. Interestingly p.K161N-hGALE showed less impairment of activity with UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine in comparison to UDP-galactose. Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed that p.K161N-hGALE was more stable than the wild-type protein and only changed stability in the presence of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and NAD(+). p.D175N-hGALE essentially rescued the galactose-sensitivity of gal10-null yeast, was less stable than the wild-type protein but showed increased stability in the presence of substrates and cofactor. We postulate that p.K161N-hGALE causes its effects by abolishing an important interaction between the protein and the cofactor, whereas p.D175N-hGALE is predicted to remove a stabilizing salt bridge between the ends of two alpha-helices that contain residues that interact with NAD(+). These results suggest that the cofactor binding is dynamic and that its loss results in significant structural changes that may be important in disease causation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, relevant modifications of glycolytic activity are required to intentionally modulate cellular phenotypes. Here, we designed a platform that allows switching control of glycolysis in Escherichia coli in response to an environmental signal, in this case, temperature. This system functions by regulating the expression of gapA, which encodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), one of the key glycolytic enzymes. Because a very low level of gapA expression is capable of maintaining cellular physiology, we also modified GAPDH through directed evolution to provide sensitive regulation of glycolytic activity. The switching control of glycolysis was successfully demonstrated by regulating the expression of engineered gapA through changes in temperature. This system offers potential control over the cell's central carbon-metabolism switch, providing the ability to perform reprogrammed tasks with desired timing depending on environmental signals.

While insulation can be performed by different methods, the identification of potentially disturbing reactions can become a rather lengthy undertaking requiring extensive experimental analysis and literature review. Therefore, a tool for network topology analysis in cell-free systems was developed based on genome scale metabolic models. Genome scale metabolic models define a potential network topology for living cells, and can be adapted to the characteristics of cell-free systems by: (i) removal of compartmentalization, (ii) application of different objective functions, (iii) enabling the accumulation of all metabolites, (iv) applying different constraints for substrate supply, and (v) constraining the reaction space through cofactor availability, microarray data, feasible reaction rates, and thermodynamics.

Thiazides however have a significant side effect profile and are frequently insufficient to normalize blood pressure alone. Thiazide-induced hyponatraemia (TIH) is a major adverse effect, affecting up to one in seven patients receiving these drugs. TIH is more common in females, the elderly and those of low body weight and may cause symptoms such as confusion, falls and seizures. It is a common cause of hospital admission in the elderly. Although TIH occurs at least as frequently as hypokalaemia, much less is understood about the mechanism by which this occurs. Thiazides lower blood pressure by reducing the reabsorption of sodium from the distal nephron by inhibition of the NaCl cotransporter. The molecular mechanism by which this occurs together with the little known role of thiazides in regulating water reabsorbtion from the collecting ducts is discussed and the relevance to TIH evaluated. TIH is highly reproducible by thiazide rechallenge suggesting there may be a genetic predisposition. Both targeted resequencing of candidate genes and genome wide association techniques offer promising strategies by which such genetic contributions may be investigated. The rewards for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying TIH and the regulation of distal nephron sodium and water absorption are significant; not only could it inform the design of better tolerated, more efficacious thiazide-like antihypertensive agents but it may also facilitate the pharmacogenomic profiling of hypertensive patients to avoid thiazides in those likely to suffer adverse effects.

The results show that: (1) Sodium bisulfite relaxed rat thoracic aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner (from 100 to 4000 mu M); however, sodium sulfite at 500 and 1000 mu M caused vasoconstriction, and only at higher concentrations (from 2000 to 4000 mu M) it caused vasorelaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. (2) The vasorelaxation caused by the bisulfite at low concentrations (<= 500 mu M) was endothelium-dependent, but at high concentrations (>= 1000 mu M) it was endothelium-independent. (3) The vasorelaxation by the bisulfite at the low concentrations was partially mediated by the cGMP pathway and the vasorelaxation was related to big-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel, but not due to prostaglandin, protein kinase C (PKC) and cAMP pathways. (4) The vasorelaxation by the bisulfite at high concentrations was partially inhibited by tetraethylammonium (TEA) and glibenclamide, suggesting that the vasorelaxation was related to ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K-ATP) and L-type calcium-channel. These results led to the conclusion that bisulfite (HSO3-) might be a vasoactive factor and sodium bisulfite can be used as a SO2 donor for the study of SO2 biology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol through lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins, in particular yields a proportional decrease in cardiovascular disease risk. Atherosclerosis is considered to be a complex chronic inflammatory process triggered by cardiovascular risk factors which cause endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory cell infiltration within the artery wall.

Among various molecular mechanisms, toll like receptors (TLRs) are potent proinflammatory cytokines that operate to induce inflammation play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

This phenomenon was observed in several species of the genus Saurida, but not in the other two genera. This melanization is caused by layers of melanosomes rich in melanin granules and deposited within the connective tissue of the submucosa, between the muscular wall and the muscularis submucosa. From this site this black submucosa extends into the folds of the mucosa. In S. tumbil and S. filamentosa, the entire alimentary tract is black, whereas in S. macrolepis only the stomach is partially or entirely black. This phenomenon and its possible importance are discussed.

The verification of animal-derived materials in foods and feeds is mandatory by several religious as well as regional and state laws. It is also essential to limit the transmission of food-borne pathogens and allergens. Verification of declared components further helps prevent unfair trades and protect consumers' trusts, religious faiths, and hard-earned fortunes. In this review, special emphasis is given to the molecular markers and their tracing tools in biology and nanotechnology. Among the four types of biomolecules, known as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids, DNA has been reported as the most appropriate biomarker to identify the source of animal-derived materials. While PCR has got enormous attention as the most effective molecular identification tool, PCR-based methods are not suitable for the unambiguous identification of very short DNA targets (15-30 bp) which can survive even in the harsh conditions of food and feed processing. Nanotechnology-based approaches using nanogap electrodes, quantum dots (QDs), and SERS-active nanoparticle shells are highly sensitive and can detect very short oligo targets almost at single-molecule sensitivity. However, nanogap fabrication has remained a challenging task and also involves complicated surface modification and immobilization chemistries. QD and SERS-based techniques also demand surface modifications and immobilization chemistries. On the other hand, gold nanoparticle (GNP)-based hybridization detection is label-free, sensitive, and does not involve any modification chemistry and expensive instrumentations. GNP-based biosensors offer a low-cost platform to detect and quantify short-length DNA markers in mixed biological and processed commercial foods.

Students' ability to asking questions is fundamental to developing critical reasoning, and to the process of scientific enquiry itself. Our premise is that questioning competences should become a central focus of current reforms in higher education. This study, part of a broader naturalistic research project, aims at developing a theoretical framework for conceptualizing different contexts for questioning, illustrating the application of the proposed framework (contextual questioning zones) and reflecting about some of the dimensions of teaching and learning, for overcoming some of the challenges that higher education institutions are facing presently. The discussion of two 'opposite' contexts of enquiry is based on qualitative data, gathered through close collaboration with four teachers of undergraduate biology at a Portuguese university. These teachers were observed during their 'daily activity' during an academic year. Data was also gathered by interviewing these teachers and 8 selected students, at the end of the year, and used to sustain the argumentation. The paper concludes with some reflections and suggestions to promote authentic enquiry-based learning experiences.

Yet few studies have examined disciplinary variation in norms for interactive teaching, and their relationship to teaching practice, particularly from a cognitive perspective. This study examines these problems using survey (n = 436) and interview (n = 56) data collected from faculty at three research universities in the United States in math, physics, chemistry, biology and geology departments. These data are analyzed using quantitative (i.e., ANOVA and ANCOVA) and qualitative (i.e., thematic and causal network analysis) techniques to provide multi-faceted accounts of normative systems. Results indicate that perceived norms for interactive teaching are weak or non-existent, yet other types of norms including those regarding course content, tacit norms for instructional autonomy and norms instantiated in course syllabi are present. Significant differences in perceived norms were found between institutions and disciplines, with biology and physics departments at two research sites exhibiting significantly stronger norms than other departments. Analyses of relationships between perceived norms and teaching practice indicated significant relationships between norm strength and the use of two teaching methods. Further, analyses of interview data revealed complex chains of decision-making involving considerations of course syllabi, student characteristics, and feedback mechanisms. Implications for pedagogical reform include the need to understand local cultural conditions and decision-making patterns to inform program design and implementation.

Aloes exhibit remarkable morphological variability and range in size from dwarf species only a few centimetres tall, to tree aloes reaching heights of up to 20 m. Aloes form a striking and important component of many arid and semi-arid African landscapes. Most Aloe species occur in arid savanna, which is widespread over subtropical southern and eastern Africa. In southern Africa, aloes receive considerable interest from both scientists and succulent plant enthusiasts. World-renowned for their medicinal properties, aloes are used in numerous natural products traded in the health and cosmetic industries. There is a wealth of popular literature on the genus, as well as various scientific publications, although these have tended to focus on aloe pollination biology and medicinal use. Knowledge on aloe ecology is vital for the management and conservation of wild populations as well as the arid and semi-arid lands in which they occur. Sound ecological understanding of the genus is also important for making decisions regarding sustainable utilization, as well as predictions relating to possible threats posed by climate change. Furthermore, by better understanding the genus, its utility in practical applications such as ecosystem restoration can be explored further. Hence, this review provides a synthesis of a wide range of available information on several aspects of aloe ecology, and highlights important opportunities for future research. The key aspects covered include aloe distribution, ecophysiology, functional role in the ecosystem, population dynamics, fire tolerance, resprouting, pollination ecology, seed biology, economic botany and conservation.

Loss-of-function mutations in CDH3, which encodes P-cadherin, result in hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD), an autosomal recessive disorder featuring sparse and short hair. Here, we attempted to recapitulate some aspects of HJMD in vitro by transfecting normal, organ-cultured human scalp HFs with lipofectamine and CDH3-specific or scrambled control siRNAs. As in HJMD patients, P-cadherin silencing inhibited hair shaft growth, prematurely induced HF regression (catagen), and inhibited hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation. In situ, membrane beta-catenin expression and transcription of the beta-catenin target gene, axin2, were significantly reduced, whereas glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) and phospho-beta-catenin immunoreactivity were increased. These effects were partially reversed by inhibiting GSK3 beta. P-cadherin silencing reduced the expression of the anagen-promoting growth factor, IGF-1, whereas that of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF beta 2; catagen promoter) was enhanced. Neutralizing TGF beta antagonized the catagen-promoting effects of P-cadherin silencing. In summary, we introduce human HFs as an attractive preclinical model for studying the functions of P-cadherin in human epithelial biology and pathology. This model demonstrates that cadherins can be successfully knocked down in an intact human organ in vitro, and shows that P-cadherin is needed for anagen maintenance by regulating canonical Wnt signaling and suppressing TGF beta 2.

To understand how the cell-scale active transport and passive diffusion combine to produce the effective tissue-scale flux, we apply asymptotic methods to a cell-based model of auxin transport to derive systematically a continuum description from the spatially discrete one. Using biologically relevant parameter values, we show how the carriers drive the dominant tissue-scale auxin flux and we predict how the overall auxin dynamics are affected by perturbations to these carriers, for example, in knockout mutants. The analysis shows how the dominant behaviour depends on the cells' lengths, and enables us to assess the relative importance of the diffusive auxin flux through the cell wall. Other distinguished limits are also identified and their potential roles discussed. As well as providing insight into auxin transport, the study illustrates the use of multiscale (cell to tissue) methods in deriving simplified models that retain the essential biology and provide understanding of the underlying dynamics.

Yet protected areas are not isolated environmental compounds. Many threats breach their borders, including transportation infrastructure. Despite an abundance of roads in many protected areas, the impact of roads on biota within these protected areas is usually unaccounted for in threat mitigation efforts. As landscapes become further developed and the importance of protected areas increases, knowledge of how roads impact on the persistence of species at large scales and whether protected areas provide relief from this process is vital. We took a two-staged approach to analysing landscape-scale habitat use and road-kill impacts of the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), a large, widely distributed herbivore, within New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Firstly, we modelled their state-wide distribution from atlas records and evaluated the relationship between habitat suitability and wombat road fatalities at that scale. Secondly, we used local-scale fatality data to derive an annual estimate of wombats killed within an optimal habitat area. We then combined these two approaches to derive a measure of total wombats killed on roads within the protected area network. Our results showed that common wombats have a broad distribution (290,981 km(2)), one quarter (24.9 %) of their distribution lies within protected areas, and the percentage of optimal habitat contained within protected areas is 35.6 %, far greater than the COP10 guidelines of 17 %. Problematically, optimal habitat within protected areas was not a barrier to the effects of road-kill, as we estimated that the total annual count of wombat road-kill in optimal habitat within protected areas could be as high as 13.6 % of the total NSW population. These findings suggest that although protected areas are important spatial refuges for biodiversity, greater effort should be made to evaluate how reserves confer resilience from the impacts of roads across geographic ranges.

Herein, we present the first estimate of walrus numbers from the Pechora Sea based on an aerial survey of 2,563 km of coastline, using a combination of infrared techniques and digital imagery. Hauled out walruses were found at three sites (Vaygach Island and two sites on Matveyev Island). A total of 968 animals were counted on aerial photographs; all of the animals appeared to be males. Crude measurements of dorsal curvilinear lengths of a subset of the photographed animals (N = 504) showed that many were adults, but 14.5 % belonged to younger age classes (shorter than 225 cm). Using an adjustment factor developed for male walruses in Svalbard, to account for animals at sea during the survey, the number of walruses occupying this area was estimated to be 3,943 (95 % CI, 3,605-4,325). No females with calves were seen in this survey, implying that the population that uses the Pechora Sea during summer has a distributional area that is larger than the survey area. Extensive oil exploration, development and production are currently taking place in the Pechora Sea. Risks posed to walruses and their prey by these industrial activities should be assessed immediately, and the genetic delineations of this population should be clarified.

Using a two-fold change minimum threshold, we found 18 genes that were differentially expressed (10 up-regulated and eight down-regulated) between the sensitive and resistant animal groups. Our gene ontology analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes are involved in a variety of biological processes, including immune responses, extracellular modification (e.g. glycosylation), cell adhesion and signal transduction, all of which are related to the anabolic metabolism of glycolipids, as well as to inflammation- and immune-related pathways. Based on the genes identified in the screen and the pathway analysis results, real-time PCR was used to test the involvement of ST3GAL1 and A genes (of glycolipid-related pathways), SLA-1 and SLA-3 genes (of inflammation- and immune-related pathways), as well as the differential genes FUT1, TAP1 and SLA-DQA. Subsequently, real-time PCR was performed to validate seven differentially expressed genes screened out by the microarray approach, and sufficient consistency was observed between the two methods.

Nitrogen is a primary resource limiting the growth of plants. In this study, we investigated nitrogen allocation to the photosynthetic protein Rubisco and to cell walls in invasive and native tall form Spartina alterniflora to explore the mechanisms behind its successful invasion. We conducted an experiment with seeds from three populations collected respectively from its introduced range in Jiangsu Province, China, and from its native range in Georgia, USA. Seeds were germinated, and plants from all populations were grown in a greenhouse at low and high levels of nitrogen for several months. We found an increased allocation of leaf nitrogen to Rubisco of invasive tall form S. alterniflora relative to its native conspecifics in the limited nitrogen condition. Nitrogen addition had significant effect on leaf nitrogen allocation in Rubisco and cell walls of native S. alterniflora, but did not influence those of invasive populations. Invasive S. alterniflora had higher Rubisco content and photosynthetic rate than native S. alterniflora in both nitrogen treatments, but no significant differences were found in cell wall content, fraction of leaf nitrogen in cell walls and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The increased photosynthetic capacity of invaders relative to native plants resulted from the significantly higher fraction of nitrogen allocated to Rubisco and higher nitrogen content in the low nitrogen treatment, but only higher nitrogen content in the high nitrogen treatment. Our results suggest that shifts in these leaf traits following its introduction to a new range may play an important role in invasion success of tall form S. alterniflora.

D. vexillum can inflict ecological and economic damage through biofouling and habitat modification. Natural and anthropogenic processes that fragment colonies of D. vexillum may be accelerating the spread of this invader. Reattachment success and fragment viability were confirmed in the laboratory after four weeks of suspension in experimental aquaria. The shape of suspended D. vexillum fragments progressed from flattened to globular spheres and then flattened again after reattachment to the substrate. Reproductive activity, confirmed by the presence of eggs and larvae, was observed for fragments suspended up to 3 weeks suggesting that D. vexillum is capable of reproducing while in a fragmented, suspended state. An index of colony health was used to monitor change in D. vexillum health while in suspension. Overall, colony health declined with time in suspension although colonies that appeared dead (black and gray in overall color) still contained a substantial number of healthy live zooids. These results suggest that activities that cause fragmentation can significantly facilitate the spread of D. vexillum. Coastal managers should consider reducing or eliminating, when practical, activities that return fragmented colonies of D. vexillum to the water. In-water cleaning of biofouling and dredging are likely expediting the spread of this invasive species unless biofouling can be contained and removed from the water.

Since the infectious pathogen of prion diseases is composed of multimeric PrPSc assemblies, we hypothesized that this antiprion property could be enhanced by attaching multiple quinacrine-derived chloroquinoline or acridine moieties to a scaffold. In addition to exploring Congo red dye and tetraphenylporphyrin tetracarboxylic acid scaffolds, which already possess intrinsic prion-binding ability; trimesic acid was used in this role. In practice, Congo red itself could not be modified with chloroquinoline or acridine units, and a modified dicarboxyl analog was also unreactive. The latter also lacked antiprion activity in infected cultured cells. While addition of chloroquinoline to a tetraphenylporphyrin tetracarboxylic acid scaffold resulted in some reduction of PrPSc, moieties attached to a trimesic acid scaffold exhibited sub-micromolar IC50's as well as a toxicity profile superior to quinacrine. Antiprion activity of these molecules was influenced by the length, polarity, and rigidity associated with the variable linear or cyclic polyamine tethers, and in some instances was modulated by host-cell and/or strain type. Unexpectedly, several compounds in our series increased PrPSc levels. Overall, inhibitory and enhancing properties of these multivalent compounds offer new avenues for structure-based investigation of prion biology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One of the major hurdles in understanding the assembly of oligosaccharide assembly is a lack of chemical tools to study this process, since bactoprenols and the resulting isoprenoid-linked oligosaccharides lack handles or chromophores for use in pathway analysis. Here we describe the isolation of a new UPPS from the symbiotic microorganism Bacteroides fragilis, a key species in the human microbiome. The protein was purified to homogeneity and utilized to accept a chromophore containing farnesyl diphosphate analogue as a substrate. The analogue was utilized by the enzyme and resulted in a bactoprenyl diphosphate product with an easy to monitor tag associated with it. Furthermore, the diphosphate is shown to be readily converted to monophosphate using a common molecular biology reagent. This monophosphate product allowed for the investigation of complex oligosaccharide biosynthesis, and was used to probe the activity of glycosyltransferases involved in the well characterized Campylobacter jejuni N-linked protein glycosylation. Novel reagents similar to this will provide key tools for the study of uncharacterized oligosaccharide assemblies, and open the possibility for the development of rapid screening methodology for these biosynthetic systems.

Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) promote cancer stem cell proliferation in many solid tumours. This study assesses whether EGF, bFGF and IGF signalling pathways are essential for colon CSC proliferation and self-renewal. Material and methods Colon CSCs were cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) with one of the following growth factors: EGF, bFGF or IGF. Characteristics of CSC gene expression were evaluated by real time PCR. Tumourigenicity of CSCs was determined using a xenograft model in vivo. Effects of EGF receptor inhibitors, Gefitinib and PD153035, on CSC proliferation, apoptosis and signalling were evaluated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and western blotting. Results Colon cancer cell HCT116 transformed to CSCs in SFM. Compared to other growth factors, EGF was essential to support proliferation of CSCs that expressed higher levels of progenitor genes (Musashi-1, LGR5) and lower levels of differential genes (CK20). CSCs promoted more rapid tumour growth than regular cancer cells in xenografts. EGFR inhibitors suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of CSCs by inhibiting autophosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signalling proteins, such as Akt kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2). Conclusions This study indicates that EGF signalling was essential for formation and maintenance of colon CSCs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small, non-coding endogenous RNAs, similar to 22 nucleotides (nt) in length, have been well characterized to play essential roles in regulation of the autophagy process in cancer; however, how these miRNAs regulate autophagic pathways in plant lectin-induced cancer cells, still remains an enigma. Materials and methods Identification of microRNA-regulated autophagic pathways was carried out using a series of elegant systems biology and bioinformatics approaches, such as network construction, hub protein identification, targeted microRNA prediction, microarray analyses and molecular docking. Results We computationally constructed the human autophagic proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network, and further modified this network into a plant lectin-induced network. Subsequently, we identified 9 autophagic hub proteins and 13 relevant oncogenic and tumour suppressive miRNAs, that could regulate these aforementioned targeted autophagic hub proteins, in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. In addition, we confirmed that plant lectins could block the sugar-containing receptor EGFR-mediated survival pathways, involved in autophagic hub proteins and relevant miRNAs, thereby ultimately culminating in autophagic cell death. Conclusions These results demonstrate that network-based identification of microRNAs modulate autophagic pathways in plant lectin-treated cancer cells, which may shed new light on the discovery of plant lectins as potent autophagic inducers, for cancer drug discovery.

More recently, it has become clear that this may involve not only local chromatin organization but also distant regulatory elements that participate in large-scale chromatin architecture within the nucleus. We describe recent methods that make possible the detection of such structures and apply them to analysis of the human insulin (INS) locus in pancreatic islets. We show that the INS gene is part of an extended open chromatin domain that includes adjacent genes as well. We also find that in islets, the INS promoter is in physical contact with distant sites on the same human chromosome and notably, with the SYT8 gene, located nearly 300 kb away. The strength of the contact between INS and SYT8 is increased by glucose, and this results in stimulation of SYT8 expression. Inhibition of INS transcription decreases SYT8 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of SYT8 results in decreased secretion of insulin. Our results thus establish the existence of a regulatory network between the INS gene and other distant genes through long-range physical interactions, and suggest that such networks may have general importance for insulin biology and diabetes.

At the forefront of this paradigm shift was a report by Krssak and colleagues (Diabetologia 1999; 42:113-116) showing that intramyocellular lipid content, measured via the (then) novel application of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, served as a robust indicator of muscle insulin sensitivity in healthy individuals. A subsequent wave of investigations produced compelling correlative evidence linking ectopic lipid deposition within skeletal myocytes to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. But this relationship has proven much more complex than originally imagined, and scientists today are still left wondering if and how the intramyocellular accumulation of lipid droplets has a direct bearing on insulin action. Originally viewed as a simple storage depot, the lipid droplet is now recognised as an essential and sophisticated organelle that actively participates in numerous cellular processes.

The clonal nature of the disease can be established in most adult patients by the demonstration of activating KIT mutations in their BM MC. When highly sensitive techniques capable of identifying cells present at very low frequencies in a sample are applied, BM MC from virtually all systemic mastocytosis patients display unique immunophenotypical features, particularly the aberrant expression of CD25. By contrast, large, multifocal BM MC aggregates (the only World Health Organization major criterion for systemic mastocytosis) are absent in a significant proportion of patients fulfilling at least three minor criteria for systemic mastocytosis, particularly in subjects studied at early stages of the disease with very low MC burden. Moreover, recent molecular and immunophenotypical investigations of BM MC from patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis have revealed a close association of some biological features (e.g., multilineage involvement of hematopoiesis by the KIT mutation and an immature mast cell immunophenotype) with an increased risk for disease progression. These observations support the fact that, although the current consensus diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis have been a major advance for the diagnosis and classification of the disease, rationale usage of the most sensitive diagnostic techniques available nowadays is needed to improve the diagnosis, refine the classification, and reach objective prognostic stratification of adult mastocytosis.

Several genes have been identified in AML, such as FLT3, KIT, NPM1, and JAK2. This study investigated the frequency of novel mutations in IDH1 (amino acid R132) and IDH2 (R140 and R172) and analyzed their impact on disease biology and interaction with other mutations in Chinese patients with de novo AML. Methods: A total of 195 patients were screened for mutations in the IDH1, IDH2, JAK2 V617F, NPM1, FLT3, and KIT genes, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based and direct sequencing assays. Results: IDH mutations occurred at a considerable frequency of 15.89% in Chinese AML cases; IDH2 R140Q was the most frequent genetic alteration and was associated with older age, normal karyotype, and French-American-British classification M2 at diagnosis. There was a strong association of IDH2 mutation with NPM1 mutations and a trend with FLT3-internal-tandem duplication. Conclusion: IDH mutations may be a novel genetic marker in cytogenetically normal AML and may cooperate in leukemogenesis.

The scarcity of robust chordoma cell lines has limited the ability to study this tumor. In this report, we describe the establishment of a novel chordoma cell line and characterize its in vitro and in vivo behaviors. The tumor tissue was isolated from a patient with recurrent chordoma of the sacrum. After 6 months in culture, the chordoma cell line, referred here as CH22, was established. Microscopic analysis of two-dimensional culture confirmed that the CH22 cells exhibited a typical vacuolated cytoplasm similar to the well-established chordoma cell line U-CH1. Electron microscopy showed cohesive cells with numerous surface filopodia, pockets of glycogen and aggregates of intermediate tonofilaments in cytoplasm. Three-dimensional culture revealed that the CH22 cells could grow and form clusters by day 8. The MTT assays demonstrated that, compared with sensitive osteosarcoma cell lines, CH22 cells were relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the CH22 cells expressed brachyury, vimentin, and cytokeratin. Finally, histological analysis of CH22 xenograft tumor tissues demonstrated the appearance of physaliphorous cells and positive staining of brachyury, cytokeratin, and S100. By CT and MRI, imaging xenografts showed the typical appearances seen in human chordomas. These findings suggest that the established novel human chordoma cell line CH22 and its tumorigenecity in SCID nude mice may serve as an important model for studying chordoma cell biology and the development of new therapeutic modalities.

The aim of this study was to detect quantitative trait loci and the associated positional candidate genes affecting baseline serum Ca++ concentrations. A genome-wide association study was conducted in an F-2 intercross population between Landrace and Korean native pigs using the porcine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 60 K beadchip and the PLINK program based on linear regression. Data used in the study included 410 F-2 pigs. All experimental animals were genotyped with 36,613 SNP markers located throughout the pig autosomes. We identified a strong association between a SNP marker on chromosome 7 and serum Ca++ levels (DIAS0002191, genomic control-corrected P = 7.7 x 10(-5)). The position of DIAS0002191 was closely located to SLA class III region containing the C2 gene encoding the complementary component 2 protein, a protein which is important in the humoral immune responses. De novo sequencing of the porcine C2 gene revealed a missense mutation [c.1963A < G (N655D)] and this missense mutation was also strongly associated with serum Ca++ concentrations (genomic control-corrected P = 5.9 x 10(-5)). Further studies are necessary to investigate the effect of this missense mutation at a functional-molecular level. In conclusion, the missense mutation of the C2 gene identified in this study may help in elucidating the genetic factors underlying humoral immune reactions.

There are several proposed mechanisms of formation of RSNO in vivo: auto-oxidation of center dot NO, transnitrosation, oxidative nitrosylation, and from dinitrosyliron complexes (DNIC). Both free center dot NO, generated by center dot NO donors, and S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO) are widely used to study center dot NO biology and signaling, including protein S-nitrosation. It is assumed that the cellular effects of both compounds are analogous and indicative of in vivo center dot NO biology. A quantitative comparison was made of formation of DNIC and RSNO, the major center dot NO-derived cellular products. In RAW 264.7 cells, both center dot NO and CysNO were metabolized, leading to rapid intracellular RSNO and DNIC formation. DNIC were the dominant products formed from physiologic center dot NO concentrations, however, and RSNO were the major product from CysNO treatment. Chelatable iron was necessary for DNIC assembly from either center dot NO or CysNO, but not for RSNO formation. These profound differences in RSNO and DNIC formation from center dot NO and CysNO question the use of CysNO as a surrogate for physiologic center dot NO. Researchers designing experiments intended to elucidate the biological signaling mechanisms of center dot NO should be aware of these differences and should consider the biological relevance of the use of exogenous CysNO.

However, the mechanisms by which S-nitrosothiols are formed are still largely unknown, and there are gaps of understanding between the known chemical biology of S-nitrosothiols and their reported functions. Recent Advances: This review attempts to describe the biological chemistry of S-nitrosation and to point out where the challenges lie in matching the known chemical biology of these compounds with their reported functions. The review will detail new discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the formation of S-nitrosothiols in biological systems. Critical Issues: Although S-nitrosothiols may be formed with some degree of specificity on particular protein thiols, through un-catalyzed chemistry, and mechanisms for their degradation and redistribution are present, these processes are not sufficient to explain the vast array of specific and targeted responses of NO that have been attributed to S-nitrosation. Elements of catalysis have been discovered in the formation, distribution, and metabolism of S-nitrosothiols, but it is less clear whether these represent a specific network for targeted NO-dependent signaling. Future Directions: Much recent work has uncovered new targets for S-nitrosation through either targeted or proteome-wide approaches There is a need to understand which of these modifications represent concerted and targeted signaling processes and which is an inevitable consequence of living with NO. There is still much to be learned about how NO transduces signals in cells and the role played by protein S-nitrosation. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 17, 969-980.

Premature infants at risk of developing chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are now born at the late canalicular stage of lung development, just when the airways become juxtaposed to the lung vasculature and when gas-exchange becomes possible. Readily available strategies, including improved antenatal management (education, regionalization, steroids, and antibiotics), together with exogenous surfactant and exclusive/early noninvasive ventilatory support, will likely decrease the incidence/severity of BPD over the next few years. Nonetheless, because of the extreme immaturity of the developing lung, the extent to which disruption of lung growth after prematurity and neonatal management lead to an earlier or more aggravated decline in respiratory function in later life is a matter of concern. Consequently, much more needs to be learned about the mechanisms of lung development, injury, and repair. Recent insight into stem cell biology has sparked interest for stem cells to repair damaged organs. This review summarizes the exciting potential of stem cell-based therapies for lung diseases in general and BPD in particular. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 17, 1013-1040.

We undertook analysis on some formulations of chondroitin sulfates available for oral administration. The analysis was based on agarose-gel electrophoresis, strong anion-exchange chromatography, digestibility with specific GAG lyases, uronic acid content, NMR spectroscopy, and size-exclusion chromatography. Keratan sulfate was detected in batches from shark cartilage, averaging similar to 16% of the total GAG. Keratan sulfate is an inert material, and hazardous effects due to its presence in these formulations are unlikely to occur. However, its unexpected high percentage compromises the desired amounts of the real ingredient specified on the label claims, and forewarns the pharmacopeias to update their monographs. The techniques they recommended, especially cellulose acetate electrophoresis, are inefficient in detecting keratan sulfate in chondroitin sulfate formulations. In addition, this finding also alerts the manufacturers for improved isolation procedures as well as the supervisory agencies for better audits. Analysis based on strong anion-exchange chromatography is shown to be more reliable than the methods presently suggested by standard pharmacopeias. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sophisticated networks of intimately intertwined signaling pathways coordinate cellular functions. Clear understanding how the integration of multiple inputs produces coherent behavior is one of the major challenges of cell biology. Integration via perfectly timed highly regulated protein-protein interactions and precise targeting of the ""output"" proteins to particular substrates is emerging as a common theme of signaling regulation. This often involves specialized scaffolding proteins, whose key function is to ensure that correct partners come together in an appropriate place at the right time. Defective or faulty signaling underlies many congenital and acquired human disorders. Several pioneering studies showed that ectopic expression of existing proteins or their elements can restore functions destroyed by mutations or normalize the signaling pushed out of balance by disease and/or current small molecule-based therapy. Several recent studies show that proteins with new functional modalities can be generated by mixing and matching existing domains, or via functional recalibration and fine-tuning of existing proteins by precisely targeted mutations. Using arrestins as an example, we describe how manipulation of individual functions yields signaling-biased proteins. Creative protein redesign generates novel tools valuable for unraveling the intricacies of cell biology. Engineered proteins with specific functional changes also have huge therapeutic potential in disorders associated with inherited or acquired signaling errors. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A multi-marker approach to assessing the distinctiveness of genetic lineages in the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens","Abstract: A genetic boundary at the Mississippi River, USA, has been suggested for the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, which was recently proposed for listing as federally threatened in the western USA. This suggestion was made on the basis of limited geographic sampling of a mitochondrial gene. However, mitochondrial DNA represents a very small part of the genome and is not necessarily indicative of patterns in nuclear DNA. We tested the hypothesis that eastern and western populations are separated by a distinct genetic boundary by sequencing mitochondrial DNA more extensively across the range, including focused sampling in the zone of hypothetical introgression, and by analyzing four nuclear sequences and seven microsatellite loci. We confirmed previous results that eastern and western populations have unique mitochondrial sequences that are deeply divergent (3.8 %) and which overlap only in a narrow region around the Mississippi River. Nuclear sequences also show divergent eastern and western lineages in some cases but with a broader zone of geographic overlap. Microsatellite data correspond closely to mitochondrial data, differing between east and west and changing abruptly near the Mississippi River. These data collectively demonstrate that eastern and western clades of this species introgress considerably in some markers but are distinct and defined by clear and narrow boundaries in others. We demonstrate that the Mississippi River forms an important, albeit somewhat permeable, boundary between genetic lineages in this species. This genetic boundary coincides with previously described discontinuities in morphological features.

Although artificial reproduction has been attempted since the 1930s and large numbers of studies have been conducted, it has not yet fully succeeded. Problems in eel artificial breeding are highly diverse, for instance, lack of basic information about reproduction in nature, no appropriate food for larvae, high mortality, and high individual variation in adults in response to maturation induction. Over the last decade, genomic data have been obtained for a variety of aquatic organisms. Recent technological advances in sequencing and computation now enable the accumulation of genomic information even for non-model species. The draft genome of the European eel Anguilla anguilla has been recently determined using Illumina technology and transcriptomic data based on next generation sequencing have been emerging. Extensive genomic information will facilitate many aspects of the artificial reproduction of eels. Here, we review the progress in genome-wide studies of eels, including additional analysis of the European eel genome data, and discuss future directions and implications of genomic data for aquaculture.

The establishment of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line as an efficient and reliable experimental research tool was considered a major advance toward the understanding of the wild-type mast cell population's biology. The development of sub-clone RBL-IV (HR+) led to the isolation of histamine-secreting RBL-2H3 cell line. Since then, RBL-2H3 cells have been extensively used for studying the IgE high affinity receptor (Fc epsilon RI) interactions with their ligand, the IgE antibody. This cell line has been employed for generating human and more recently canine and equine Fc epsilon RI alpha-transfected RBL cell lines facilitating an assessment of the residues involved in the complementary interaction between the IgE molecules from these species and their cognate high affinity receptor. A proteomics-based approach to the definition of IgE-receptor-mediated signaling pathways was also carried out using this cell line. Furthermore. RBL-2H3 cells have the potential of being used to assess the potential allergenicity of antigens to humans and other animals like dogs and horses which are known to suffer from similar allergic manifestations.

Plants there and in the adjacent Mediterranean zone exhibit striking adaptations, and we here address the question whether in a species-rich clade such adaptations arose in parallel, at different times, or simultaneously. Answering this type of question has been a major concern of evolutionary biology over the past few years, with a growing consensus that lineages tend to be conservative in their vegetative traits and niche requirements. Combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences for 112 species of Oxalidales (4900 aligned nucleotides) were used for a fossil-calibrated phylogeny that includes 43 of the 54 species of Chilean Oxalis, and species distribution models (SDMs) incorporating precipitation, temperature, and fog, and the phylogeny were used to reconstruct ancestral habitat preferences, relying on likelihood and Bayesian techniques. Since uneven collecting can reduce the power of SDMs, we compared 3 strategies to correct for collecting effort. Unexpectedly, the Oxalis flora of Chile consists of 7 distant lineages that originated at different times prior to the last Andean uplift pulse; some had features preadapting them to seasonally arid or xeric conditions. Models that incorporated fog and a ""collecting activity surface"" performed best and identified the Mediterranean zone as a hotspot of Oxalis species as well as lineage diversity because it harbors a mix of ancient and young groups, including insufficiently arid-adapted species.

The high biosafety level III required to tackle its causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis seriously hinders the exploration of its biology and new countermeasures. M. smegmatis is a widely recognized good surrogate of M. tuberculosis, largely due to their conserved transcriptional machinery, sigma factors, and two-component systems. However, their distinct lifestyles often confound the explanation of the results. M. tuberculosis leads both parasitic and free life, while M. smegmatis is largely saprophyte. To make full advantage of this model, it is helpful to discover the genome features associated with M. smegmatis unique niches, such as its saprophytic life, high salt tolerance, and relative short generation time. We employed the gene ontology enrichment analysis to characterize the unique lifestyle of M. smegmatis. Gene ontology enrichment analysis provided 12 terms; most are relevant to the special lifestyle of M. smegmatis, especially the saprophytic niche, high salt tolerance adaptation, and short generation time. In-depth functional characterization of these genes will shed new lights on the genetic basis of M. smegmatis saprophytic life and hasten the understanding of the unique biology of M. tuberculosis.

Charlesworth (1992) has argued that developmentalists avoid evolution because they perceive it as running contrary to meliorist attitudes that are predominate in the field. Other scholars have suggested that evolution is ignored by social scientists because of a lack of knowledge about the theory. In this study, we suggest that resistance among developmentalists toward evolution may occur due to individual differences in life history and personality traits. We examine the meliorist attitudes, life history and personality traits of faculty, graduate and undergraduates in family studies in human development and the effect these variables have on the acceptance and usage of evolutionary theory in academia.

Visible signs of fluorosis begin to become obvious on the enamel surface as opacities, implying some porosity in the tissue. The mechanisms that conduct the formation of fluorotic enamel are unknown, but should involve modifications in the basic physical-chemistry reactions of demineralization and remineralisation of the enamel of the teeth, which is the same reaction of formation of the enamel's hydroxyapatite (HAp) in the maturation phase. The increase of the amount of fluoride inside of the apatite will result in gradual increase of the lattice parameters. The aim of this work is to characterize the healthy and fluorotic enamel in human tooth using Synchrotron X-ray diffraction. All the scattering profile measurements were carried out at the X-ray diffraction beamline (XRD1) at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory-LNLS, Campinas, Brazil.

Nevertheless, there is only one commercially available species, Episyrphus balteatus, which despite naturally occurring in the Mediterranean basin, is not the best adapted to the conditions found in its agricultural areas. Sphaerophoria rueppellii is another common hoverfly species in the Mediterranean area both in outdoor and greenhouse crops. However, little information about the biology of this species is known and this is one of the main requirements for every control-based IPM program. In this work we assess the influence of different humidity and temperature combinations on the performance (mortality, developmental time and sublethal effects) of S. rueppellii under controlled conditions. We also study the effect of aphid supply during larval stage on mortality and developmental time of immature stages and on sublethal effects on adults. The results show that this species requires high environmental humidity (higher than 60%) to complete its development. Also, S. rueppellii is able to properly develop at a wide range of temperatures (20-30 degrees C). S. rueppellii reduces its voracity under low aphid density conditions, being able to adapt its feeding rate to the aphid availability. Mortality was not affected by food supply, while low prey availability led to longer developmental time and a decrease in larval and pupal weight and adult body size. These results show the suitability of this species as an aphid biological control agent under high humidity and temperature conditions, such as the ones inside Mediterranean greenhouses.

We have used immunohistochemistry (IHC) and isotope-based liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to investigate the presence and distribution of 5hmC in human brain and brain tumors. In the normal adult brain, IHC identified 61.5% 5hmC positive cells in the cortex and 32.4% 5hmC in white matter (WM) areas. In tumors, positive staining of cells ranged from 1.1% in glioblastomas (GBMs) (WHO Grade IV) to 8.9% in Grade I gliomas (pilocytic astrocytomas). In the normal adult human brain, LC-MS also showed highest values in cortical areas (1.17% 5hmC/dG [deoxyguanosine]), in the cerebral WM we measured around 0.70% 5hmC/dG. 5hmC levels were related to tumor differentiation, ranging from lowest values of 0.078% 5hmC/dG in GBMs (WHO Grade IV) to 0.24% 5hmC/dG in WHO Grade II diffuse astrocytomas. 5hmC measurements were unrelated to 5mC values.

Regulators of neural stem or progenitor cells biology may thus influence aspects of brain tumorigenesis, such as the maintenance of tumor-propagating potential. We investigated the role of Pax6, a neurogenic transcription factor already suggested as a positive prognostic marker for human gliomas, in a well-characterized in vivo model of PDGF-B-driven oligodendroglioma. In this system, the expression of Pax6 severely impairs tumor propagation by inducing a reduction of cell proliferation and the acquisition of differentiation traits in tumor-initiating cells. The overexpression of Pax6 correlates with a downregulation of Olig2, a bHLH transcription factor that normally antagonizes Pax6 in adult neurogenic niches and that plays a key role in the maintenance of neural stem and progenitor cells. Furthermore, we found that Olig2 is strictly required to maintain the malignancy of oligodendroglioma cells, since its silencing by interfering RNA abrogates tumor propagation. We finally show evidence that this function depends, at least in part, on the silencing of ID4, a dominant negative bHLH protein, whose upregulation follows Olig2 loss. In our model, the upregulation of ID4 mimics the loss of Olig2 in impairing the tumor-propagating potential of glioma cells. Our data, therefore, establish the relevance of physiological regulators of neural stem cell biology in regulating glial tumor malignancy and provide support for their functional interactions in this context.

On the other hand, owing to possessing easy magnetic separation and large surface properties, magnetic nanoparticles have also been employed as special carriers to immobilize biomolecules. In this paper, the magnetic nanoparticles are prepared by soft-template method with uniform shape and good dispersion. Then a detection method of hepatitis B virus DNA is established taking advantages of both chemilumiescence with the system of alkaline phosphatase catalyzing 3-(2'-spiroadamantane)- 4-methoxy -4-(3 ''-phosphoryloxy) phenyl-1, 2-dioxetane and magnetic nanoparticles. The optimization of conditions affecting the hybridization reaction and the chemilumiescence detection are also investigated to promise a high sensitivity.

Different from all other analytic methods. HAM provides us with a simple way to adjust and control the convergence region of solution series by choosing proper values for auxiliary parameter h. The fractional derivative is described in the Caputo sense. The reason of using fractional order differential equations (FOD) is that FOD are naturally related to systems with memory which exists in most biological systems. Also they are closely related to fractals which are abundant in biological systems. The results derived of the fractional system are of a more general nature. Respectively, solutions of FOD spread at a faster rate than the classical differential equations, and may exhibit asymmetry. However, the fundamental solutions of these equations still exhibit useful scaling properties that make them attractive for applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It makes possible visualization of the molecular architecture of complex viruses, organelles and cells at a resolution of a few nanometres. In the last decade ET has allowed major breakthroughs that have provided exciting insights into a wide range of biological processes. In ET the biological sample is imaged with an electron microscope, and a series of images is taken from the sample at different views. Prior to imaging, the sample has to be specially prepared to withstand the conditions within the microscope. Subsequently, those images are processed and combined to yield the three-dimensional reconstruction or tomogram. Afterwards, a number of computational steps are necessary to facilitate the interpretation of the tomogram, such as noise reduction, segmentation and analysis of subvolumes. As the computational demands are huge in some of the stages, high performance computing (HPC) techniques are used to make the problem affordable in reasonable time. This article intends to comprehensively review the methods, technologies and tools involved in the different computational stages behind structural studies by Er, from image acquisition to interpretation of tomograms. The HPC techniques usually employed to cope with the computational demands are also briefly described. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The technological development, and in particular the high throughput technologies, have allowed researchers to inquire more deeply into the nature of the disease through the comparative study of large numbers of samples. The classification of breast cancer by traditional parameters has been joined by rankings based on gene expression. Among the most popular platforms are MammaPrint (R), Oncotype DX (R) the wound-response model, the rate of two genes model, the genomic grade index and the intrinsic subtype model. The latter one provides the amplest biological information and allows for the classification of breast cancer into six intrinsic subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, normal breast and claudin-low. These new classifications are not yet fully applicable to clinical practice not only because they have not been standardized, but also because they entail a substantial economic outlay. Nevertheless, they have provided valuable information on tumor biology that has led to a better understanding of the signaling pathways governing the processes of formation, maintenance and expansion of the tumors. Researchers now know more about the HER2, estrogen receptor, IGF1R, PI3K/AKT, mTOR, AMPK and angiogenesis pathways which has allowed for the development of new targeted therapeutics now being tested in ongoing clinical trials.In general, one can say that the last decade has changed the way researchers understand, classify and study breast cancer, and it has reshaped the way doctors diagnose and treat this disease. In addition, it has undoubtedly changed the search for alternative therapies by integrating molecular studies and the selection of study populations based on their molecular markers into clinical trials. The present review summarizes the advances that have allowed researchers to both better classify the disease, as well as explore some of the most important signaling pathways. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this environment, a gradient of oxygen tension, from normoxia to hypoxia results in different levels of ROS, impacting cellular physiology.

However, MMP-2 also localizes to intracellular compartments and the cytosol where it has several substrates, including troponin I (TnI). Despite a growing list of cytosolic substrates, we currently do not know the mechanism(s) that give rise to the equilibrium between intracellular and secreted MMP-2 moieties. Therefore, we explored how cells achieve the unique distribution of this protease. Our data show that endogenous MMP-2 targets inefficiently to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and shows significant amounts in the cytosol. Transfection of canonical MMP-2 essentially reproduces this targeting pattern, suggesting it is the quality of the MMP-2 signal sequence that predominantly determines MMP-2 targeting. However, we also found that human cardiomyocytes express an MMP-2 splice variant which entirely lacks the signal sequence. Like the fraction of ER-excluded, full-length MMP-2, this variant MMP-2 is restricted to the cytosol and specifically enhances TnI cleavage upon hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in cardiomyocytes. Together, our findings describe for the first time a set of mechanisms that cells utilize to equilibrate MMP-2 both in the extracellular milieu and intracellular, cytosolic locations. Our results also suggest approaches to specifically investigate the overlooked intracellular biology of MMP-2. J. Cell. Physiol. 227: 33973404, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, ME has been largely overlooked in the thermal biology literature, which can be explained by the fact that thermotolerance estimates often involve the collapse or death of the tested individuals and measurements cannot be repeated in vivo with the same specimen under identical conditions. Here we assess inter- and intra-researcher (test-retest) reliability of heat tolerance measured as knockdown time from digital recordings of Drosophila subobscura flies individually assayed in vials with a dynamic method. We provide a summary of various estimators used to compute measurement reliability (the degree to which the measurement is affected by ME) together with their statistical properties. Our results indicate that the estimation of heat knockdown time has poor reliability: intra-researcher ME=29% and inter-researcher ME=34%. This difference is attributed to lack of 'accurateness' (the difference in the marginal distributions of the measurements taken by the two researchers) because measurement imprecision was essentially the same in both estimates (27%). In view of our results we conclude that thermal biologists should report the reliability of thermotolerance estimates and, when necessary, adopt some straightforward guidelines suggested here to improve measurement reliability.

However, the roles of rhetoric and argumentation in those documents have received relatively little scientific attention. We studied 111 expert documents in support of reintroductions to Scotland and identified the elements that constituted the discourses of white-tailed eagle, beaver and lynx. Similar building blocks (so-called storylines) were found in all three debates. The pro-reintroduction discourse as a whole bore resemblance with other contemporary environmental management discourses: In what could be termed 'win-win logic', positive storylines were combined to point at the necessity of a management intervention, in our case a reintroduction. Yet, additional mechanisms were also at work which suggests that downplaying negatives can be as important as dwelling on positives. Crucially, we found that the Scottish pro-reintroduction discourse might have become increasingly 'reflexive' in terms of its rhetoric and argumentation. The latter development may have major implications for political decision-making. A more critical use of rhetoric and argumentation in expert documentation is needed to achieve environmental political decision-making that is open to any possible outcome of deliberation (including non-reintroduction).

Systematic assessments of the risks associated with exposure to nanoparticles are needed. DNA microarrays have emerged as a powerful tool for toxicology research. Microarraybased toxicogenomics research provides valuable information for understanding underling mechanisms of toxicological behavior of non-classic contaminants, including ultrafine nanoparticles. In this work, we investigated the effect of nano-titanium oxide exposure on human cells by analyzing the change in transcription levels of cellular DNA. Cross-experimental analysis of heterogeneous gene expression datasets was performed using the RankProd algorithm. Multiple gene expression omnibus series obtained from various experimental conditions were combined and used for risk assessment. Several commonly regulated genes were identified as being unaffected by the laboratory specific conditions. Pathway analysis revealed the genes as being associated with six major pathways: arachidonic acid metabolism, purine metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, and methionine metabolism. The identified differently expressed genes provide a robust set of markers for exposure analysis and risk assessment of titanium oxide nanoparticles.

The fluorescence response of the CuQNE was specific for NO, the presence of other reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) did not interfere with the detection of NO in aqueous solution. LC-MS and IR spectra of the reaction mixture both demonstrated that the fluorescence enhancement was possibly attributed to an NO-induced nitrosation of the amino group.

Thus, extreme heat and cold are detrimental to development and survival, while, within tolerable limits, increasing temperatures generally accelerate development but increase mortality. Moisture is needed for development and translation of larvae from faeces to pasture, and so rainfall is a limiting factor for transmission. Together, these factors underpin seasonal patterns of infection in sheep, as well as geographic variation in the epidemiology and relative importance of different species within Europe. Local knowledge and experience enable treatment to be targeted appropriately to prevent dangerous levels of infection. This traditional know-how can be supplemented by predictive epidemiological models, built on thorough understanding of the influence of climate on larval availability. However, management also has a dominant role in determining patterns of infection, and is itself influenced by climate. Current geographic variation in nematode epidemiology across Europe, and knowledge of systems from outside Europe, can provide only limited perspectives on the likely effects of climate change on disease in future. This is because disease arises from complex interaction between host and parasite factors, and the implementation of optimal control strategies to meet new challenges will be slowed by the inertia of current systems. Approaches to nematode control must therefore take account not only of parasite biology, but also the forces that shape sheep farming systems and management decisions.

However, most high-throughput methods to measure the dynamics of gene expression do not preserve the detailed spatial information needed in this context. For this reason, quantification methods based on image bioinformatics have become increasingly important over the past few years. Most available approaches in this field either focus on the detailed and accurate quantification of a small set of gene expression patterns, or attempt high-throughput analysis of spatial expression through binary pattern extraction and large-scale analysis of the resulting datasets. Here we present a robust, ""medium-throughput"" pipeline to process in situ hybridisation patterns from embryos of different species of flies. It bridges the gap between high-resolution, and high-throughput image processing methods, enabling us to quantify graded expression patterns along the anteroposterior axis of the embryo in an efficient and straightforward manner. Our method is based on a robust enzymatic (colorimetric) in situ hybridisation protocol and rapid data acquisition through wide-field microscopy. Data processing consists of image segmentation, profile extraction, and determination of expression domain boundary positions using a spline approximation. It results in sets of measured boundaries sorted by gene and developmental time point, which are analysed in terms of expression variability or spatio-temporal dynamics. Our method yields integrated time series of spatial gene expression, which can be used to reverse-engineer developmental gene regulatory networks across species. It is easily adaptable to other processes and species, enabling the in silico reconstitution of gene regulatory networks in a wide range of developmental contexts.

Here we tested whether the important regulators of E-cadherin expression SNAI1 and TWIST1 are already detectable in human colorectal adenomas.Methods: RNA was extracted from a set of randomly selected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal adenomas (n = 41) and normal colon mucosa (n = 10). Subsequently mRNA expression of CDH1, CDH2, SNAI1 and TWIST1 was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. CDH1 as well as SNAI1 protein expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results: SNAI1 mRNA was expressed in 78% (n = 32/41), TWIST1 mRNA in 41% (n = 17/41) and CDH2 mRNA in 41% (n = 17/41) of the colorectal adenoma tissue, while normal colon mucosa was negative for these transcription factors. We found a significant correlation between reduced CDH1 and the presence of SNAI1 mRNA expression and for combined SNAI1 and TWIST1 mRNA expression, respectively. A correlation between CDH2 mRNA expression and reduced CDH1 expression was not observed. We confirmed the relationship between SNAI1 expression and reduced E-cadherin expression on the protein level via IHC.Conclusion: Our data show that SNAI1 and Twist1 are already expressed in benign precursor lesions of colorectal cancer and that SNAI1 expression was significantly correlated with lower expression of CDH1. Whether these findings reflect true EMT and/or are a sign of a more aggressive biology need to be investigated in further studies.

PSP encounters two difficult obstacles: the inaccurate energy function problem and the searching problem. Even if the lowest energy has been luckily found by the searching procedure, the correct protein structures are not guaranteed to obtain.Results: A general parallel metaheuristic approach is presented to tackle the above two problems. Multi-energy functions are employed to simultaneously guide the parallel searching threads. Searching trajectories are in fact controlled by the parameters of heuristic algorithms. The parallel approach allows the parameters to be perturbed during the searching threads are running in parallel, while each thread is searching the lowest energy value determined by an individual energy function. By hybridizing the intelligences of parallel ant colonies and Monte Carlo Metropolis search, this paper demonstrates an implementation of our parallel approach for PSP. 16 classical instances were tested to show that the parallel approach is competitive for solving PSP problem.Conclusions: This parallel approach combines various sources of both searching intelligences and energy functions, and thus predicts protein conformations with good quality jointly determined by all the parallel searching threads and energy functions. It provides a framework to combine different searching intelligence embedded in heuristic algorithms. It also constructs a container to hybridize different not-so-accurate objective functions which are usually derived from the domain expertise.

Intriguingly, a recurring somatic mutation in the transcription factor Forkhead Box L2 (FOXL2) 402C>G has been found in nearly all GCTs examined. This investigation aims to identify the pathogenicity of mutant FOXL2 by studying its altered transcriptional targets.Methods: The expression of mutant FOXL2 was reduced in the GCT cell line KGN, and wildtype and mutant FOXL2 were overexpressed in the GCT cell line COV434. Total RNA was hybridised to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 microarrays. Comparisons were made between the transcriptomes of control cells and cells altered by FOXL2 knockdown and overexpression, to detect potential transcriptional targets of mutant FOXL2.Results: The overexpression of wildtype and mutant FOXL2 in COV434, and the silencing of mutant FOXL2 expression in KGN, has shown that mutant FOXL2 is able to differentially regulate the expression of many genes, including two well known FOXL2 targets, StAR and CYP19A. We have shown that many of the genes regulated by mutant FOXL2 are clustered into functional annotations of cell death, proliferation, and tumourigenesis. Furthermore, TGF-beta signalling was found to be enriched when using the gene annotation tools GATHER and GeneSetDB. This enrichment was still significant after performing a robust permutation analysis.Conclusion: Given that many of the transcriptional targets of mutant FOXL2 are known TGF-beta signalling genes, we suggest that deregulation of this key antiproliferative pathway is one way mutant FOXL2 contributes to the pathogenesis of adult-type GCTs. We believe this pathway should be a target for future therapeutic interventions, if outcomes for women with GCTs are to improve.

Studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have uncovered a plethora of genetic regulators and effectors responsible for surviving pathogens. However, comparative studies utilizing other free-living nematodes and therefore providing an insight into the evolution of innate immunity have been lacking. Here, we take a systems biology approach and use whole genome microarrays to profile the transcriptional response of C. elegans and the necromenic nematode Pristionchus pacificus after exposure to the four different pathogens Serratia marcescens, Xenorhabdus nematophila, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus thuringiensis DB27. C. elegans is susceptible to all four pathogens whilst P. pacificus is only susceptible to S. marcescens and X. nematophila. We show an unexpected level of specificity in host responses to distinct pathogens within and across species, revealing an enormous complexity of effectors of innate immunity. Functional domains enriched in the transcriptomes on different pathogens are similar within a nematode species but different across them, suggesting differences in pathogen sensing and response networks. We find translation inhibition to be a potentially conserved response to gram-negative pathogens in both the nematodes. Further computational analysis indicates that both nematodes when fed on pathogens up-regulate genes known to be involved in other stress responses like heat shock, oxidative and osmotic stress, and genes regulated by DAF-16/FOXO and TGF-beta pathways. This study presents a platform for comparative systems analysis of two nematode model species, and a catalog of genes involved in the evolution of nematode immunity and identifies both pathogen specific and pan-pathogen responses. We discuss the potential effects of ecology on evolution of downstream effectors and upstream regulators on evolution of nematode innate immunity.

A major challenge of systems biology is to describe biological systems as a computational model, which can be used to derive novel hypothesis and drive experiments leading to new knowledge. The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis approach has been successfully applied to metabolism and to the macromolecular synthesis machinery assembly. Here, we present the first integrated stoichiometric multiscale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis for Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, which describes the sequence-specific synthesis and function of almost 2000 gene products at molecular detail. We added linear constraints, which couple enzyme synthesis and catalysis reactions. Comparison with experimental data showed improvement of growth phenotype prediction with the multiscale model over E. coli's metabolic model alone. Many of the genes covered by this integrated model are well conserved across enterobacters and other, less related bacteria. We addressed the question of whether the bias in synonymous codon usage could affect the growth phenotype and environmental niches that an organism can occupy. We created two classes of in silico strains, one with more biased codon usage and one with more equilibrated codon usage than the wildtype. The reduced growth phenotype in biased strains was caused by tRNA supply shortage, indicating that expansion of tRNA gene content or tRNA codon recognition allow E. coli to respond to changes in codon usage bias. Our analysis suggests that in order to maximize growth and to adapt to new environmental niches, codon usage and tRNA content must co-evolve. These results provide further evidence for the mutation-selection-drift balance theory of codon usage bias. This integrated multiscale reconstruction successfully demonstrates that the constraint-based modeling approach is well suited to whole-cell modeling endeavors.

Escherichia coli cell killing by nuclease colicins occurs through DNA (DNases) or RNA (RNases) hydrolysis and to this end their cytotoxic domains require transportation across two sets of membranes. In order to begin to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the membrane translocation of colicin nuclease domains, we have analysed the membrane association of four DNase domains (E9, a charge reduction E9 mutant, E8, and E7) and one ribosomal RNase domain (E3) using a biomembrane model system.Principal Results: We demonstrate, through the use of large unilamellar vesicles composed of synthetic and E. coli lipids and a membrane surface potential sensor, that the colicin nuclease domains bind anionic membranes only, with micromolar affinity and via a cooperative binding mechanism. The evaluation of the nuclease bilayer insertion depth, through a fluorescence quenching analysis using brominated lipids, indicates that the nucleases locate to differential regions in the bilayer. Colicin DNases target the interfacial region of the lipid bilayer, with the DNase E7 showing the deepest insertion, whereas the ribosomal RNase E3 penetrates into the hydrophobic core region of the bilayer. Furthermore, the membrane association of the DNase E7 and the ribosomal RNase E3 induces vesicle aggregation, lipid mixing and content leakage to a much larger extent than that of the other DNases analysed.Conclusions/Significance: Our results show, for the first time, that after the initial electrostatically driven membrane association, the pleiotropic membrane effects induced by colicin nuclease domains relate to their bilayer insertion depth and may be linked to their in vivo membrane translocation.

Syndrome differentiation is the foundation and essence of TCM theories. The aims of the study are to discriminate T2DM corresponding to different syndromes (Qi-deficiency, Qi and Yin-deficiency and Damp heat) and discover syndrome-related biomarkers using metabolomics technology.Materials and methods: Plasma fatty acid profiles of 85 clinical samples were established by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Moreover, some of the lipid parameters, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), were obtained through clinical testing methods. Orthogonal signal correction-partial least squares (OSC-PLS) and uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis (ULDA) were employed to establish two-class models for three different syndromes.Results: Compared with the plasma fatty acid profiles of healthy controls, the characteristic fatty acids of three TCM syndromes were discovered (p < 0.01). Totally, the plasma fatty acids of T2DM were up-regulated, while significant differences existed in different syndromes. Results of ULDA indicate that the three TCM syndromes could be effectively separated by the plasma fatty acid profiles and the syndrome-related biomarkers were also screened.Conclusions: The fact that three TCM syndromes can be separated indicates certain metabolic differences in different TCM syndromes of T2DM really exist and such differences can be manifested by fatty acids and lipid parameters. The results benefit modern biological interpretation of the three TCM syndromes and in a sense the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Entomological investigations were carried out in a tribal forested area of district Bastar located in the southern part of Chhattisgarh state to record the prevalence of sibling species of Anopheles fluviatilis and An. culicifacies complexes. The vector species complexes were investigated at sibling species level for their biology in terms of resting and feeding behavior and malaria transmission potential.Methods: Indoor resting vector mosquitoes collected during 2010-2011 were identified to sibling species by cytotaxonomy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The blood meal source analysis and incrimination studies were done at sibling species level by counter current immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively.Results: Analysis of sibling species composition revealed predominance of An. fluviatilis species S in the study area, which was found to be highly anthropophagic and rested in human dwellings whereas the sympatric species T was primarily zoophagic. Incrimination studies showed high sporozoite rate in species S, thereby confirming its vectorial efficiency. An. culicifacies was encountered in low numbers and comprised species B and C in almost equal proportion. Both these species were found to be exclusively zoophagic.Conclusion: The observations made strongly suggest that species S of Fluviatilis Complex is the principal vector of malaria in certain forest areas of district Bastar, Chhattisgarh state and should be the target species for vector control operation. Vector control strategies based on biological characteristics of Fluviatilis S will lead to substantial decline in malaria incidence in such areas.

The mean pathological scores for pancreatic tissues in the MT group were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than those for samples in the SO group (1.088 +/- 0.187 vs 0.488 +/- 0.183 after 1 h; 2.450 +/- 0.212 vs 0.469 +/- 0.242 after 4 h; 4.994 +/- 0.184 vs 0.513 +/- 0.210 after 8 h), but were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those for samples in the SAP group at each time point (1.088 +/- 0.187 vs 1.969 +/- 0.290 after 1 h; 2.450 +/- 0.212 vs 3.344 +/- 0.386 after 4 h; 4.994 +/- 0.184 vs 6.981 +/- 0.301 after 8 h). The severity of SAP increased significantly (P < 0.01) over time in the SAP group (1.088 +/- 0.187 vs 2.450 +/- 0.212 between 1 h and 4 h after inducing pancreatitis; and 2.450 +/- 0.212 vs 4.994 +/- 0.184 between 4 and 8 h after inducing pancreatitis).CONCLUSION: Melatonin protects rats against acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury, probably through the upregulation of IL-22 and Th22, which increases the innate immunity of tissue cells and enhances their regeneration.

These receptors eluded structural characterization for decades following their identification. A landmark structure of rhodopsin provided a basis for structure-function studies and homology modeling, but advances in receptor biology suffered from a lack of receptor-specific structural insights. The recent explosion in GPCR structures confirms some features predicted by rhodopsin-based models, and more importantly, it reveals unexpected ligand-binding modes and critical aspects of the receptor activation process. The new structures also promise to foster studies testing emerging models for GPCR function such as receptor dimerization and ligand-biased signaling.

No principle yet unifies Myc action due partly to an incomplete inventory and functional accounting of Myc's targets. To observe Myc target expression and function in a system where Myc is temporally and physiologically regulated, the transcriptomes and the genome-wide distributions of Myc, RNA polymerase II, and chromatin modifications were compared during lymphocyte activation and in ES cells as well. A remarkably simple rule emerged from this quantitative analysis: Myc is not an on-off specifier of gene activity, but is a nonlinear amplifier of expression, acting universally at active genes, except for immediate early genes that are strongly induced before Myc. This rule of Myc action explains the vast majority of Myc biology observed in literature.

The M18AAP of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a metallo-aminopeptidase that we show demonstrates a highly restricted specificity for peptides with an N-terminal Glu or Asp residue. Thus, the enzyme may function alongside other aminopeptidases in effecting the complete degradation or turnover of proteins, such as host hemoglobin, which provides a free amino acid pool for the growing parasite. Inhibition of PfM18AAP's function using antisense RNA is detrimental to the intra-erythrocytic malaria parasite and, hence, it has been proposed as a potential novel drug target. We report the X-ray crystal structure of the PfM18AAP aminopeptidase and reveal its complex dodecameric assembly arranged via dimer and trimer units that interact to form a large tetrahedron shape that completely encloses the 12 active sites within a central cavity. The four entry points to the catalytic lumen are each guarded by 12 large flexible loops that could control substrate entry into the catalytic sites. PfM18AAP thus resembles a proteasomal-like machine with multiple active sites able to degrade peptide substrates that enter the central lumen. The Plasmodium enzyme shows significant structural differences around the active site when compared to recently determined structures of its mammalian and human homologs, which provides a platform from which a rational approach to inhibitor design of new malaria-specific drugs can begin.

Here, we begin to address whether the study of LZTs can shed light on the biology of prion proteins in health and disease. Starting from an observation of an abnormal LZT immunoreactive band in prion-infected mice, subsequent cell biological analyses uncovered a surprisingly coordinated biology of ZIP10 (an LZT member) and prion proteins that involves alterations to N-glycosylation and endoproteolysis in response to manipulations to the extracellular divalent cation milieu. Starving cells of manganese or zinc, but not copper, causes shedding of the N1 fragment of PrPC and of the ectodomain of ZIP10. For ZIP10, this posttranslational biology is influenced by an interaction between its PrP-like ectodomain and a conserved metal coordination site within its C-terminal multi-spanning transmembrane domain. The transition metal starvation-induced cleavage of ZIP10 can be differentiated by an immature N-glycosylation signature from a constitutive cleavage targeting the same site. Data from this work provide a first glimpse into a hitherto neglected molecular biology that ties PrP to its LZT cousins and suggest that manganese or zinc starvation may contribute to the etiology of prion disease in mice.

Although remarkably robust in vivo, cellular identities can be manipulated using experimental techniques. Lineage reprogramming is an emerging field at the intersection of developmental and stem cell biology in which a somatic cell is stably reprogrammed into a distinct cell type by forced expression of lineage-determining factors. Lineage reprogramming enables the direct conversion of readily available cells from patients (such as skin fibroblasts) into disease-relevant cell types (such as neurons and cardiomyocytes) or into induced pluripotent stem cells. Although remarkable progress has been made in developing novel reprogramming methods, the efficiency and fidelity of reprogramming need to be improved in order increase the experimental and translational utility of reprogrammed cells. Studying the mechanisms that prevent successful reprogramming should allow for improvements in reprogramming methods, which could have significant implications for regenerative medicine and the study of human disease. Furthermore, lineage reprogramming has the potential to become a powerful system for dissecting the mechanisms that underlie cell fate establishment and terminal differentiation processes. In this review, we will discuss how transcription factors interface with the genome and induce changes in cellular identity in the context of development and reprogramming.

Two branches of piRNA biogenesis, namely primary processing and ping-pong amplification, have been proposed. Despite an overall conceptual understanding of piRNA biogenesis, identity and/or function of the involved players are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for the female sterility gene shutdown in piRNA biology. Shutdown, an evolutionarily conserved cochaperone collaborates with Hsp90 during piRNA biogenesis, potentially at the loading step of RNAs into PIWI proteins. We demonstrate that Shutdown is essential for both primary and secondary piRNA populations in Drosophila. An extension of our study to previously described piRNA pathway members revealed three distinct groups of biogenesis factors. Together with data on how PIWI proteins are wired into primary and secondary processing, we propose a unified model for piRNA biogenesis.

Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is one of the most useful tools for nanopatterning of flat surfaces. However, these patterns are usually built on homogeneous surfaces and require chemical functionalization to ensure specific affinity. Layered magnesium-aluminum hydroxide-silicates have already shown unique self-assembly properties on DNA molecules, due to their peculiar crystal chemistry based on alternating positive and negative crystal layers. However, patterns on these surfaces tend to be randomly organized. Here we show etching and oxidation at the nanometer scale of magnesium-aluminum hydroxide-silicates using the same SPM probe for the creation of organized nanopatterns. In particular, it is possible to produce three-dimensional structures in a reproducible way, with a depth resolution of 0.4 nm, lateral resolution of tens of nm, and a speed of about 10 mu m s(-1). We report, as an example, the construction of an atomically flat charged pattern, designed to guide DNA deposition along predetermined directions without the need of any chemical functionalization of the surface.

A number of studies on biogeographic gradients are available for terrestrial ecosystems, but freshwater ecosystems remain largely neglected. In particular, we know very little about the species richness gradients and their drivers in the Himalaya, a global biodiversity hotspot.Methodology/Principal Findings: We collated taxonomic and distribution data of fish species from 16 freshwater Himalayan rivers and carried out empirical studies on environmental drivers and fish diversity and distribution in the Teesta river (Eastern Himalaya). We examined patterns of fish species richness along the Himalayan elevational gradients (50-3800 m) and sought to understand the drivers behind the emerging patterns. We used generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM) to examine the richness patterns; GLM was used to investigate relationship between fish species richness and various environmental variables. Regression modelling involved stepwise procedures, including elimination of collinear variables, best model selection, based on the least Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the highest percentage of deviance explained (D-2). This maiden study on the Himalayan fishes revealed that total and non-endemic fish species richness monotonously decrease with increasing elevation, while endemics peaked around mid elevations (700-1500 m). The best explanatory model (synthetic model) indicated that water discharge is the best predictor of fish species richness patterns in the Himalayan rivers.Conclusions/Significance: This study, carried out along one of the longest bioclimatic elevation gradients of the world, lends support to Rapoport's elevational rule as opposed to mid domain effect hypothesis. We propose a species-discharge model and contradict species-area model in predicting fish species richness. We suggest that drivers of richness gradients in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are likely to be different. These studies are crucial in context of the impacts of unprecedented on-going river regulation on fish diversity and distribution in the Himalaya.

HIF-1 is known to facilitate recruitment and differentiation of multipotent human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC). Therefore, we analyzed the impact of hypoxia and HIF-1 on the competitive differentiation potential of hMSCs towards adipogenic and osteogenic lineages.Methodology/Principal Findings: Bone marrow derived primary hMSCs cultured for 2 weeks either under normoxic (app. 18% O-2) or hypoxic (less than 2% O-2) conditions were analyzed for the expression of MSC surface markers and for expression of the genes HIF1A, VEGFA, LDHA, PGK1, and GLUT1. Using conditioned medium, adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation as verified by Oil-Red-O or von-Kossa staining was induced in hMSCs under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The expression of HIF1A and VEGFA was measured by qPCR. A knockdown of HIF-1 alpha by lentiviral transduction was performed, and the ability of the transduced hMSCs to differentiate into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages was analyzed. Hypoxia induced HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 target gene expression, but did not alter MSC phenotype or surface marker expression. Hypoxia (i) suppressed adipogenesis and associated HIF1A and PPARG gene expression in hMSCs and (ii) enhanced osteogenesis and associated HIF1A and RUNX2 gene expression. shRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1 alpha enhanced adipogenesis under both normoxia and hypoxia, and suppressed hypoxia-induced osteogenesis.Conclusions/Significance: Hypoxia promotes osteogenesis but suppresses adipogenesis of human MSCs in a competitive and HIF-1-dependent manner. We therefore conclude that the effects of hypoxia are crucial for effective bone healing, which may potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

However, the respective roles of hosts and Symbiodinium in this endosymbiotic association, particularly in response to environmental challenges (e.g., high sea surface temperatures), remain unsettled. One of the key obstacles is to produce and maintain aposymbiotic coral hosts for experimental purposes. In this study, a simple and gentle protocol to generate aposymbiotic coral hosts (Isopora palifera and Stylophora pistillata) was developed using repeated incubation in menthol/artificial seawater (ASW) medium under light and in ASW in darkness, which depleted more than 99% of Symbiodinium from the host within 4,8 days. As indicated by the respiration rate, energy metabolism (by malate dehydrogenase activity), and nitrogen metabolism (by glutamate dehydrogenase activity and profiles of free amino acids), the physiological and biochemical performances of the menthol-induced aposymbiotic corals were comparable to their symbiotic counterparts without nutrient supplementation (e.g., for Stylophora) or with a nutrient supplement containing glycerol, vitamins, and a host mimic of free amino acid mixture (e.g., for Isopora). Differences in biochemical responses to menthol-induced bleaching between Stylophora and Isopora were attributed to the former digesting Symbiodinium rather than expelling the algae live as found in the latter species. Our studies showed that menthol could successfully bleach corals and provided aposymbiotic corals for further exploration of coral-alga symbioses.

Both relaxometry and diffusometry experiments were performed, so that three different parameters are reported: spin-spin relaxation rates of non-water protons (1/T-2,T-ne), spin-spin relaxation rates of water protons (1/T-2,T-e+w), and water self-diffusion coefficients (D-w).

However, relationships between dimer stability and interfacial residue identity are not fully understood. In the context of the ""knobs-into-holes"" (KIH) packing pattern, one can identify two classes of interactions between side chains from different helices: ""lateral"", in which a line connecting the adjacent side chains is perpendicular to the helix axes, and ""vertical"", in which the connecting line is parallel to the helix axes. We have previously analyzed vertical interactions in antiparallel coiled coils and found that one type of triad constellation (a'-a-a') exerts a strong effect on pairing preferences, while the other type of triad (d'-d-d') has relatively little impact on pairing tendencies. Here, we ask whether vertical interactions (d'-a-d') influence pairing in parallel coiled-coil dimers. Our results indicate that vertical interactions can exert a substantial impact on pairing specificity, and that the influence of the d'-a-d' triad depends on the lateral a' contact within the local KIH motif.

In the present study we examined the impact of CAV1 deficiency on the properties of mouse adipose tissue both in vivo and in explant cultures during conditions of metabolic stress. In CAV1(-/-) mice fasting caused loss of adipose tissue mass despite a lack of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation. In addition, fasting resulted in increased macrophage infiltration, enhanced deposition of collagen, and a reduction in the level of the lipid droplet protein perilipin A (PLIN1a). Explant cultures of CAV1(-/-) adipose tissue also showed a loss of PLIN1a during culture, enhanced secretion of IL-6, increased release of lactate dehydrogenase, and demonstrated increased susceptibility to cell death upon collagenase treatment. Attenuated PKA-mediated signaling to HSL, loss of PLIN1a and increased secretion of IL-6 were also observed in adipose tissue explants of CAV1(+/+) mice with diet-induced obesity. Together these results suggest that while alterations in adipocyte lipid droplet biology support adipose tissue metabolism in the absence of PKA-mediated pro-lipolytic signaling in CAV1(-/-) mice, the tissue is intrinsically unstable resulting in increased susceptibility to cell death, which we suggest underlies the development of fibrosis and inflammation during periods of metabolic stress.

Recently published data indicate that the few Wolbachia-free species in these subfamilies were infected in the distant past and have subsequently shed their endosymbionts. We used an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of Onchocerca flexuosa to explore the molecular mechanisms that allow worms of this species to survive without a bacterial partner. Roche/454 sequencing of the adult transcriptome produced 16,814 isogroup and 47,252 singleton sequences that are estimated to represent approximately 41% of the complete gene set. Sequences similar to 97 Wolbachia genes were identified from the transcriptome, some of which appear on the same transcripts as sequences similar to nematode genes. Computationally predicted peptides, including those with similarity to Wolbachia proteins, were classified at the domain and pathway levels in order to assess the metabolic capabilities of O. flexuosa and compare against the Wolbachia-dependent model filaria, Brugia malayi. Transcript data further facilitated a shotgun proteomic analysis of O. flexuosa adult worm lysate, resulting in the identification of 1,803 proteins.

Collagen synthesis and secretion is the major function of OBs and is markedly up-regulated upon ascorbic acid (AA) stimulation, significantly more so than in fibroblast cells. Understanding the mechanism by which collagen is mobilized in specialized OB cells is important for both basic cell biology and diseases involving defects in bone protein secretion and deposition. Protein trafficking along the exocytic and endocytic pathways is aided by many molecules, with Rab GTPases being master regulators of vesicle targeting. In this study, we used microarray analysis to identify the Rab GTPases that are up-regulated during a 5-day AA differentiation of OBs, namely Rab1, Rab3d, and Rab27b. Further, we investigated the role of identified Rabs in regulating the trafficking of collagen from the site of synthesis in the ER to the Golgi and ultimately to the plasma membrane utilizing Rab dominant negative (DN) expression. We also observed that experimental halting of biosynthetic trafficking by these mutant Rabs initiated proteasome-mediated degradation of procollagen and ceased global protein translation. Acute expression of Rab1 and Rab3d DN constructs partially alleviated this negative feedback mechanism and resulted in impaired ER to Golgi trafficking of procollagen. Similar expression of Rab27b DN constructs resulted in dispersed collagen vesicles which may represent failed secretory vesicles sequestered in the cytosol. A significant and strong reduction in extracellular collagen levels was also observed implicating the functional importance of Rab1, Rab3d and Rab27b in these major collagen-producing cells.

So are the gene networks and transcription factors (TF) responsible for the differential structure and function of each particular tissue, and this is particularly true for non model species with incomplete genomic resources. To better understand the regulation of genes responsible for tissue identity in pigs, we have inferred regulatory networks from a meta-analysis of 20 gene expression studies spanning 480 Porcine Affymetrix chips for 134 experimental conditions on 27 distinct tissues. We developed a mixed-model normalization approach with a covariance structure that accommodated the disparity in the origin of the individual studies, and obtained the normalized expression of 12,320 genes across the 27 tissues. Using this resource, we constructed a network, based on the co-expression patterns of 1,072 TF and 1,232 tissue specific genes. The resulting network is consistent with the known biology of tissue development. Within the network, genes clustered by tissue and tissues clustered by site of embryonic origin. These clusters were significantly enriched for genes annotated in key relevant biological processes and confirm gene functions and interactions from the literature. We implemented a Regulatory Impact Factor (RIF) metric to identify the key regulators in skeletal muscle and tissues from the central nervous systems. The normalization of the meta-analysis, the inference of the gene co-expression network and the RIF metric, operated synergistically towards a successful search for tissue-specific regulators. Novel among these findings are evidence suggesting a novel key role of ERCC3 as a muscle regulator.

Here, the ability of the ROC domain of another human ROCO protein, Death Associated Protein Kinase 1 (DAPK1), to bind GTP and control its kinase activity has been evaluated. In contrast to LRRK2, loss of GTP binding by DAPK1 does not result in loss of kinase activity, instead acting to modulate this activity.

It is linked to many other phenomena in physics, chemistry and biology and has numerous practical applications. Due to limitations of the analytical tools usually used, studies of adsorption are limited to the particle sizes of up to similar to 10(2)-10(3) atoms. Following a general formalism developed in this field, we apply it to even larger objects and discover qualitatively new phenomena. A large particle is bound to the surface in a deep and broad potential well formed by van der Waals/Casimir-Polder forces appearing due to the particle and surface electric polarization. The well depth is significantly larger than the characteristic energy 3/2k(B)T of a particle's thermal motion; thus such a nanoparticle is settled in long-living states. Nanoparticles in high-excited states form a two-dimensional gas of objects bound to the surface but quasi-freely traveling along the surface under certain conditions. A particularly interesting feature of this model consists in the prediction of small-energy-transfer inelastic scattering of ultracold neutrons (UCN) on solid/liquid surfaces covered by such levitating nanoparticles/nano-droplets. The change in UCN energy is due to the Doppler shift induced by UCN collisions with nanoparticles/nano-droplets; the energy change is almost as small as the UCN initial energy. We compared theoretical estimations of our model to all existing data on inelastic scattering of UCN with small energy transfers and found that they agree quite well. As our theoretical formalism provides robust predictions of some data and the experimental data are rather detailed and precise, we conclude that the recently discovered intriguing phenomenon of small heating of UCN in traps is due to their collisions with such levitating nanoparticles. Moreover, this new phenomenon might be relevant to the striking contradiction between the results of the neutron lifetime measurements and the smallest reported uncertainties, as it might cause major false effects in these experiments; thus, it affects fundamental conclusions concerning precision checks of unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, cosmology and astrophysics. Dedicated measurements of UCN inelastic scattering on specially prepared surfaces and nanoparticles/nano-droplets levitating above them might provide a unique method for studying surface potentials.

This process is commonly described by a model of diffusive hopping according to the semiclassical theories of Marcus and Hopfield. However, recent studies have raised the possibility that nontrivial quantum mechanical effects play a functioning role in certain biomolecular processes. Here, we investigate the potential effects of quantum coherence in biological ET by extending the semiclassical model to allow for the possibility of quantum coherent phenomena using a quantum master equation based on the Holstein Hamiltonian. We test the model on the structurally defined chain of seven iron-sulfur clusters in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide plus hydrogen: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), a crucial respiratory enzyme and one of the longest chains of metal centers in biology. Using experimental parameters where possible, we find that, in limited circumstances, a small quantum mechanical contribution can provide a marked increase in the ET rate above the semiclassical diffusive-hopping rate. Under typical biological conditions, our model reduces to well-known diffusive behavior.

The hatchlings of P. grumgrzimailoi need at least two years to reach sexual maturity, with the smallest mature male and female measured 48.02 mm and 47.01 mm snout-vent length (SVL), respectively. Adult females produce a single clutch per breeding season, with the clutch size ranging from 1 to 5. The clutch size and mass are significantly correlated with female SVL. There is no correlation of mean egg size with clutch size and relative fecundity in P. grumgrzimailoi, suggesting that the trade-off is absent between mean egg size and number. Females increase reproductive output mainly through increasing egg numbers. The copulation period lasts from April to June. Females begin vitellogenesis in April and lay eggs from May to July. Our results suggest that toad-headed lizards tend to select different reproductive strategies to adapt themselves to their arid or semi-arid habitats.

Telomere dynamics in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) are of particular interest in light of the emergence of devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), a transmissible malignancy that causes rapid mortality and threatens the species with extinction. We used fluorescent in situ hybridisation to investigate telomere length in DFTD cells, in healthy Tasmanian devils and in four closely related marsupial species. Here we report that animals in the Order Dasyuromorphia have chromosomes characterised by striking telomere length dimorphism between homologues. Findings in sex chromosomes suggest that telomere length dimorphism may be regulated by events in the parental germlines. Long telomeres on the Y chromosome imply that telomere lengthening occurs during spermatogenesis, whereas telomere diminution occurs during oogenesis. Although found in several somatic cell tissue types, telomere length dimorphism was not found in DFTD cancer cells, which are characterised by uniformly short telomeres. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of naturally occurring telomere length dimorphism in any species and suggests a novel strategy of telomere length control. Comparative studies in five distantly related marsupials and a monotreme indicate that telomere dimorphism evolved at least 50 million years ago.

Basal-like breast cancers are enriched for markers of breast cancer stem cells as well as markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While EMT is generally thought to be important in the process of metastasis, in vivo evidence of EMT in human disease remains rare. Here we report a novel model of human triple-negative breast cancer, the DKAT cell line, which was isolated from an aggressive, treatment-resistant triple-negative breast cancer that demonstrated morphological and biochemical evidence suggestive of phenotypic plasticity in the patient. The DKAT cell line displays a basal-like phenotype in vitro when cultured in serum-free media, and undergoes phenotypic changes consistent with EMT/MET in response to serum-containing media, a unique property among the breast cancer cell lines we tested. This EMT is marked by increased expression of the transcription factor Zeb1,and Zeb1 is required for the enhanced migratory ability of DKAT cells in the mesenchymal state. DKAT cells also express progenitor-cell markers, and single DKAT cells are able to generate tumorspheres containing both epithelial and mesenchymal cell types. In vivo, as few as ten DKAT cells are capable of forming xenograft tumors which display a range of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. The DKAT model provides a novel model to study the molecular mechanisms regulating phenotypic plasticity and the aggressive biology of triple-negative breast cancers.

It has two isoforms [long (HtrA3-L) and short (HtrA3-S)] and is important for placental development and cancer progression. Recently, HtrA3 was identified as a potential diagnostic marker for early detection of preeclampsia, a life-threatening pregnancy-specific disorder. Currently there are no high-throughput assays available to detect HtrA3 in human serum. In this study we generated and fully tested a panel of five HtrA3 mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Three mAbs recognised both HtrA3-L and HtrA3-S and the other two detected HtrA3-L only. All five mAbs were highly specific to HtrA3 and applicable in western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis of endogenous HtrA3 proteins in the mouse and human tissues. Amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assays-linked immunosorbent assays (AlphaLISAs), were developed to detect HtrA3 isoforms in picomolar levels in serum. The HtrA3 AlphaLISA detected significantly higher serum levels of HtrA3 in women at 13-14 weeks of gestation who subsequently developed preeclampsia compared to gestational-age matched controls. These HtrA3 mAbs are valuable for the development of immunoassays and characterisation of HtrA3 isoform-specific biology. The newly developed HtrA3 AlphaLISA assays are suitable for large scale screening of human serum.

For behavioral biologists, the ability to link variation in gene expression to the occurrence of specific behavioral traits has long been a largely unobtainable goal. Social interactions with conspecifics represent a fundamental component of the behavior of most animal species. Although several studies of mammals have attempted to uncover the genetic bases for social relationships using a candidate gene approach, none have attempted more comprehensive, transcriptome-based analyses using high throughout sequencing. As a first step toward improved understanding of the genetic underpinnings of mammalian sociality, we generated a reference transcriptome for the colonial tuco-tuco (Ctenomys sociabilis), a social species of subterranean rodent that is endemic to southwestern Argentina. Specifically, we analyzed over 500 million Illumina sequencing reads derived from the hippocampi of 10 colonial tuco-tucos housed in captivity under a variety of social conditions. The resulting reference transcriptome provides a critical tool for future studies aimed at exploring relationships between social environment and gene expression in this non-model species of social mammal.

This frequently leads to their death and huge socioeconomic losses, especially in developing countries. This parasite can also cause zoonotic infections in humans, but has been largely neglected due to a lack of diagnostic techniques and studies. Recent developments in next-generation sequencing provide an opportunity to explore the transcriptome of T. multiceps.Methodology/Principal Findings: We obtained a total of 31,282 unigenes (mean length 920 bp) using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology and a new Trinity de novo assembler without a referenced genome. Individual transcription molecules were determined by sequence-based annotations and/or domain-based annotations against public databases (Nr, UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot, COG, KEGG, UniProtKB/TrEMBL, InterPro and Pfam). We identified 26,110 (83.47%) unigenes and inferred 20,896 (66.8%) coding sequences (CDS). Further comparative transcripts analysis with other cestodes (Taenia pisiformis, Taenia solium, Echincoccus granulosus and Echincoccus multilocularis) and intestinal parasites (Trichinella spiralis, Ancylostoma caninum and Ascaris suum) showed that 5,100 common genes were shared among three Taenia tapeworms, 261 conserved genes were detected among five Taeniidae cestodes, and 109 common genes were found in four zoonotic intestinal parasites. Some of the common genes were genes required for parasite survival, involved in parasite-host interactions. In addition, we amplified two full-length CDS of unigenes from the common genes using RT-PCR.Conclusions/Significance: This study provides an extensive transcriptome of the adult stage of T. multiceps, and demonstrates that comparative transcriptomic investigations deserve to be further studied. This transcriptome dataset forms a substantial public information platform to achieve a fundamental understanding of the biology of T. multiceps, and helps in the identification of drug targets and parasite-host interaction studies.

A systematic literature review,"Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer. Progression- free and overall survival is significantly related to surgical success and residual disease volume. It is unclear whether this survival advantage is due to an intrinsic biological element of the tumour cells which enables successful surgery and improved prognosis, or alternatively the number of tumour sustaining cells remaining irrespective of differences in biology.METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed identifying studies that have investigated the association between biomarkers and surgical outcomes. We attempted validation of these results using The Cancer Genome Atlas ovarian cancer data sets.RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified of which sixteen determined protein expression, eight gene expression and one DNA methylation in association with surgical debulking. Individualised linear models adjusting for batch, stage and age identified only expression of the genes MTDH and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGFIR) to be significantly associated with debulking surgery (P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 5%), although in the case of IGFIR this was in the opposite direction to previous findings.CONCLUSION: The majority of studies are limited by design, include heterogeneous samples and lack adjustment for major confounding factors. High quality detailed clinical annotations should be routinely collected in future to more accurately evaluate biomarkers of surgical outcome.

Protein synthesis in aqueous environments, facilitated by sequential amino acid condensation forming peptides, is a ubiquitous process in modern biology, and a fundamental reaction necessary in prebiotic chemistry. Such reactions, however, are condensation reactions, requiring the elimination of a water molecule for every peptide bond formed, and are thus unfavorable in aqueous environments both from a thermodynamic and kinetic point of view. We use the hydrophobic environment of the air-water interface as a favorable venue for peptide bond synthesis, and demonstrate the occurrence of this chemistry with in situ techniques using Langmuir-trough methods and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy. Leucine ethyl ester (a small amino acid ester) first partitions to the water surface, then coordinates with Cu2+ ions at the interface, and subsequently undergoes a condensation reaction selectively forming peptide bonds at the air-water interface.

This shapes the output of signal responses as well as providing specificity and localization. The Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinases (MAGuKs) are scaffold proteins at cellular junctions that localize cell surface receptors and link them to downstream signaling enzymes. Scaffold proteins often contain protein-binding domains that are connected in series by disordered linkers. The tertiary structure of the folded domains is well understood, but describing the dynamic inter-domain interactions (the superteritary structure) of such multidomain proteins remains a challenge to structural biology. We used 65 distance restraints from single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to describe the superteritary structure of the canonical MAGuK scaffold protein PSD-95. By combining multiple fluorescence techniques, the conformational dynamics of PSD-95 could be characterized across the biologically relevant timescales for protein domain motions. Relying only on a qualitative interpretation of FRET data, we were able to distinguish stable interdomain interactions from freely orienting domains. This revealed that the five domains in PSD-95 partitioned into two independent supramodules: PDZ1-PDZ2 and PDZ3-SH3-GuK. We used our smFRET data for hybrid structural refinement to model the PDZ3-SH3-GuK supramodule and include explicit dye simulations to provide complete characterization of potential uncertainties inherent to quantitative interpretation of FRET as distance. Comparative structural analysis of synaptic MAGuK homologues showed a conservation of this supertertiary structure. Our approach represents a general solution to describing the supertertiary structure of multidomain proteins.

Villi first emerge at embryonic day (E) 14.5 from a previously flat luminal surface. Here, we analyze the cell biology of villus formation and examine the role of paracrine epithelial Hedgehog (Hh) signals in this process. We find that, before villus emergence, tight clusters of Hh-responsive mesenchymal cells form just beneath the epithelium. Cluster formation is dynamic; clusters first form dorsally and anteriorly and spread circumferentially and posteriorly. Statistical analysis of cluster distribution reveals a patterned array; with time, new clusters form in spaces between existing clusters, promoting approximately four rounds of villus emergence by E18.5. Cells within mesenchymal clusters express Patched1 and Gli1, as well as Pdgfr alpha, a receptor previously shown to participate in villus development. BrdU-labeling experiments show that clusters form by migration and aggregation of Hh-responsive cells. Inhibition of Hh signaling prevents cluster formation and villus development, but does not prevent emergence of villi in areas where clusters have already formed. Conversely, increasing Hh signaling increases the size of villus clusters and results in exceptionally wide villi. We conclude that Hh signals dictate the initial aspects of the formation of each villus by controlling mesenchymal cluster aggregation and regulating cluster size.

In our recent studies, we attempted to understand the early events of the conformational changes leading to PrPSc using as investigative tools point mutations clustered in the open reading frame of the human PrP gene and linked to genetic forms of human prion diseases. In the work presented here, we investigate the effect of pH on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of recombinant human PrP (HuPrP) carrying the pathological V210I mutation responsible for familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The NMR structure of HuPrP(V210I) determined at pH 7.2 shows the same overall fold as the previously determined structure of HuPrP(V210I) at pH 5.5. It consists of a disordered N-terminal tail (residues 90-124) and a globular C-terminal domain (residues 125-231) comprising three alpha-helices and a short antiparallel beta-sheet. Detailed comparison of three-dimensional structures of HuPrP(V210I) at pH 7.2 and 5.5 revealed significant local structural differences, with the most prominent pH-related structural variations clustered in the alpha(2)-alpha(3) interhelical region, at the interface of the beta(1)-alpha(1) loop, in helices alpha(1) and alpha(3), and in the beta(2)-alpha(2) loop region. The detailed analysis of interactions among secondary structure elements suggests a higher degree of structural ordering of HuPrP(V210I) under neutral-pH conditions, thus implying that spontaneous misfolding of PrPC may occur under acidic-pH conditions in endosomal compartments.

It has been shown that both immigration and local dispersal limitation can affect the community composition in both neutral and niche model. Hence, we use a spatially explicit individual-based model to investigate the potential influence of immigration rate and strength of local dispersal limitation on repeatability in both neutral and niche models. Similarity measures are used to quantify repeatability. We examine the repeatability of community composition among replicate communities (which means the same community repeats many times), and between niche and neutral replicate communities. We find the correlation between repeatability and immigration rate is positive in the neutral model and an inverted unimodal in the niche model. The correlation between repeatability and local dispersal distance is positive in the niche model and negative in the neutral model. High repeatability between niche communities and neutral communities is observed with high immigration rates or when high local dispersal distance appears in the niche model or low local dispersal distance in the neutral model. Our results show that repeatability of community composition is not only dependent on the types of community models (niche vs. neutrality) but also strongly determined by immigration rates and local dispersal limitation.

While the resorptive aspect of the disease has been studied intensely, less is known about the anabolic part of the syndrome or presumptive deficiencies in bone regeneration. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are the primary source of osteogenic regeneration. In the present study we aimed to unravel whether MSC biology is directly involved in the pathophysiology of the disease and therefore performed microarray analyses of hMSC of elderly patients (79-94 years old) suffering from osteoporosis (hMSC-OP). In comparison to age-matched controls we detected profound changes in the transcriptome in hMSC-OP, e.g. enhanced mRNA expression of known osteoporosis-associated genes (LRP5, RUNX2, COL1A1) and of genes involved in osteoclastogenesis (CSF1, PTH1R), but most notably of genes coding for inhibitors of WNT and BMP signaling, such as Sclerostin and MAB21L2. These candidate genes indicate intrinsic deficiencies in self-renewal and differentiation potential in osteoporotic stem cells. We also compared both hMSC-OP and non-osteoporotic hMSC-old of elderly donors to hMSC of similar to 30 years younger donors and found that the transcriptional changes acquired between the sixth and the ninth decade of life differed widely between osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic stem cells. In addition, we compared the osteoporotic transcriptome to long term-cultivated, senescent hMSC and detected some signs for pre-senescence in hMSC-OP. Our results suggest that in primary osteoporosis the transcriptomes of hMSC populations show distinct signatures and little overlap with non-osteoporotic aging, although we detected some hints for senescence-associated changes. While there are remarkable inter-individual variations as expected for polygenetic diseases, we could identify many susceptibility genes for osteoporosis known from genetic studies. We also found new candidates, e.g. MAB21L2, a novel repressor of BMP-induced transcription. Such transcriptional changes may reflect epigenetic changes, which are part of a specific osteoporosis-associated aging process.

We have utilised the MRC-Wellcome Trust Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR), to perform in-situ hybridisation studies on embryonic tissues, revealing an early onset neuronal, retinal and renal expression pattern for AHI1. An almost identical pattern of expression is seen with CEP290 in human embryonic and fetal tissue. A novel finding is that both AHI1 and CEP290 demonstrate strong expression within the developing choroid plexus, a ciliated structure important for central nervous system development. To test if AHI1 and CEP290 may have co-evolved, we carried out a genomic survey of a large group of organisms across eukaryotic evolution. We found that, in animals, ahi1 and cep290 are almost always found together; however in other organisms either one may be found independent of the other. Finally, we tested in murine epithelial cells if Ahi1 was required for recruitment of Cep290 to the centrosome. We found no obvious differences in Cep290 localisation in the presence or absence of Ahi1, suggesting that, while Ahi1 and Cep290 may function together in the whole organism, they are not interdependent for localisation within a single cell. Taken together these data support a role for AHI1 and CEP290 in multiple organs throughout development and we suggest that this accounts for the wide phenotypic spectrum of AHI1 and CEP290 mutations in man.

They are potential regulators of normal mammary gland development and of the maintenance of mammary epithelial progenitor cells. This study was undertaken to determine the role of miR-30b on the establishment of a functional mouse mammary gland. miR-30b is a member of the miR-30 family, composed of 6 miRNA that are highly conserved in vertebrates. It has been suggested to play a role in the differentiation of several cell types.Methodology/Principal Findings: The expression of miR-30b was found to be regulated during mammary gland development. Transgenic mice overexpressing miR-30b in mammary epithelial cells were used to investigate its role. During lactation, mammary histological analysis of the transgenic mice showed a reduction in the size of alveolar lumen, a defect of the lipid droplets and a growth defect of pups fed by transgenic females. Moreover some mammary epithelial differentiated structures persisted during involution, suggesting a delay in the process. The genes whose expression was affected by the overexpression of miR-30b were characterized by microarray analysis.Conclusion/ Significance: Our data suggests that miR-30b is important for the biology of the mammary gland and demonstrates that the deregulation of only one miRNA could affect lactation and involution.

Despite being a monovular species, 2-12 corpora lutea (CLs) were found on the elephant ovaries during their long pregnancy lasting on average 640 days. However, the function and the formation of the additional CLs and their meaning remain unexplained. Here, we show from the example of the elephant, the close relationship between the maternally determined luteal phase length, the formation of multiple luteal structures and their progestagen secretion, the timespan of early embryonic development until implantation and maternal recognition. Through three-dimensional and Colour Flow ultrasonography of the ovaries and the uterus, we conclude that pregnant elephants maintain active CL throughout gestation that appear as main source of progestagens. Two LH peaks during the follicular phase ensure the development of a set of 5.4 +/- 2.7 CLs. Accessory CLs (acCLs) form prior to ovulation after the first luteinizing hormone (LH) peak, while the ovulatory CL (ovCL) forms after the second LH peak. After five to six weeks (the normal luteal phase lifespan), all existing CLs begin to regress. However, they resume growing as soon as an embryo becomes ultrasonographically apparent on day 49 +/- 2. After this time, all pregnancy CLs grow significantly larger than in a non-conceptive luteal phase and are maintained until after parturition. The long luteal phase is congruent with a slow early embryonic development and luteal rescue only starts 'last minute', with presumed implantation of the embryo. Our findings demonstrate a highly successful reproductive solution, different from currently described mammalian models.

As long as both genes are expressed, cells carrying the complex can remain healthy. However, loss of the complex (including segregational loss in daughter cells) can entail death of the cell. We develop a theoretical model to explore a number of evolutionary puzzles posed by toxin-antitoxin (TA) population biology. We first extend earlier results demonstrating that TA complexes can spread on plasmids, as an adaptation to plasmid competition in spatially structured environments, and highlight the role of kin selection. We then considered the emergence of TA complexes on plasmids from previously unlinked toxin and antitoxin genes. We find that one of these traits must offer at least initially a direct advantage in some but not all environments encountered by the evolving plasmid population. Finally, our study predicts non-transitive 'rock-paper-scissors' dynamics to be a feature of intragenomic conflict mediated by TA complexes.

Mosquitoes transmit the agents that cause these diseases. Published information on mosquitoes in the Seychelles is notably dispersed in the literature. The maximum number of species obtained on a single field survey does not exceed 14 species.Methods: We performed a comprehensive bibliographic review using mosquito and Seychelles as the key words, as well as conducted a mosquito field survey for larval and adult stages during the rainy season in December 2008. Sixteen sites were sampled on four granitic islands (Mahe, Praslin, La Digue and Aride) and six sites on coralline atolls in the extreme southwest of the country (Aldabra group).Results: We found published references to 21 mosquito species identified at least on one occasion in the Seychelles. Our collections comprised 18 species of mosquitoes, all of them from the subfamily Culicinae; no Anophelinae was found. We also confirm that Aedes seychellensis is a junior synonym of Ae. (Aedimorphus) albocephalus. The first records for Culex antennatus and Cx. sunyaniensis are presented from the country, specifically from Aldabra and Praslin, respectively. Based on a comparison of the taxa occurring on the granitic versus coralline islands, only three species, Ae. albocephalus, Cx. scottii and Cx. simpsoni are shared. Aedes albopictus appeared to exclude largely Ae. aegypti on the granitic islands; however, Ae. aegypti was common on Aldabra, where Ae. albopictus has not been recorded. The notable aggressiveness of mosquitoes towards humans on coralline islands was mainly due to two species, the females of which are difficult to distinguish: Ae. fryeri and Ae. (Aedimorphus) sp. A. The number of mosquito species collected at least once in the Seychelles is now 22, among which five species (Ae. (Adm) sp. A, Cx. stellatus, Uranotaenia browni. Ur. nepenthes and Ur. pandani) and one subspecies (Ae. vigilax vansomerenae) are considered as endemic. Two illustrated identification keys, one for adult females and the other for larval stages, are presented.Conclusions: The knowledge of the culicidian fauna in the Seychelles has been notably updated. The number of mosquito species is relatively large with regards to land surface and distances to continental Africa, although the anophelines are totally lacking. The complex natural history of mosquitoes in the Seychelles provides examples of both vicariance- and dispersal-mediated divergences. They present superb examples for theoretical and applied island biology.

However, there are contradicting reports on whether STAT is involved in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. To better define the role of STAT in TCR signaling, we activated the CD4/CD8-associated Lck kinase by co-crosslinking TCR and CD4/CD8 co-receptors in human peripheral blood T cells. Sequential STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 activation was observed 1 h after TCR stimulation suggesting that STAT proteins are not the immediate targets in the TCR complex. We further identified interferon-gamma as the key cytokine in STAT1 activation upon TCR engagement. In contrast to transient STAT activation in cytokine response, this autocrine/paracrine-induced STAT activation was sustained. It correlated with the absence of two suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, SOCS3 and cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein that are negative feedback regulators of STAT signaling. Moreover, enforced expression of SOCS3 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of zeta-associated protein kinase of 70 kD in TCR-stimulated human Jurkat T cells. This is the first report demonstrating delayed and prolonged STAT activation coordinated with the loss of SOCS expression in human primary T cells after co-crosslinking of TCR and CD4/CD8 co-receptors.

Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for hypoxic tumor selection is essential to gain further insight into tumor biology. Our aim in this study was to investigate whether hypoxia-responsive GLTSCR2 contributes to death resistance and increased invasiveness of hypoxia-selected glioblastoma cells. We found that repeated hypoxia downregulates p53-upstream regulator, GLTSCR2, which resulted in increased death resistance and invasive potential of glioblastoma cells. Restoration of GLTSCR2 expression suppressed the malignant potential of hypoxia-selected cells. Our results indicate that curscR2 participates in hypoxia-induced malignant potential.

Fifteen hair sheep (16 +/- 4.2 kg live weight (LW)) raised free of gastrointestinal nematodes were used. Sheep were fed a basal diet: grain based concentrate and Pennisetum purpureum grass (900 and 100 g/kg DM, respectively) and were infected on day 0 with 3000 H. contortus infective larvae. On day 28 post-infection (PI) sheep were distributed to three groups being: Control (100 g/kg DM of basal diet), HA group (basal diet 600 + H. albicans 400) and the HA + PEG group (basal diet 600 + H. albicans 400)+ Polyethylene glycol (PEG). The H. albicans foliage was supplied for 13 d including 7 d of adaptation (i.e., day 28-40 PI). The content of condensed tannins (CT), total polyphenols (TP) and total tannins (TT) was determined in the foliage. Concentrate, grass and H. albicans intake (g DM/kg LW0.75), DMD and H. contortus egg excretions were determined. Sheep were slaughtered at day 41 PI to assess adult worm burdens, female worm lengths and fecundity (i.e., eggs in utero). Foliage had (g/kg DM): 71.5 CT, 61.3 TP and 66.9 TT. Experimental groups had similar feed intakes, and intake of H. albi cans was not affected by PEG. The DMD of HA + PEG and HA groups was lower than Control (P<0.05). Post-mortem worm burdens were similar in all groups, but the H. contortus females in the HA group were shorter and had reduced fecundity (P<0.05). Adding PEG (HA + PEG) eliminated the effect of H. albicans intake on worm length. A short period of H. albicans intake affected the DMD of sheep and reduced the H. contortus female worm length and fecundity. The use of this type of tannin-rich foliage could bring nutritional and anti-parasitic benefits to the ruminants which consume them. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our studies demonstrate that interleukin-27 (IL-27) also promoted expression of T-bet and CXCR3 in Treg cells. During infection with Toxoplasma gondii, a similar population emerged that limited T cell responses and was dependent on IFN-gamma in the periphery but on IL-27 at mucosa! sites. Transfer of Treg cells ameliorated the infection-induced pathology observed in Il27(-/-) mice, and this was dependent on their ability to produce IL-10. Microarray analysis revealed that Treg cells exposed to either IFN-gamma or IL-27 have distinct transcriptional profiles. Thus, IFN-gamma and IL-27 have different roles in Treg cell biology and IL-27 is a key cytokine that promotes the development of Treg cells specialized to control Th1 cell-mediated immunity at local sites of inflammation.

However, its pathological role in glioma is unknown. Using an immunohistochemical staining assay, we demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between expression of Migfilin and pathological tumor grade in 217 clinical glioma samples. High Migfilin expression is associated with poor prognosis for patients with glioma. Investigation of the molecular mechanism shows that Migfilin promotes migration and invasion in glioma cells. Moreover, Migfilin positively modulates the expression and activity of epidermal growth factor receptor, and Migfilin-mediated migration and invasion depend on epidermal growth factor receptor-induced PLC-gamma and STAT3-signaling pathways. Our results may provide significant clinical application, including use of Migfilin as a molecular marker in glioma for early diagnosis and as an indicator of prognosis.

In eukaryotes, it is catalyzed by a multisubunit membrane-associated enzyme, oligosaccharyltransferase (OT). We report the high resolution structure of the C-terminal domain of eukaryotic Stt3p. Unlike its soluble beta-sheet-rich prokaryotic counterparts, our model reveals that the C-terminal domain of yeast Stt3p is highly helical and has an overall oblate spheroid-shaped structure containing a membrane-embedded region. Anchoring of this protein segment to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is likely to bring the membrane-embedded donor substrate closer, thus facilitating glycosylation efficiency. Structural comparison of the region near the WWDYG signature motif revealed that the acceptor substrate-binding site of yeast OT strikingly resembles its prokaryotic counterparts, suggesting a conserved mechanism of N-glycosylation from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Furthermore, comparison of the NMR and cryo-EM structures of yeast OT revealed that the molecular architecture of this acceptor substrate-recognizing domain has interesting spatial specificity for interactions with other essential OT subunits.

Although, microarray-based transcriptional profiling has established transcriptional reprogramming as an important mechanism for signal integration and cell function of macrophages, current knowledge on transcriptional regulation of human macrophages is far from complete. To discover novel marker genes, an area of great need particularly in human macrophage biology but also to generate a much more thorough transcriptome of human M1- and M1-like macrophages, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of human macrophages. Using this approach we can now provide a high-resolution transcriptome profile of human macrophages under classical (M1-like) and alternative (M2-like) polarization conditions and demonstrate a dynamic range exceeding observations obtained by previous technologies, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the transcriptome of human macrophages. Using this approach, we identify important gene clusters so far not appreciated by standard microarray techniques. In addition, we were able to detect differential promoter usage, alternative transcription start sites, and different coding sequences for 57 gene loci in human macrophages. Moreover, this approach led to the identification of novel M1-associated (CD120b, TLR2, SLAMF7) as well as M2-associated (CD1a, CD1b, CD93, CD226) cell surface markers. Taken together, these data support that high-resolution transcriptome profiling of human macrophages by RNA-seq leads to a better understanding of macrophage function and will form the basis for a better characterization of macrophages in human health and disease.

While network analysis has been successfully applied to high-throughput biological systems, less has been done regarding their application in more applied fields of medicine; here we show an application based on standard medical diagnostic data. We apply network analysis to Class III malocclusion, one of the most difficult to understand and treat orofacial anomaly. We hypothesize that different interactions of the skeletal components can contribute to pathological disequilibrium; in order to test this hypothesis, we apply network analysis to 532 Class III young female patients. The topology of the Class III malocclusion obtained by network analysis shows a strong co-occurrence of abnormal skeletal features. The pattern of these occurrences influences the vertical and horizontal balance of disharmony in skeletal form and position. Patients with more unbalanced orthodontic phenotypes show preponderance of the pathological skeletal nodes and minor relevance of adaptive dentoalveolar equilibrating nodes. Furthermore, by applying Power Graphs analysis we identify some functional modules among orthodontic nodes. These modules correspond to groups of tightly inter-related features and presumably constitute the key regulators of plasticity and the sites of unbalance of the growing dentofacial Class III system. The data of the present study show that, in their most basic abstraction level, the orofacial characteristics can be represented as graphs using nodes to represent orthodontic characteristics, and edges to represent their various types of interactions. The applications of this mathematical model could improve the interpretation of the quantitative, patient-specific information, and help to better targeting therapy. Last but not least, the methodology we have applied in analyzing orthodontic features can be applied easily to other fields of the medical science.

The DREAM project offers some types of experimental data, such as knockout data, knockdown data, time series data, etc. Among them, multifactorial perturbation data are easier and less expensive to obtain than other types of experimental data and are thus more common in practice. In this article, a new algorithm is presented for the inference of GRNs using the DREAM4 multifactorial perturbation data. The GRN inference problem among p genes is decomposed into p x (p-1) different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression level of a target gene is predicted solely from the expression level of a potential regulation gene. For different potential regulation genes, different weights for a specific target gene are constructed by using the sum of squared residuals and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Then these weights are normalized to reflect effort differences of regulating distinct genes. By appropriately choosing the parameters of the power law, we constructe a 0-1 integer programming problem. By solving this problem, direct regulation genes for an arbitrary gene can be estimated. And, the normalized weight of a gene is modified, on the basis of the estimation results about the existence of direct regulations to it. These normalized and modified weights are used in queuing the possibility of the existence of a corresponding direct regulation. Computation results with the DREAM4 In Silico Size 100 Multifactorial subchallenge show that estimation performances of the suggested algorithm can even outperform the best team. Using the real data provided by the DREAM5 Network Inference Challenge, estimation performances can be ranked third. Furthermore, the high precision of the obtained most reliable predictions shows the suggested algorithm may be helpful in guiding biological experiment designs.

Here we introduce a novel algorithm named SCoR (Survival analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression and Random resampling) to apply random resampling and clustering methods in identifying gene features correlated with time to event data. This is shown to reduce overfitting noises involved in microarray data analysis and discover functional gene sets linked to patient survival. SCoR independently identified a common poor prognostic signature composed of cell proliferation genes from six out of eight breast cancer datasets. Furthermore, a sequential SCoR analysis on highly proliferative breast cancers repeatedly identified T/B cell markers as favorable prognosis factors. In glioblastoma, SCoR identified a common good prognostic signature of chromosome 10 genes from two gene expression datasets (TCGA and REMBRANDT), recapitulating the fact that loss of one copy of chromosome 10 (which harbors the tumor suppressor PTEN) is linked to poor survival in glioblastoma patients. SCoR also identified prognostic genes on sex chromosomes in lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting patient gender might be used to predict outcome in this disease. These results demonstrate the power of SCoR to identify common and biologically meaningful prognostic gene expression signatures.

Evolutionary conserved roles of this mechanism include control over fundamental processes such as cell growth or apoptosis. Deregulation of the JAM-STAT signaling is frequently associated with cancerogenesis. JAK-STAT pathways become hyper-activated in many human tumors. Therefore, components of these pathways are an attractive target for drugs, which design requires as adequate models as possible. Although, in principle, JAK-STAT signaling is relatively simple, the ambiguities in a receptor activation prevent a clear explanation of the underlying molecular mechanism.Here, we compare four variants of a computational model of the JAK1/2-STAT1 signaling pathway. These variants capture known, basic discrepancies in the mechanism of activation of a cytokine receptor, in the context of all key components of the pathway. We carry out a comparative analysis using mass action kinetics. The investigated differences are so marginal that all models satisfy a goodness of fit criteria to the extent that the state of the art Bayesian model selection (BMS) method fails to significantly promote one model. Therefore, we comparatively investigate changes in a robustness of the JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway variants using the global sensitivity analysis method (GSA), complemented with the identifiability analysis (IA). Both BMS and GSA are used to analyze the models for the varying parameter values. We found out that, both BMS and GSA, narrowed down to the receptor activation component, slightly promote the least complex model. Further, insightful, comprehensive GSA, motivated by the concept of robustness, allowed us to show that the precise order of reactions of a ligand binding and a receptor dimerization is not as important as the on-membrane pre-assembly of the dimers in the absence of ligand.The main value of this work is an evaluation of the usefulness of different model selection methods in a frequently encountered, but not much discussed case of a model of a considerable size, which has several variants differing at peripheries. In such situation, all considered variants can reach nearly perfect agreement with respect to their numerical simulations results and, most often, the sufficient experimental data to test against is not available. We argue that in such an adverse setting, the GSA and IA, although not directly corresponding to the model selection problem, can be more informative than the representative, generalizability-based approaches to this task. An additional insight into how the responsibility for the network dynamics spreads among model parameters, enables more conscious, expert-mediated choice of the preferred model.

EPR can also probe the interplay of light and electricity in organic solar cells(5-7) and light-emitting diodes(8), and the origin of decoherence in condensed matter, which is of fundamental importance to the development of quantum information processors(9-13). Like nuclear magnetic resonance, EPR spectroscopy becomes more powerful at high magnetic fields and frequencies, and with excitation by coherent pulses rather than continuous waves. However, the difficulty of generating sequences of powerful pulses at frequencies above 100 gigahertz has, until now, confined high-power pulsed EPR to magnetic fields of 3.5 teslas and below. Here we demonstrate that one-kilowatt pulses from a free-electron laser can power a pulsed EPR spectrometer at 240 gigahertz (8.5 teslas), providing transformative enhancements over the alternative, a state-of-the-art similar to 30-milliwatt solid-state source. Our spectrometer can rotate spin-1/2 electrons through pi/2 in only 6 nanoseconds (compared to 300 nanoseconds with the solid-state source).

Zonulin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were measured from feces to estimate gut leakage at baseline and at the end of treatment. Venous blood was collected at baseline and after 14 weeks, before and immediately post exercise, to determine carbonyl proteins (CP), malondialdehyde (MDA), total oxidation status of lipids (TOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Statistical analysis used multifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). Level of significance was set at p < 0.05, a trend at p < 0.1.Results: Zonulin decreased with supplementation from values slightly above normal into normal ranges (<30 ng/ml) and was significantly lower after 14 weeks with probiotics compared to placebo (p = 0.019). We observed no influence on a1-antitrypsin (p > 0.1). CP increased significantly from pre to post exercise in both groups at baseline and in the placebo group after 14 weeks of treatment (p = 0.006). After 14 weeks, CP concentrations were tendentially lower with probiotics (p = 0.061). TOS was slightly increased above normal in both groups, at baseline and after 14 weeks of treatment. There was no effect of supplementation or exercise on TOS. At baseline, both groups showed considerably higher TNF-alpha concentrations than normal. After 14 weeks TNF-alpha was tendentially lower in the supplemented group (p = 0.054). IL-6 increased significantly from pre to post exercise in both groups (p = 0.001), but supplementation had no effect.

Hybridization with the closely related Fringed Darter (E. crossopterum) has been assumed as a risk to E. forbesi. To assess chronology and similarity of nesting habitat between these species, nests of both egg-clustering darters were observed through the spring nesting seasons in four streams during 2008 and 2009. Microhabitat variables associated with nests exhibited evidence of headwater specialization by E. forbesi that may isolate spawning populations from E. crossopterum. Etheostoma forbesi used nest rocks of smaller average dimensions and bottom surface area, and nested at shallower depths where water velocities were higher than nesting individuals of E. crossopterum. Nesting chronology and clutch sizes were similar between species, with spawning periods similar to those reported for other darter species in subgenus Catonotus and with clutch sizes up to 2,000 eggs/nest. Nests were present from March through early June at Duke, Lewis, and Meadow Branch creeks, but spawning was delayed by approximately two weeks at West Fork Hickory Creek, the largest and only spring-fed stream in the study. Etheostoma forbesi displayed peak egg production from mid-April to early May in Duke and Lewis creeks. Etheostoma crossopterum in a similar-sized stream also followed this chronological pattern, but spawning of E. crossopterum was delayed and the active nesting period was protracted into mid-June in the largest and spring-fed stream. Under contempory streamflow conditions, the observed differences in spawning microhabitat suggest a low likelihood of interspecific hybridization, despite the similarities in timing of the two species' spawning activities.

Crawfish Frogs (Lithobates areolatus) are a relatively understudied species of North American amphibian considered to be ""Near Threatened"" globally. To better understand the biology of this species, and in particular to assess the role that movements play in affecting survivorship, we radio tracked 48 Crawfish Frog adults in 2009-2010. Our study encompassed a total of 7,898 teiemetered-frog days; individual frogs were tracked for up to 606 days. These data demonstrate two behaviors previously undocumented in this species: 1) migration distances that averaged nearly 0.5 km, and for one frog was approximately 1.2 km; and 2) philopatry to upland burrows excavated by crayfish. Together, these findings indicate that Crawfish Frogs have a remarkable ability to home to distant upland burrow sites. Burrow fidelity in Crawfish Frogs involves, in part, following similar migration routes to and from breeding wetlands. Burrow fidelity also occurs after ranging movements, and again often involves individual frogs following the same circuit across years. We demonstrate that movements are hazardous for Crawfish Frogs (about 12 times riskier than burrow dwelling), and therefore have survival consequences. Our data further suggest that adult Crawfish Frogs are not typically moving long distances from one upland burrow to another to populate new sites; instead two mechanisms adults varying breeding wetlands across years and juvenile dispersion are primarily responsible for the colonization of new habitats.

In contrast, there was not chemosensory recognition between the two subspecies of B. constrictor. We show that some Neotropical snake species are able to use chemical cues of conspecifics in intraspecific recognition, but further studies are needed to analyze the role of chemical signals in their biology and social behavior.

Differences in the colonization abilities of species with different ploidy levels are well known: tetraploids, in contrast to diploids, are able to undergo intra-gametophytic selfing. Because fertilization is a post-dispersal process in ferns, selfing results in better colonization abilities in tetraploids because of single spore colonization. Considerably less is known about the gene flow among populations of different ploidy levels. The present study examines two rare fern species that differ in ploidy. While it has already been confirmed that tetraploid species are better at colonizing, the present study focuses on the gene flow among existing populations. We analyzed the genetic structure of a set of populations in a 10x10 km study region using isoenzymes. Genetic variation in tetraploid species is distributed mainly among populations; the genetic distance between populations is correlated with the geographical distance, and larger populations host more genetic diversity than smaller populations. In the diploid species, most variability is partitioned within populations; the genetic distance is not related to geographic distance, and the genetic diversity of populations is not related to the population size. This suggests that in tetraploid species, which undergo selfing, gene flow is limited. In contrast, in the diploid species, which experience outcrossing, gene flow is extensive and the whole system behaves as one large population. Our results suggest that in ferns, the ability to colonize new habitats and the gene flow among existing populations are affected by the mating system.

They provide quantitative information about blood flow, which benefits applications ranging from developmental biology to tumor perfusion studies. Studies using these methods can be classified based on whether they use artificial tracers or red blood cells to visualize the fluid motion. We here present the first direct comparison in vivo of both methods. For high magnification cases, the experiments using red blood cells strongly underestimate the flow (up to 50% in the present case), as compared to the tracer results. For medium magnification cases, the results from both methods are indistinguishable as they give the same underestimation of the real velocities (approximately 33%, based on in vitro reference measurements). These results suggest that flow characteristics reported in literature cannot be compared without a careful evaluation of the imaging characteristics. A method to predict the expected flow averaging behavior for a particular facility is presented.

Connectivity and non-linear regulatory effects, however, make it necessary to consider multiple objectives in order to identify useful strategies that balance out different metabolic issues. This is a fundamental aspect, as optimization of maximum yield in a given condition may involve unrealistic values in other key processes. Due to the difficulties associated with detailed non-linear models, analysis using stoichiometric descriptions and linear optimization methods have become rather popular in systems biology. However, despite being useful, these approaches fail in capturing the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the underlying metabolic systems and the regulatory signals involved. Targeting more complex biological systems requires the application of global optimization methods to non-linear representations. In this work we address the multi-objective global optimization of metabolic networks that are described by a special class of models based on the power-law formalism: the generalized mass action (GMA) representation. Our goal is to develop global optimization methods capable of efficiently dealing with several biological criteria simultaneously. In order to overcome the numerical difficulties of dealing with multiple criteria in the optimization, we propose a heuristic approach based on the epsilon constraint method that reduces the computational burden of generating a set of Pareto optimal alternatives, each achieving a unique combination of objectives values. To facilitate the post-optimal analysis of these solutions and narrow down their number prior to being tested in the laboratory, we explore the use of Pareto filters that identify the preferred subset of enzymatic profiles. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by means of a case study that optimizes the ethanol production in the fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The number of genes regulated in vitro and in vivo were much more than the randomly sampled number, but no significant correlation was observed between the in vitro and in vivo experiments. We performed a pathway analysis and GO grouping to expand the approach. In the pathway analysis, we narrowed down the hepatotoxic pathways to focus on toxicity. Then, the percentages of overlapping pathways increased. We found pathways associated with liver function in all experiments, such as the adipocyte signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. In the GO grouping analysis, the clusters obtained were primarily related to lipid metabolic and synthetic processes. The percentage of common GO terms between in vitro and in vivo experiments also increased.

This approach allows the derivation of self-consistent (Euler-Lagrange) equations to describe the flow of spheres through channels. The partial differential equations derived involve the global interactions of the spheres and are replaced here with a local approximation that we call steric PNP (Poisson-Nernst-Planck) (Lin, T. C.; Eisenberg, B. To be submitted for publication, 2012). Kong combining rules are used and a range of values of steric interaction parameters are studied. These parameters change the energetics of steric interaction but have no effect on diffusion coefficients in models and simulations. Calculations are made for the calcium (EEEE, EEEA) and sodium channels (DEKA) previously studied in Monte Carlo simulations with comparable results. The biological function is quite sensitive to the steric interaction parameters, and we speculate that a wide range of the function of channels and transporters, even enzymes, might depend on such terms. We point out that classical theories of channels, transporters, and enzymes depend on ideal representations of ionic solutions in which nothing interacts with nothing, even in the enormous concentrations found near and in these proteins or near electrodes in electrochemical cells for that matter. We suggest that a theory designed to handle interactions might be more appropriate. We show that one such theory is feasible and computable: steric PNP allows a direct comparison with experiments measuring flows as well as equilibrium properties. Steric PNP combines atomic and macroscales in a computable formulation that allows the calculation of the macroscopic effects of changes in atomic scale structures (size congruent to 10(-10) meters) studied very extensively in channology and molecular biology.

Polarized dark-field scattering microscopy correlated with scanning electron microscopy of low and high aspect ratio gold nanorods demonstrated accuracies of 2.3 degrees, which is a 5-fold improvement over photothermal and defocused imaging methods. By assigning the three color channels of the imaging detector (red, green, and blue) to the plasmon resonance wavelengths of the nanostructure, the quantitative display of orientation improved by 200%. The reduced symmetry of a gold nanorod Dolmen structure further improved the sensitivity of colorimetric orientation by a factor of 2 due to the comparative intensities of the resonances.

A rapidly elongating root or hypocotyl of twisting mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a helical growth with a handedness opposite to that of the underlying cortical microtubule arrays in epidermal cells. However, how such a hierarchical helical order emerges is currently unknown. We propose a model for investigating macroscopic chiral asymmetry in Arabidopsis mutants. Our elastic model suggests that the helical pattern observed is a direct consequence of the simultaneous presence of anisotropic growth and tilting of cortical microtubule arrays. We predict that the root helical pitch angle is a function of the microtubule helical angle and elastic moduli of the tissues. The proposed model is versatile and is potentially important for other biological systems ranging from protein fibrous structures to tree trunks.

In many animals, supply and demand increase together as the body grows, thus making it impossible to tease apart the relative contributions of changing supply and demand to the observed scaling of metabolic rate. In larval insects, the large components of the tracheal system are set in size at each molt, but then remain constant in size until the next molt. Larvae of Manduca sexta increase up to ten-fold in mass between molts, leading to increased oxygen need without a concomitant increase in supply. At the molt, the tracheal system is shed and replaced with a new, larger one. Due to this discontinuous growth of the tracheal system, insect larvae present an ideal system in which to examine the relative contributions of supply and demand of oxygen to the ontogenetic scaling of metabolic rate. We observed that the metabolic rate at the beginning of successive instars scales hypoallometrically. This decrease in specific intrinsic demand could be due to a decrease in the proportion of highly metabolically active tissues (the midgut) or to a decrease in mitochondrial activity in individual cells. We found that decreased intrinsic demand, mediated by a decrease in the proportion of highly metabolically active tissues in the fifth instar, along with a decrease in the specific mitochondrial activity, contribute to the hypoallometric scaling of metabolic rate.

These gaps in knowledge concern the distribution of durations of malaria infections, determination of peak parasitemia during acute infection, the relationships among gametocytes and immune responses and infectiousness to mosquitoes, and the effect of antigenic structure on reinfection outcomes. The present model of intrahost dynamics of P. falciparum implements detailed representations of parasite and immune dynamics, with structures based on minimal extrapolations from first-principles biology in its foundations. The model is designed to quickly and readily accommodate gains in mechanistic understanding and to evaluate effects of alternative biological hypothesis through in silico experiments. Simulations follow the parasite from the liver-stage through the detailed asexual cycle to clearance while tracking gametocyte populations. The modeled immune system includes innate inflammatory and specific antibody responses to a repertoire of antigens. The mechanistic focus provides clear explanations for the structure of the distribution of infection durations through the interaction of antigenic variation and innate and adaptive immunity. Infectiousness to mosquitoes appears to be determined not only by the density of gametocytes but also by the level of inflammatory cytokines, which harmonizes an extensive series of study results. Finally, pre-existing immunity can either decrease or increase the duration of infections upon reinfection, depending on the degree of overlap in antigenic repertoires and the strength of the pre-existing immunity.

The fight goes back and forth, giving the neighbours a hard time. These kind of reciprocal punishments are known as vendettas and they are a cross-cultural phenomenon. In evolutionary biology, punishment is seen as a mechanism for maintaining cooperative behaviour. However, this notion of punishment excludes vendettas. Vendettas pose a special kind of evolutionary problem: they incur high costs on individuals, i.e. costs of punishing and costs of being punished, without any benefits. Theoretically speaking, punishment should be rare in dyadic relationships and vendettas would not evolve under natural selection. In contrast, punishment is assumed to be more efficient in group environments which then can pave the way for vendettas. Accordingly, we found that under the experimental conditions of a prisoner's dilemma game, human participants punished only rarely and vendettas are scarce. In contrast, we found that participants retaliated frequently in the group environment of a public goods game. They even engaged in cost-intense vendettas (i.e. continuous retaliation), especially when the first punishment was unjustified or ambiguous. Here, punishment was mainly targeted at defectors in the beginning, but provocations led to mushrooming of counter-punishments. Despite the counter-punishing behaviour, participants were able to enhance cooperation levels in the public goods game. Few participants even seemed to anticipate the outbreak of costly vendettas and delayed their punishment to the last possible moment. Overall, our results highlight the importance of different social environments while studying punishment as a cooperation-enhancing mechanism.

The tendency for these surfaces to expel water from their vicinity leads to self-assembly of macromolecular complexes. In this article, we show with a realistic model for a biologically pertinent system how this phenomenon appears at the molecular level. We focus on the association of the C-terminal domain (CA-C) of the human immunodeficiency virus capsid protein. By combining all-atom simulations with specialized sampling techniques, we measure the water density distribution during the approach of two CA-C proteins as a function of separation and amino acid sequence in the interfacial region. The simulations demonstrate that CA-C protein-protein interactions sit at the edge of a dewetting transition and that this mesoscopic manifestation of the underlying liquid-vapor phase transition can be readily manipulated by biology or protein engineering to significantly affect association behavior. Although the wild-type protein remains wet until contact, we identify a set of in silico mutations, in which three hydrophilic amino acids are replaced with nonpolar residues, that leads to dewetting before association. The existence of dewetting depends on the size and relative locations of substituted residues separated by nanometer length scales, indicating long-range cooperativity and a sensitivity to surface topography. These observations identify important details that are missing from descriptions of protein association based on buried hydrophobic surface area.

The binding of inhibitors and activators to these sites enabled the rational modulation of the sensor's target affinity-and thus its useful dynamic range-over 3 orders of magnitude.

In such endeavors, DNA is the current building block of choice because of its predictable and programmable self-assembly. The use of peptide- and protein-based systems, however, has potential advantages due to their more-varied chemistries, structures and functions, and the prospects for recombinant production through gene synthesis and expression. Here, we present the design and characterization of two complementary peptides programmed to form a parallel heterodimeric coiled coil, which we use as the building blocks for larger, supramolecular assemblies. To achieve the latter, the two peptides are joined via peptidic linkers of variable lengths to produce a range of assemblies, from flexible fibers of indefinite length, through large colloidal-scale assemblies, down to closed and discrete nanoscale objects of defined stoichiometry. We posit that the different modes of assembly reflect the interplay between steric constraints imposed by short linkers and the bulk of the helices, and entropic factors that favor the formation of many smaller objects as the linker length is increased.

We demonstrated a shotgun proteomic method to monitor the temporal yeast proteome in early, middle and late exponential phases. Our study identified a total of 1389 proteins combining all 2D-LC-MS/MS runs. The temporal Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome was enriched with proteolysis, radical detoxification, translation, one-carbon metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle. Heat shock proteins and proteins associated with oxidative stress response were found throughout the exponential phase. The most abundant proteins observed were translation elongation factors, ribosomal proteins, chaperones and glycolytic enzymes. The high abundance of the H-protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex (Gcv3p) indicated the availability of glycine in the environment. We observed differentially expressed proteins and the induced proteins at mid-exponential phase were involved in ribosome biogenesis, mitochondria DNA binding/replication and transcriptional activator. Induction of tryptophan synthase (Trp5p) indicated the abundance of tryptophan during the fermentation. As fermentation progressed toward late exponential phase, a decrease in cell proliferation was implied from the repression of ribosomal proteins, transcription coactivators, methionine aminopeptidase and translation-associated proteins.

In this Article, we show that data-mining of these published libraries while applying strict empirical thresholds yields many characteristics of protein biology. In particular, we demonstrate that the size and increasingly comprehensive nature of these libraries, generated from whole-proteome digests, enables inference from the presence but crucially also from the absence of spectra for individual peptides. We illustrate implicit biological trends that lead to significant absence of spectra accounted for by complex post-translational modifications and overlooked proteolytic sites.

By selective labeling of a guanine (G)-quadruplex motif with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), here, it is established that a large reduction in FA response can be specifically associated with the unfolding -> folding transition of G-quadruplex structures. On the basis of fluorescence intensity, polarization and lifetime analysis, and molecular docking simulation, the mechanism was found to be that the labeled fluorophore (TMR) can intramolecularly interact with adjacent G bases in an unfolded G-quadruplex motif, which allows for the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) occurring between the fluorophore and G bases, leading to a short fluorescence lifetime. Upon the folding of the motif to form a stable G-quadruplex structure, the intramolecular interactions and the concomitant PET could be eliminated with an increased fluorescence lifetime, leading to a large reduction in the FA response. On the basis of this mechanism, a novel, specific, and sensitive FA approach was developed for the detection of biologically and functionally important G-quadruplex structures. The approach is examined and validated using one normal G-quadruplex motif, five mutants, and six small cations and is potentially applicable to the study of G-quadruplexes at single molecule level, ligand screening, profiling of highly ordered DNA nanostructures, and biosensing.

However, quantitative viral load data from other simultaneously collected sample types are missing. As a consequence, primary replication in the GI system cannot be differentiated from swallowed virus from the respiratory tract.Here we present a retrospective quantitative longitudinal analysis in simultaneously harvested specimens from different organ sites of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This allows the definition of sample types where deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection can be expected and, as a consequence, the identification of their primary replication site.Findings: Viral DNA loads from 37 patients undergoing HSCT were quantified in respiratory tract secretions (RTS), stool and urine samples as well as in leukocytes (n = 449). Leukocyte-associated virus could not be found. WUPyV was found in feces, RTS and urine samples of an infant, while KIPyV was repeatedly detected in RTS and stool samples of 4 adult patients.RTS and stool samples were matched to determine the viral load difference showing a mean difference of 2.3 log copies/ml (p < 0.001).Conclusions: The data collected in this study suggest that virus detection in the GI tract results from swallowed virus from the respiratory tract (RT).

Synthetic macromolecules have changed the world and currently play a major role in all aspects of daily life. Due to their tailorable properties, these materials have fueled the invention of new techniques and goods, from the yogurt cup to the car seat belts. To fulfill the requirements of modem life, polymers and their composites have become increasingly complex. One strategy for altering polymer properties is to combine different polymer segments within one polymer, known as block copolymers. The microphase separation of the individual polymer components and the resulting formation of well defined nanosized domains provide a broad range of new materials with various properties. Block copolymers facilitated the development of innovative concepts in the fields of drug delivery, nanomedicine, organic electronics, and nanoscience.Block copolymers consist exclusively of organic polymers, but researchers are increasingly interested in materials that combine synthetic materials and biomacromolecules. Although many researchers have explored the combination of proteins with organic polymers, far fewer investigations have explored nucleic acid/polymer hybrids, known as DNA block copolymers (DBCs). DNA as a polymer block provides several advantages over other biopolymers. The availability of automated synthesis offers DNA segments with nucleotide precision, which facilitates the fabrication of hybrid materials with monodisperse biopolymer blocks. The directed functionalization of modified single-stranded DNA by Watson Crick base-pairing is another key feature of DNA block copolymers. Furthermore, the appropriate selection of DNA sequence and organic polymer gives control over the material properties and their self-assembly into supramolecular structures.

Molecular biology-based approaches, such as GFP-fusion tags and monoclonal antibodies, have served as important tools for the visualization of individual proteins in cells. Although these techniques continue to be valuable for live cell imaging, they have a number of limitations that have only been addressed by recent progress in chemistry-based approaches. These chemical approaches benefit greatly from the smaller probe sizes that should result in fewer perturbations to proteins and to biological systems as a whole. Despite the research in this area, so far none of these labeling techniques permit labeling and imaging of selected endogenous proteins in living cells.Researchers have widely used affinity labeling, in which the protein of interest is labeled by a reactive group attached to a ligand, to identify and characterize proteins. Since the first report of affinity labeling in the early 1960s, efforts to fine-tune the chemical structures of both the reactive group and ligand have led to protein labeling with excellent target selectivity in the whole proteome of living cells. Although the chemical probes used for affinity labeling generally inactivate target proteins, this strategy holds promise as a valuable tool for the labeling and imaging of endogenous proteins in living cells and by extension in living animals.In this Account, we summarize traceless affinity labeling, a technique explored mainly in our laboratory. In our overview of the different labeling techniques, we emphasize the challenge of designing chemical probes that allow for dissociation of the affinity module (often a ligand) after the labeling reaction so that the labeled protein retains its native function. This feature distinguishes the traceless labeling approach from the traditional affinity labeling method and allows for real-time monitoring of protein activity. With the high target specificity and biocompatibility of this technique, we have achieved individual labeling and imaging of endogenously expressed proteins in samples of high biological complexity. We also highlight applications in which our current approach enabled the monitoring of important biological events, such as ligand binding, in living cells.

Here, we have engineered biomaterials to present the genetic inducer, IPTG, with different modes of activating genetic circuits in vitro and in vivo. Gene circuits were activated in materials with IPTG embedded within the scaffold walls or chemically linked to the matrix. In addition, systemic applications of IPTG were used to induce genetic circuits in cells encapsulated into materials and implanted in vivo. The flexibility of modifying biomaterials with genetic inducers allows for patterned placement of these inducers that can be used to generate distinct patterns of gene expression. Together, these genetically interactive materials can be used to characterize genetic circuits in environments that more closely mimic cells' natural 3D settings, to better explore complex cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, and to facilitate therapeutic applications of synthetic biology.

To unravel the basic scaffold underlying the NPC, we have characterized the species-specific scaffold nucleoporin Nup37 and ELY5/ELYS. Both proteins integrate directly via Nup120/160 into the universally conserved heptameric Y-complex, the critical unit for the assembly and functionality of the NPC. We present the crystal structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Nup37 in complex with Nup120, a 174-kDa subassembly that forms one of the two short arms of the Y-complex. Nup37 binds near the bend of the L-shaped Nup120 protein, potentially stabilizing the relative orientation of its two domains. By means of reconstitution assays, we pinpoint residues crucial for this interaction. In vivo and in vitro results show that ELY5 binds near an interface of the Nup120-Nup37 complex. Complementary biochemical and cell biological data refine and consolidate the interactions of Nup120 within the current Y-model. Finally, we propose an orientation of the Y-complex relative to the pore membrane, consistent with the lattice model.

In various organisms, complex I can be replaced by the alternative NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-2), which catalyzes the transfer of an electron from NADH via FAD to quinone, without proton pumping. The Ndi1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a monotopic membrane protein, directed to the matrix. A number of studies have investigated the potential use of Ndi1 as a therapeutic agent against complex I disorders, and the NDH-2 enzymes have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for treatments against the causative agents of malaria and tuberculosis. Here we present the crystal structures of Ndi1 in its substrate-free, NAD(+)-and ubiquinone-(UQ2) complexed states. The structures reveal that Ndi1 is a peripheral membrane protein forming an intimate dimer, in which packing of the monomeric units within the dimer creates an amphiphilic membrane-anchor domain structure. Crucially, the structures of the Ndi1-NAD(+) and Ndi1-UQ2 complexes show overlapping binding sites for the NAD(+) and quinone substrates.

We report here a fully automated design methodology and experimental validation of synthetic RNA interaction circuits working in a cellular environment. The computational algorithm, based on a physicochemical model, produces novel RNA sequences by exploring the space of possible sequences compatible with predefined structures. We tested our methodology in Escherichia coli by designing several positive riboregulators with diverse structures and interaction models, suggesting that only the energy of formation and the activation energy (free energy barrier to overcome for initiating the hybridization reaction) are sufficient criteria to engineer RNA interaction and regulation in bacteria. The designed sequences exhibit nonsignificant similarity to any known noncoding RNA sequence. Our riboregulatory devices work independently and in combination with transcription regulation to create complex logic circuits. Our results demonstrate that a computational methodology based on first-principles can be used to engineer interacting RNAs with allosteric behavior in living cells.

These coregulations have been used, in a few instances, to infer global transcriptional regulatory models. Here, using the large amount of transcriptomic information available for the bacterium Escherichia coli, we seek to understand the design principles determining the regulation of its transcriptome. Combining transcriptomic and signaling data, we develop an evolutionary computational procedure that allows obtaining alternative genomic transcriptional regulatory network (GTRN) that still maintains its adaptability to dynamic environments. We apply our methodology to an E. coli GTRN and show that it could be rewired to simpler transcriptional regulatory structures. These rewired GTRNs still maintain the global physiological response to fluctuating environments. Rewired GTRNs contain 73% fewer regulated operons. Genes with similar functions and coordinated patterns of expression across environments are clustered into longer regulated operons. These synthetic GTRNs are more sensitive and show a more robust response to challenging environments. This result illustrates that the natural configuration of E. coli GTRN does not necessarily result from selection for robustness to environmental perturbations, but that evolutionary contingencies may have been important as well. We also discuss the limitations of our methodology in the context of the demand theory. Our procedure will be useful as a novel way to analyze global transcription regulation networks and in synthetic biology for the de novo design of genomes.

Various lengths of A beta peptide are generated by proteolytic cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mutations in many familial AD-associated genes affect the production of the longer A beta 42 variant that preferentially accumulates in plaques. In the case of sporadic or late-onset AD, which accounts for greater than 95% of cases, several genes are implicated in increasing the risk, but whether they also cause the disease by altering amyloid levels is currently unknown. Through loss of function studies in a model cell line, here RNAi-mediated silencing of several late onset AD genes affected A beta levels is shown. However, unlike the genes underlying familial AD, late onset AD-susceptibility genes do not specifically alter the A beta 42/40 ratios and suggest that these genes probably contribute to AD through distinct mechanisms.

Deletion of the X-chromosome-encoded UTX gene in male ES cells markedly decreases expression of the paralogous UTY gene encoded by Y chromosome, but has no effect on global H3K27me3 level, Hox gene expression, or ES cell self-renewal. However, UTX KO cells show severe defects in mesoderm differentiation and induction of Brachyury, a transcription factor essential for mesoderm development. Surprisingly, UTX regulates mesoderm differentiation and Brachyury expression independent of its enzymatic activity. UTY, which lacks detectable demethylase activity, compensates for the loss of UTX in regulating Brachyury expression. UTX and UTY bind directly to Brachyury promoter and are required for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling-induced Brachyury expression in ES cells. Interestingly, male UTX KO embryos express normal levels of UTY and survive until birth. In contrast, female UTX KO mice, which lack the UTY gene, show embryonic lethality before embryonic day 11.5. Female UTX KO embryos show severe defects in both Brachyury expression and embryonic development of mesoderm-derived posterior notochord, cardiac, and hematopoietic tissues. These results indicate that UTX controls mesoderm differentiation and Brachyury expression independent of H3K27 demethylase activity, and suggest that UTX and UTY are functionally redundant in ES cell differentiation and early embryonic development.

To address these challenges, we developed an antibody-free strategy that involves PRISM (high-pressure, high-resolution separations coupled with intelligent selection and multiplexing) for sensitive selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-based targeted protein quantification. The strategy capitalizes on high-resolution reversed-phase liquid chromatographic separations for analyte enrichment, intelligent selection of target fractions via on-line SRM monitoring of internal standards, and fraction multiplexing before nano-liquid chromatography-SRM quantification. Application of this strategy to human plasma/serum demonstrated accurate and reproducible quantification of proteins at concentrations in the 50-100 pg/mL range, which represents a major advance in the sensitivity of targeted protein quantification without the need for specific-affinity reagents. Application to a set of clinical serum samples illustrated an excellent correlation between the results obtained from the PRISM-SRM assay and those from clinical immunoassay for the prostate-specific antigen level.

This recognition causes activation of the MASP-2 or the C1s serine proteases followed by cleavage of the protein C4. Here we present the crystal structures of the 203-kDa human C4 and the 245-kDa C4.MASP-2 substrate.enzyme complex. When C4 binds to MASP-2, substantial conformational changes in C4 are induced, and its scissile bond region becomes ordered and inserted into the protease catalytic site in a manner canonical to serine proteases. In MASP-2, an exosite located within the CCP domains recognizes the C4 C345C domain 60 angstrom from the scissile bond. Mutations in C4 and MASP-2 residues at the C345C-CCP interface inhibit the intermolecular interaction and C4 cleavage. The possible assembly of the huge in vivo enzyme-substrate complex consisting of glycan-bound mannan-binding lectin, MASP-2, and C4 is discussed. Our own and prior functional data suggest that C1s in the classical pathway of complement activated by, e. g., antigen-antibody complexes, also recognizes the C4 C345C domain through a CCP exosite. Our results provide a unified structural framework for understanding the early and essential step of C4 cleavage in the elimination of pathogens and altered self through two major pathways of complement activation.

The marginal mass of islets surviving the serial peritransplant insults may lead to exhaustion and thereby contribute to an unacceptably high rate of intermediate and long-term graft loss. Hence, we have studied the effects of treatment with alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) in a syngeneic nonautoimmune islet graft model. A marginal number of syngeneic mouse islets were transplanted into nonautoimmune diabetic hosts and islet function was analyzed in control and AAT treated hosts. In untreated controls, marginal mass islet transplants did not restore euglycemia. Outcomes were dramatically improved by short-term AAT treatment. Transcriptional profiling identified 1,184 differentially expressed transcripts in AAT-treated hosts at 3 d posttransplantation. Systems-biology-based analysis revealed AAT down-regulated regulatory hubs formed by inflammation-related molecules (e. g., TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B). The conclusions yielded by the systems-biology analysis were rigorously confirmed by QRT-PCR and immunohistology. These data suggest that short-term AAT treatment of human islet transplant recipients may be worthy of a clinical trial.

The first was the postglacial transition from a brackish-water to a marine ecosystem dominated by porpoises and dolphins once this basin was reconnected back to the Mediterranean Sea (ca. 8,000 y B. P.). The second occurred during the past decades, when overfishing and hunting activities brought these predators close to extinction, having a deep impact on the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem. Estimating the extent of this decimation is essential for characterizing this ecosystem's dynamics and for formulating restoration plans. However, this extent is poorly documented in historical records. We addressed this issue for one of the main Black Sea predators, the harbor porpoise, using a population genetics approach. Analyzing its genetic diversity using an approximate Bayesian computation approach, we show that only a demographic expansion (at most 5,000 y ago) followed by a contemporaneous population collapse can explain the observed genetic data. We demonstrate that both the postglacial settlement of harbor porpoises in the Black Sea and the recent anthropogenic activities have left a clear footprint on their genetic diversity. Specifically, we infer a strong population reduction (similar to 90%) that occurred within the past 5 decades, which can therefore clearly be related to the recent massive killing of small cetaceans and to the continuing incidental catches in commercial fisheries. Our study thus provides a quantitative assessment of these demographically catastrophic events, also showing that two separate historical events can be inferred from contemporary genetic data.

A long-standing question in biology is how cells control their size. Escherichia coli adjusts size and growth rate according to the availability of nutrients so that it grows larger and faster in nutrient-rich media than in nutrient-poor media. Here, we describe how, using classical genetics, we have isolated a remarkably small E. coli mutant that has undergone a 70% reduction in cell volume with respect to wild type. This mutant lacks FabH, an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis that previously was thought to be essential for the viability of E. coli. We demonstrate that although FabH is not essential in wild-type E. coli, it is essential in cells that are defective in the production of the small-molecule and global regulator ppGpp. Furthermore, we have found that the loss of FabH causes a reduction in the rate of envelope growth and renders cells unable to regulate cell size properly in response to nutrient excess. Therefore we propose a model in which fatty acid biosynthesis plays a central role in regulating the size of E. coli cells in response to nutrient availability.

This type of confinement allows a study that provides unique insight into the dynamic structure of an unfolded, flexible protein which is still solvated and thus under near-physiological conditions. In a model system, the protein osteopontin (OPN) is used. It is a highly phosphorylated glycoprotein that is expressed in a wide range of cells and tissues for which limited structural analysis exists due to the high degree of flexibility and large number of post-translational modifications. OPN is implicated in tissue functions, such as inflammation and mineralisation. It also has a key function in tumour metastasis and progression. Circular dichroism measurements show that confinement enhances the secondary structural features of the protein. Small-angle X-ray scattering and dynamic light scattering show that OPN changes from being a flexible protein in aqueous solution to adopting a less flexible and more compact structure inside the microemulsion droplets. This novel approach for confining proteins while they are still hydrated may aid in studying the structure of a wide range of natively unfolded proteins.

To add to the growing collection of Brachypodium resources available to plant scientists, we further optimized our Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated high-efficiency transformation method and generated 8,491 Brachypodium T-DNA lines. We used inverse PCR to sequence the DNA flanking the insertion sites in the mutants. Using these flanking sequence tags (FSTs) we were able to assign 7,389 FSTs from 4,402 T-DNA mutants to 5,285 specific insertion sites (ISs) in the Brachypodium genome. More than 29% of the assigned ISs are supported by multiple FSTs. T-DNA insertions span the entire genome with an average of 19.3 insertions/Mb. The distribution of T-DNA insertions is non-uniform with a larger number of insertions at the distal ends compared to the centromeric regions of the chromosomes. Insertions are correlated with genic regions, but are biased toward UTRs and non-coding regions within 1 kb of genes over exons and intron regions.

Elucidating the communication among them is important to understanding disease pathophysiology. In this study we integrate multiple tissue gene expression and quantitative trait measurements of an obesity-induced diabetes mouse model, with databases of molecular interaction networks, to construct a cross tissue trait-pathway network. The animals belong to two strains of mice (BTBR or B6), of two obesity status (obese or lean), and at two different ages (4 weeks and 10 weeks). Only 10 week obese BTBR animals are diabetic. The expression data was first utilized to determine the state of every pathway in each tissue, which is subsequently utilized to construct a pathway co-expression network and to define trait-relevant and trait-linking pathways. Among the six tissues profiled, the adipose contains the largest number of trait-linking pathways. Among the eight traits measured, the body weight and plasma insulin level possess the most number of relevant and linking pathways. Topological analysis of the trait-pathway network revealed that the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway in liver and the insulin signaling pathway in muscle are of top importance to the information flow in the network, with the highest degrees and betweenness centralities. Interestingly, pathways related to metabolism and oxidative stress actively interact with many other pathways in all animals, whereas, among the 10 week animals, the inflammation pathways were preferentially interactive in the diabetic ones only. In summary, our method offers a systems approach to delineate disease trait relevant intra-and cross tissue pathway interactions, and provides insights to the molecular basis of the obesity-induced diabetes.

We also stained the tissue/cells for Ki-67, and Caspase-3. We measured matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in the conditioned media and in blood plasma from patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Organized tumor nodules with intact vascular space formed in the ex vivo 3D lung model but not in 2D culture. Proliferation and apoptosis were greater in the ex vivo 3D lung model compared to the 2D culture. After 15 days, there were significantly more cells in the 2D culture than the 3D model.

From a forward genetic approach to identify novel genes involved in lung formation, we identified a mutated Nubp1 gene, which leads to syndactyly, eye cataract and lung hypoplasia. In the lung, Nubp1 is expressed in progenitor cells of the distal epithelium. Nubp1(m1Nisw) mutants show increased apoptosis accompanied by a loss of the distal progenitor markers Sftpc, Sox9 and Foxp2. In addition, Nubp1 mutation disrupts localization of the polarity protein Par3 and the mitosis relevant protein Numb. Using knock-down studies in lung epithelial cells, we also demonstrate a function of Nubp1 in regulating centrosome dynamics and microtubule organization. Together, Nubp1 represents an essential protein for lung progenitor survival by coordinating vital cellular processes including cell polarity and centrosomal dynamics.

The development of this reprogramming technology not only makes it possible to perform basic research on human stem cells that do not have to be derived from embryos, but also allows patient-specific cells and tissues to be generated for therapeutic use. Optimizing this process will probably lead to a better and more efficient means of generating pluripotent stem cells. Here, we discuss recent findings that show that, in addition to transcription factors, microRNAs can promote pluripotent reprogramming and can even substitute for these pluripotency transcription factors in some cases. Taking into consideration that microRNAs have the potential to be used as small-molecule therapeutics, such findings open new possibilities for both pluripotent stem cell reprogramming and the reprogramming of cells into other cell lineages.

However, the clinical application of TGF-beta inhibitors remains uncertain as genetic studies show a tumor suppressor function of TGF-beta in pancreatic cancer and other epithelial malignancies. Here, we used genetically engineered mouse models to investigate the therapeutic impact of global TGF-beta inhibition in pancreatic cancer in relation to tumor stage, genetic profile, and concurrent chemotherapy. We found that alpha v beta 6 integrin acted as a key upstream activator of TGF-beta in evolving pancreatic cancers. In addition, TGF-beta or alpha v beta 6 blockade increased tumor cell proliferation and accelerated both early and later disease stages. These effects were dependent on the presence of Smad4, a central mediator of TGF-beta signaling. Therefore, our findings indicate that alpha v beta 6 and TGF-beta act in a common tumor suppressor pathway whose pharmacologic inactivation promotes pancreatic cancer progression.

The study was conducted in south-eastern Madagascar in a steep transition zone along an altitudinal and a sharp precipitation gradient between a high altitude rainforest and a lowland dry tropical forest. The restoration of gaps created by abandoned fields in this narrow, winding corridor could be essential to maintain connectivity between two areas (areas 1 and 2) of Andohahela National Park. Prior to implementing restoration, baseline ecological information is needed on the reference ecosystem and vegetation resilience must be studied to identify restoration needs. This study aims to (1) assess whether cultivation practices (irrigated rice vs. cassava, maize and sweet potato) influence vegetation dynamics after abandonment; (2) study vegetation dynamics and soils over time since abandonment, and (3) compare secondary forest vegetation and soils with those of mature forest patches. Surveys of vegetation and soil were conducted in 26 secondary forest patches abandoned from 3 to >25 years (synchronic approach) and in 19 adjacent mature forest patches (controls). No relationship between age of abandonment and vegetation species richness, composition or structure was found, but clear differences were detected between secondary and mature forest patches. Secondary forests are not colonized by species from mature forests, but instead their vegetation dynamics appear to lead to the establishment of thorny thickets dominated by Mimosa delicatula, which is absent from the mature forest.

Central and peripheral tolerance hinder the contribution of high-avidity clonotypes targeting residues 206-214 of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP(206-214)) during the earliest stages of autoimmune diabetes. In this study, we probe the molecular determinants and biochemical consequences of IGRP(206-214)/K-d recognition by high-, intermediate-, and low-avidity autoreactive CD8(+) T cells, and we investigate the effects of genetic IGRP(206-214) silencing on their developmental biology. We find that differences in avidity for IGRP(206-214)/K-d map to CDR1 alpha and are associated with quantitative differences in CD3 epsilon proline-rich sequence exposure and Nck recruitment. Unexpectedly, we find that tolerance of high-avidity CD8(+) T cells, unlike their activation and recruitment into the pancreas, is dissociated from recognition of IGRP(206-214), particularly in adult mice. This finding challenges the view that tolerance of pathogenic autoreactive T cells is invariably triggered by recognition of the peptide-MHC complex that drives their activation in the periphery, indicating the existence of mechanisms of tolerance that are capable of sensing the avidity, hence pathogenicity of autoreactive T cells without the need to rely on local autoantigen availability.

This underscores the importance of system-wide approaches for linking different scales of drug actions; namely drug-protein interactions (molecular scale) and side effects (phenotypic scale) toward side effect prediction for uncharacterized drugs.Results: We performed a large-scale analysis to extract correlated sets of targeted proteins and side effects, based on the co-occurrence of drugs in protein-binding profiles and side effect profiles, using sparse canonical correlation analysis. The analysis of 658 drugs with the two profiles for 1368 proteins and 1339 side effects led to the extraction of 80 correlated sets. Enrichment analyses using KEGG and Gene Ontology showed that most of the correlated sets were significantly enriched with proteins that are involved in the same biological pathways, even if their molecular functions are different. This allowed for a biologically relevant interpretation regarding the relationship between drug-targeted proteins and side effects. The extracted side effects can be regarded as possible phenotypic outcomes by drugs targeting the proteins that appear in the same correlated set. The proposed method is expected to be useful for predicting potential side effects of new drug candidate compounds based on their protein-binding profiles.

Often, external stimulation of cells by compounds such as drugs or hormones leading to activation has to be considered. Mathematically, the stimulus is represented by a time-dependent input function.Parameters such as rate constants of the molecular interactions are often unknown and need to be estimated from experimental data, e.g. by maximum likelihood estimation. For this purpose, the input function has to be defined for all times of the integration interval. This is usually achieved by approximating the input by interpolation or smoothing of the measured data. This procedure is suboptimal since the input uncertainties are not considered in the estimation process which often leads to overoptimistic confidence intervals of the inferred parameters and the model dynamics.Results: This article presents a new approach which includes the input estimation into the estimation process of the dynamical model parameters by minimizing an objective function containing all parameters simultaneously. We applied this comprehensive approach to an illustrative model with simulated data and compared it to alternative methods. Statistical analyses revealed that our method improves the prediction of the model dynamics and the confidence intervals leading to a proper coverage of the confidence intervals of the dynamic parameters. The method was applied to the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

State-of-the-art data analysis provides lists of involved genes, either by calculating significance levels of mRNA abundance or by Bayesian assessments of gene activity. A common problem of such approaches is the difficulty of interpreting the biological implication of the resulting gene lists. This lead to an increased interest in methods for inferring high-level biological information. A common approach for representing high level information is by inferring gene ontology (GO) terms which may be attributed to the expression data experiment.Results: This article proposes a probabilistic model for GO term inference. Modelling assumes that gene annotations to GO terms are available and gene involvement in an experiment is represented by a posterior probabilities over gene-specific indicator variables. Such probability measures result from many Bayesian approaches for expression data analysis. The proposed model combines these indicator probabilities in a probabilistic fashion and provides a probabilistic GO term assignment as a result. Experiments on synthetic and microarray data suggest that advantages of the proposed probabilistic GO term inference over statistical test-based approaches are in particular evident for sparsely annotated GO terms and in situations of large uncertainty about gene activity. Provided that appropriate annotations exist, the proposed approach is easily applied to inferring other high level assignments like pathways.

Experimental limitations such as sparse and noisy data result in unidentifiable parameters and render-related design tasks challenging problems. Often, the temporal resolution of data is a limiting factor and the amount of possible experimental interventions is finite. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian experiment design algorithm to minimize the prediction uncertainty for a given set of experiments and compare it to traditional A-optimal design.Results: In an in depth numerical study involving an ordinary differential equation model of the trans-Golgi network with 12 partly non-identifiable parameters, we minimized the prediction uncertainty efficiently for predefined scenarios. The introduced method results in twice the prediction precision as the same amount of A-optimal designed experiments while introducing a useful stopping criterion. The simulation intensity of the algorithm's major design step is thereby reasonably affordable. Besides smaller variances in the predicted trajectories compared with Fisher design, we could also achieve smaller parameter posterior distribution entropies, rendering this method superior to A-optimal Fisher design also in the parameter space.

Fish of both sexes were sampled in monthly intervals between April and August in order to cover the onset of gametogenesis. Investigated parameters included gonad histology, plasma levels of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) as well as the expression of gonadotropin subunits in the pituitary. Furthermore, the mRNA-expression of brain-type aromatase (cyp19a1b), androgen receptor (ar), and estrogen receptor isoforms was studied at the pituitary level. The onset of gametogenesis - as indicated by follicles with cortical alveoli in females and first spermatogonia B in males - was observed in July, accompanied by a significant up-regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone beta (fsh beta) mRNA in the pituitary in both sexes. On the other hand, luteinizing hormone beta (lh beta) mRNA increased later on in August. In males, the increase of fsh beta mRNA in July coincided with a rise in plasma 11-KT concentrations. In females, E2 in plasma increased later, not until August, shortly before true vitellogenesis (late cortical alveoli stage). Expression of sex steroid receptors in the pituitary revealed only minor seasonal fluctuations. Most pronounced, ar mRNA displayed the highest level pre-spawning in both sexes. Interestingly, cyp19a1b mRNA-expression in the pituitary increased in parallel with fsh beta already before any changes in plasma E2 or T occurred. These data suggest an important role of pituitary FSH and aromatase at the onset of gametogenesis in the roach. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent reports suggest that GLP-1 agonists may also have distant effects including C-cell thyroid hyperplasia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exendin-4 on the thyroid and parathyroid cells in a rat model.Rat thyroids were stained for calcitonin, H&E and for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Thyroid C-cell hyperplasia was graded on H&E stained slides using cell size and secretory granule numbers, morphological features of the parathyroid glands and the serum calcium concentrations of the rats were also evaluated. Counts of stained cells/high power field and intensity of staining were recorded by two pathologists. Data were analyzed by ANOVA/post-tests.C cell hypertrophy was elevated in exenatide-treated vs. untreated animals (22.5 perpendicular to 8.7 vs. 10.5 perpendicular to 2.7cells/HPF). CEA staining failed to show effects by exendin. Calcitonin staining was significantly elevated in exenatide treated controls (P<0.001). Parathyroid glands were histologically normal in both groups, and serum calcium levels were within normal range in all animals. In summary, exenatide was associated with C cell hyperplasia and increased calcitonin staining of thyroids, but was unrelated to CEA levels. These data raise important concerns about the effects of exenatide which, given its wide clinical use, should be clarified with urgency. Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pristionchus pacificus was the first non-plant parasitic nematode that was found to contain cellulase genes in its genome and to have cellulolytic activity when grown in a monoxenic culture on Escherichia coli. The P. pacificus reference strain PS312 has seven cellulase genes, all of which were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Previous phylogenomic studies indicated that the acquisition occurred at the base of the genus Pristionchus and was followed by rapid gene duplications and gene turnover. However, little was known about the protein domain architecture, gene expression and the functionality of individual proteins. Here, we analyzed the protein domain architecture, studied the expression at various developmentally stages and tried to induce cellulase gene expression by feeding nematodes with different polysaccharides. Only two of the encoded proteins, Ppa-CEL-2 and Ppa-CEL-3, have a carbohydrate-binding module. Interestingly, these were also the ones with developmental gene expression regulation. Ppa-cel-2 shows high expression in larval and adult stages but is only low expressed in eggs, while Ppa-cel-3 is highly upregulated in adult worms but hardly detectable in any other stage. Ppa-CEL-1, has a catalytic domain similar to Ppa-CEL-2 and Ppa-CEL-3, but lacks a carbohydrate-binding module. The other four cellulases have a very low transcriptional expression correlating with putative incompleteness of their catalytic domain. While, the expression of none of the genes is inducible by polysaccharides, zymographic studies and mass spectrometry indicate that Ppa-CEL-2 and Ppa-CEL-3 are the only two cellulases contributing to cellulase activity in carboxymethylcellulose. Thus, the cellulases of P. pacificus differ in their protein domain architecture, gene expression and functionality. These results indicate that horizontal gene transfer-acquired genes undergo rapid evolutionary changes that affect all aspects of their molecular biology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A defect in this proteolytic event, caused by a mutation in the lamin A gene (LMNA) that eliminates the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site, underlies the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). Likewise, mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene that result in decreased enzyme function cause a spectrum of diseases that share certain features of premature aging. Twenty human ZMPSTE24 alleles have been identified that are associated with three disease categories of increasing severity: mandibuloacral dysplasia type B (MAD-B), severe progeria (atypical oHGPS') and restrictive dermopathy (RD). To determine whether a correlation exists between decreasing ZMPSTE24 protease activity and increasing disease severity, we expressed mutant alleles of ZMPSTE24 in yeast and optimized in vivo yeast mating assays to directly compare the activity of alleles associated with each disease category. We also measured the activity of yeast crude membranes containing the ZMPSTE24 mutant proteins in vitro. We determined that, in general, the residual activity of ZMPSTE24 patient alleles correlates with disease severity. Complete loss-of-function alleles are associated with RD, whereas retention of partial, measureable activity results in MAD-B or severe progeria. Importantly, our assays can discriminate small differences in activity among the mutants, confirming that the methods presented here will be useful for characterizing any new ZMPSTE24 mutations that are discovered.

Benefits will come from the possibility of modelling human diseases and develop individualised therapies, and from their use in transplantation and bioengineering. The use of autologous stem cells is highly desirable, as it avoids the problem of tissue rejection, and also reduces ethical and regulatory issues.

Both enzymes were compact tetrameric molecules with subunits that, despite their size differences and the large phylogenetic separation between the two organisms, presented a striking structural similarity for about 460 residues. The high conservation, confirmed in all the subsequent structures determined, suggested a strong pressure to preserve a functional catalase fold, which is almost exclusively found in these mono-functional heme catalases. However, even in the absence of the catalase fold an efficient catalase activity is also found in the heme containing catalase-peroxidase proteins. The structure of these broad substrate range enzymes, reported for the first time less than ten years ago from the halophilic archaebacterium Haloarcula marismortui (HmCPx) and from the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei (BpKatG), showed a heme pocket closely related to that of plant peroxidases, though with a number of unique modifications that enable the catalase reaction. Despite the wealth of structural information already available, for both monofunctional catalases and catalase-peroxidases, a number of unanswered major questions require continuing structural research with truly innovative approaches.

The hydrophobicity of their native ligand shell, however, is a significant barrier to their aqueous transfer as single particles. Ligand exchange with hydrophilic small molecules or, alternatively, wrapping over native ligands with amphiphilic polymers is widely employed for aqueous transfer; however, purification can be quite cumbersome. We report here a general two-step method whereby reactive stripping of native ligands is first carried out using trialkyloxonium salts to reveal a bare nanocrystal surface. This is followed by chemically directed immobilization of a hydrophilic polymer coating. Polyacrylic acids, with side-chain grafts or functional end groups, were found to be extremely versatile in this regard. The resulting polymer-wrapped nanocrystal dispersions retained much of the compact size of their bare nanocrystal precursors, highlighting the unique role of monomer side-chain functionality to serve as effective, conformal ligation motifs. As such, they are well poised for applications where tailored chemical functionality at the nanocrystal's periphery or improved access to their surfaces is desirable. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, standard implementation of the GS method restricts its utilization in parallel computing due to its requirement of using updated neighboring values (i.e., in current iteration) as soon as they are available. Here, we report an efficient and exact (not requiring assumptions) method to parallelize iterations and to reduce the computational time as a linear/nearly linear function of the number of processes or computing units. In contrast to other existing solutions, our method does not require any assumptions and is equally applicable for solving linear and nonlinear equations. This approach is implemented in the DelPhi program, which is a finite difference PoissonBoltzmann equation solver to model electrostatics in molecular biology. This development makes the iterative procedure on obtaining the electrostatic potential distribution in the parallelized DelPhi several folds faster than that in the serial code. Further, we demonstrate the advantages of the new parallelized DelPhi by computing the electrostatic potential and the corresponding energies of large supramolecular structures.

Contrastingly, within the invertebrates there have been considerably less examples both from laboratory and field investigations. This has in part been due to a focus of female related endpoints, inadequate biomarkers and the low number of studies. Whether contaminant induced male infertility is an issue within aquatic invertebrates and their wider communities therefore remains largely unknown and represents a key knowledge gap in our understanding of pollutant impacts in aquatic wildlife. This paper reviews the current knowledge regarding pollutants impacting male infertility across several aquatic invertebrate phyla; which biomarkers are currently being used and where the science needs to be expanded. The limited studies conducted so far have revealed reductions in sperm numbers, examples of poor fertilisation success, DNA damage to spermatozoa and inhibition of sperm motility that can be induced by a range of environmental contaminants. This limited data is mainly comprised from laboratory studies with only a few studies of sperm toxicity in natural populations. Clearly, there is a need for further studies in this area, to include both laboratory and field studies from clean and reference sites, with a focus on broadcast spawners and those with direct fertilisation. Biomarkers developed for measuring sperm quantity and quality in vertebrates are easily transferable to invertebrates but require optimisation for particular species. We discuss how sperm tracking and techniques for measuring DNA strand breaks and sperm viability have been successfully transferred from human infertility clinics to aquatic invertebrate ecotoxicology. Linking sperm toxicity and male infertility effects to higher level impacts on the reproductive biology and dynamics of populations requires a much greater understanding of fertilisation dynamics and sperm competition/limitation for invertebrate species and represents the next challenge in our understanding of male toxicity effects in natural populations.

In this study we report the effect of reductive and microaerobic conditions on wine aroma compound production using different initial amounts of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN: 180 and 400 mg N/l) in a simil grape must defined medium and two S. cerevisiae strains commonly used in wine-making. In batch fermentation culture conditions, reductive conditions were obtained using flasks plugged with Muller valves filled with sulphuric acid; while microaerobic conditions were attained with defined cotton plugs. It was found that significant differences in redox potential were obtained using the different plugs, and with variation of over 100 mV during the main fermentation period.Significant differences in the final concentration of higher alcohols, esters and fatty acids were attributed to differences in the redox state in the medium in both strains. A consistent increase in esters and medium chain fatty acids, as well as a decrease of higher alcohols and isoacids, was seen under reductive fermentation conditions. Interestingly, 1-propanol, delta-butyrolactone and ethyl lactate concentrations, showed no significant variation under the different redox conditions. A better understanding of the influence of redox state of the fermentation medium on the composition of volatile compounds in wine could enable improvement of vinification management.

Like several human lymphomas the neoplastic MD lymphoma cells overexpress the CD30 antigen (CD30(hi)) and are in minority, while the non-neoplastic cells (CD30(lo)) form the majority of population. MD is a unique natural in-vivo model of human CD30(hi) lymphomas with both natural CD30(hi) lymphomagenesis and spontaneous regression. The exact mechanism of neoplastic transformation from CD30(lo) expressing phenotype to CD30(hi) expressing neoplastic phenotype is unknown. Here, using microarray, proteomics and Systems Biology modeling; we compare the global gene expression of CD30(lo) and CD30(hi) cells to identify key pathways of neoplastic transformation. We propose and test a specific mechanism of neoplastic transformation, and genetic resistance, involving the MDV oncogene Meq, host gene products of the Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kappa B) family and CD30; we also identify a novel Meq protein interactome.Results: Our results show that a) CD30(lo) lymphocytes are pre-neoplastic precursors and not merely reactive lymphocytes; b) multiple transformation mechanisms exist and are potentially controlled by Meq; c) Meq can drive a feed-forward cycle that induces CD30 transcription, increases CD30 signaling which activates NF-kappa B, and, in turn, increases Meq transcription; d) Meq transcriptional repression or activation of the CD30 promoter generally correlates with polymorphisms in the CD30 promoter distinguishing MD-lymphoma resistant and susceptible chicken genotypes e) MDV oncoprotein Meq interacts with proteins involved in physiological processes central to lymphomagenesis.Conclusions: In the context of the MD lymphoma microenvironment (and potentially in other CD30(hi) lymphomas as well), our results show that the neoplastic transformation is a continuum and the non-neoplastic cells are actually pre-neoplastic precursor cells and not merely immune bystanders. We also show that NF-kappa B is a central player in MDV induced neoplastic transformation of CD30-expressing lymphocytes in vivo.

Sensing is achieved via geomagnetic-dependent dynamics of the spins of the unpaired electrons.

Detailed features involved in cell growth, differentiation and death during lignification were characterized by laser scanning microscopic imaging. Changes in transcript levels of xylogenesis-related genes were assessed by RT-PCR, which showed that the transcription of key genes like PAL1, C4H, CCoAOMT, and CCR was induced at day 4 under LG conditions. Furthermore, interunit linkage of lignins was compared between mature bamboo culms and xylogenic suspension cells by heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy. The presence of the most common interunit linkages, including beta-aryl ether (beta-O-4), phenylcoumaran (beta-5) and resinol (beta-beta) structures was identified in the bamboo cultured cell lignin (BCCL) by HSQC NMR. In addition to these common features of lignin, several differences in lignin substructures were also found between the BCCL and the bamboo milled wood lignin (BMWL).Conclusions: Our xylogenic suspension culture model could be used for detailed characterization of physiological and molecular biological events in living bamboo cells.

Here, we used quantitative redox proteomics to determine the onset and the cellular targets of oxidative stress during Caenorhabditis elegans' life span. In parallel, we used genetically encoded sensor proteins to determine peroxide levels in live animals in real time. We discovered that C. elegans encounters significant levels of oxidants as early as during larval development. Oxidant levels drop rapidly as animals mature, and reducing conditions prevail throughout the reproductive age, after which age-accompanied protein oxidation sets in. Long-lived daf-2 mutants transition faster to reducing conditions, whereas short-lived daf-16 mutants retain higher oxidant levels throughout their mature life. These results suggest that animals with improved capacity to recover from early oxidative stress have significant advantages later in life.

Hence, an understanding of how these multiprotein complexes form is a fundamental question in cell biology. We developed a translation-controlled pulse-chase system that allows time-resolved isolation of newly forming multiprotein complexes in chemical quantities suitable for biochemical and cell biological analysis. The ""pulse"" is triggered by an unnatural amino acid, which induces immediate translation of an amber stop codon repressed mRNA encoding the protein of interest with a built-in tag for detection and purification. The ""chase"" is elicited by stopping translation of this bait via a riboswitch in the respective mRNA. Over the course of validating our method, we discovered a distinct time-resolved assembly step during NPC biogenesis and could directly monitor the spatiotemporal maturation of preribosomes via immunofluorescence detection and purification of a pulse-labeled ribosomal protein. Thus, we provide an innovative strategy to study dynamic protein assembly within cellular networks.

However, clinical translation will require preclinical optimization and validation of large-animal iPSC models.Objective: To successfully derive endothelial cells from porcine iPSCs and demonstrate their potential utility for the treatment of myocardial ischemia.Methods and Results: Porcine adipose stromal cells were reprogrammed to generate porcine iPSCs (piPSCs). Immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, microarray hybridization, and angiogenic assays confirmed that piPSC-derived endothelial cells (piPSC-ECs) shared similar morphological and functional properties as endothelial cells isolated from the autologous pig aorta. To demonstrate their therapeutic potential, piPSC-ECs were transplanted into mice with myocardial infarction. Compared with control, animals transplanted with piPSC-ECs showed significant functional improvement measured by echocardiography (fractional shortening at week 4: 27.2 +/- 1.3% versus 22.3 +/- 1.1%; P<0.001) and MRI (ejection fraction at week 4: 45.8 +/- 1.3% versus 42.3 +/- 0.9%; P<0.05). Quantitative protein assays and microfluidic single-cell PCR profiling showed that piPSC-ECs released proangiogenic and antiapoptotic factors in the ischemic microenvironment, which promoted neovascularization and cardiomyocyte survival, respectively. Release of paracrine factors varied significantly among subpopulations of transplanted cells, suggesting that transplantation of specific cell populations may result in greater functional recovery.Conclusions: In summary, this is the first study to successfully differentiate piPSCs-ECs from piPSCs and demonstrate that transplantation of piPSC-ECs improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction via paracrine activation. Further development of these large animal iPSC models will yield significant insights into their therapeutic potential and accelerate the clinical translation of autologous iPSC-based therapy.

Co-expression networks model mRNA co-expression: the product of gene regulatory networks. To identify regulatory mechanisms underlying coordinated gene expression in a tissue-enriched context, ten Arabidopsis thaliana co-expression networks were constructed after manually sorting 4,566 RNA profiling datasets into aerial, flower, leaf, root, rosette, seedling, seed, shoot, whole plant, and global (all samples combined) groups. Collectively, the ten networks contained 30% of the measurable genes of Arabidopsis and were circumscribed into 5,491 modules. Modules were scrutinized for cis regulatory mechanisms putatively encoded in conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) previously identified as remnants of a whole genome duplication event. We determined the non-random association of 1,361 unique CNSs to 1,904 co-expression network gene modules. Furthermore, the CNS elements were placed in the context of known gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by connecting 250 CNS motifs with known GRN cis elements. Our results provide support for a regulatory role of some CNS elements and suggest the functional consequences of CNS activation of co-expression in specific gene sets dispersed throughout the genome.

Taylorella equigenitalis is a causative agent of CEM but very little is known about it or its close relative Taylorella asinigenitalis. To reveal novel information about Taylorella biology, comparative genomic analyses were undertaken. Whole genome sequencing was performed for the T. equigenitalis type strain, NCTC11184. Draft genome sequences were produced for a second T. equigenitalis strain and for a strain of T. asinigenitalis. These genome sequences were analysed and compared to each other and the recently released genome sequence of T. equigenitalis MCE9. These analyses revealed that T. equigenitalis strains appear to be very similar to each other with relatively little strain-specific DNA content. A number of genes were identified that encode putative toxins and adhesins that are possibly involved in infection. Analysis of T. asinigenitalis revealed that it has a very similar gene repertoire to that of T. equigenitalis but shares surprisingly little DNA sequence identity with it. The generation of genome sequence information greatly increases knowledge of these poorly characterised bacteria and greatly facilitates study of them. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the use of quantitative phase retrieval methods and their connection to cellular refractive index and dry mass density remain under utilized. This is due in part to the restriction of phase and cellular mass determination to custom built instruments, involved mathematical analysis, and prohibitive sample perturbations. We introduce tomographic bright field imaging, an accessible optical imaging technique enabling the three dimensional measurement of cellular refractive index and dry mass density using a standard transillumination optical microscope. The validity of the technique is demonstrated on polystyrene spheres. The technique is then applied to the measurement of the refractive index, dry mass, volume, and density of red blood cells.

However, relatively low virus titers restrict some of the uses of this system and preparing infectious chimeric reporter viruses have been difficult. In this study, we report cell culture-adapted mutations in wild-type JFH1 yielding higher titers of infectious particles of both JFH1 and chimeric JFH1 viruses carrying reporter genes. Sequencing analyses determined that ten of the sixteen nonsynonymous mutations were in the NS5A region. Individual viruses harboring specific adaptive mutations were prepared and studied. The mutations in the NS5A region, which included all three domains, were most effective in increasing infectious virus production. Insertion of two reporter genes in JFH1 without the adaptive mutations ablated the production of infectious HCV particles. However, the introduction of specific adaptive mutations in the NS5A region permitted reporter genes, Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and EGFP, to be introduced into JHF1 to produce chimeric HCV-NS5A-EGFP and HCV-NS5A-Rluc reporter viruses at relatively high titers of infectious virus. The quantity of hyperphosphorylated NS5A (p58) was decreased in the adapted JFH1 compared wild type JFH1 and is likely be involved in increased production of infectious virus based on previous studies of p58. The JFH1-derived mutant viruses and chimeric reporter viruses described here provide new tools for studying HCV biology, identifying HCV antivirals, and enable new ways of engineering additional infectious chimeric viruses.

In this study, we aimed to identify the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity by using the human kidney proximal tubule cell line HK-2. Furthermore, we investigated the role of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) as a mediator of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity by using wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells and ATF3 knockout (KO) cells. In HK-2 cells, doxorubicin decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and induced an increase in cells in the sub G1 and G2/M phases at all doses. Doxorubicin treatment showed the following dose-dependent effects: increase in the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha; decrease in the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase A and Bcl-2; and increase in the expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and ATF3. Based on these results, we suggest that doxorubicin induces cytotoxicity through an ERK-dependent pathway, and ATF3 plays a pivotal role as a transcriptional regulator in this process.

We employed multiplex 2D gel electrophoresis using Zdyes, a new generation of covalently linked fluorescent differential protein detection dyes to analyze changes in the monocyte proteome in response to Securinine. Securinine antagonism of GABA(A) receptors triggers the activation of p38. We used the differential protein expression results to guide a search of the literature and network analysis software to construct a systems biology model of the effect of Securinine on monocytes. The model suggests that various metabolic modulators (fatty acid binding protein 5, inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and thioredoxin) are at least partially reshaping the metabolic landscape within the monocytes. The actin bundling protein L-plastin, and the Ca2+ binding protein S100A4 also appear to have important roles in the immune response stimulated by Securinine. Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) may be involved in effecting lipid raft composition, inflammation, and hormonal regulation of monocytes, and the model suggests that FABP5 may be a central regulator of metabolism in activated monocytes. The model also suggests that the heat shock proteins have a significant impact on the monocyte immune response.

In the present study, we investigated the in vitro activity of KCN1 on cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution of pancreatic cancer cells, using the MTT and BrdUrd assays, and flow cytometry. The in vivo anti-cancer effects of KCN1 were evaluated in two distinct xenograft models of pancreatic cancer. We also developed an HPLC method for the quantitation of the compound, and examined its stability in mouse plasma, plasma protein binding, and degradation by mouse S9 microsomal enzymes. Furthermore, we examined the pharmacokinetics of KCN1 following intravenous or intraperitoneal injection in mice. Results showed that, in a dose-dependent manner, KCN1 inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, and showed in vivo anticancer efficacy in mice bearing Panc-1 or Mia Paca-2 tumor xenografts. The HPLC method provided linear detection of KCN1 in all of the matrices in the range from 0.1 to 100 mu M, and had a lower limit of detection of 0.085 mu M in mouse plasma. KCN1 was very stable in mouse plasma, extensively plasma bound, and metabolized by S9 microsomal enzymes. The pharmacokinetic studies indicated that KCN1 could be detected in all of the tissues examined, most for at least 24 h.

By developing a mouse anti-bovine IgD heavy chain monoclonal antibody (13C2), we show that secreted bovine IgD was present mainly as a monomer in serum and was heavily glycosylated by N-linked saccharides. Nonetheless, IgD was detectable in some but not all of the Holstein cattle examined. Membrane-bound IgD was detected in the spleen by western blotting. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that IgD-positive B cells constituted a much lower percentage of B cells in the bovine spleen (similar to 6.8% of total B cells), jejunal Peyer's patches (similar to 0.8%), and peripheral blood leukocytes (similar to 1.2%) than in humans and mice. Furthermore, IgD-positive B cells were almost undetectable in bovine bone marrow and ileal Peyer's patches. We also demonstrated that the bovine delta gene can be expressed via class switch recombination. Accordingly, bovine delta germline transcription, which involves an I delta exon and is highly homologous to I mu, was confirmed. However, we could not identify an I delta promoter, despite bovine E mu demonstrating both enhancer and promoter activity.

The 'Approximate Majority' computational algorithm provides the asymptotically fastest way to reach a common decision by all members of a population between two possible outcomes, where the decision approximately matches the initial relative majority. The network that regulates the mitotic entry of the cell-cycle in eukaryotes also makes a decision before it induces early mitotic processes. Here we show that the switch from inactive to active forms of the mitosis promoting Cyclin Dependent Kinases is driven by a system that is related to both the structure and the dynamics of the Approximate Majority computation. We investigate the behavior of these two switches by deterministic, stochastic and probabilistic methods and show that the steady states and temporal dynamics of the two systems are similar and they are exchangeable as components of oscillatory networks.

Accounting for this metabolic lag may be of importance when modeling subsurface transport of contaminants that undergo reactions mediated by microbes. We present a general technique from mathematical biology that can facilitate incorporation of metabolic lags in subsurface solute transport models involving immobile biomass. By making the metabolic activity of bacteria dependent on the local history of substrate concentrations through a convolution integral, the proposed lag formulation is conceptually related to a previously suggested approach. Computer implementation of transport models with the new lag formulation becomes particularly simple when the numerical scheme (at least partly) reduces the original problem to that of solving systems of ordinary differential equations. Example simulation results show that transport models with this lag formulation can be made to fit real experimental data reasonably well by adjusting the lag parameters. The questions of whether parameter estimates can be generalized across individual model applications and/or whether parameters can be determined by independent experiments could be addressed in future research.

Previously, we showed that we could characterize an alpha-helical secondary structure with ESEEM spectroscopy using a H-2-labeled Val side chain coupled with site-directed spin-labeling (SDSL). In order to further develop this new approach, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were conducted on several different hydrophobic residues that are commonly found in membrane proteins. H-2-SL distance distributions from the MD results indicated that H-2-labeled Leu was a very strong candidate to significantly improve this ESEEM approach. In order to test this hypothesis, the secondary structure of the alpha-helical M2 delta peptide of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) incorporated into a bicelle was investigated with H-2-labeled Leu d(10) at position 10 (i) and nitroxide spin labels positioned 1, 2, 3, and 4 residues away (denoted i+1 to i+4) with ESEEM spectroscopy. The ESEEM data reveal a unique pattern that is characteristic of an alpha-helix (3.6 residues per turn). Strong H-2 modulation was detected for the i+3 and i+4 samples, but not for the i+2 sample. The H-2 modulation depth observed for H-2-labeled d(10) Leu was significantly enhanced (X4) when compared to previous ESEEM measurements that used H-2-labeled d(8) Val. Computational studies indicate that deuterium nuclei on the Leu side chain are closer to the spin label when compared to Val. The enhancement of H-2 modulation and the corresponding Fourier Transform (FT) peak intensity for H-2-labeled Leu significantly reduces the ESEEM data acquisition time for Leu when compared to Val. This research demonstrates that a different H-2-labeled amino acid residue can be used as an efficient ESEEM probe further substantiating this important biophysical technique. Finally, this new method can provide pertinent qualitative structural information on membrane proteins in a short time (few minutes) at low sample concentrations (similar to 50 mu M).

NATs have been identified in multiple eukaryotes, including humans, mice, yeast and several plants, and are known to play crucial roles in gene regulation and modification via RNA interference, alternative splicing and genomic imprinting. NATs are also involved in several human diseases.Results: We describe a novel method to detect the occurrence of target NATs in specific plant tissues. This method differs from the others currently used in molecular biology laboratories for a number of reasons, particularly the simplicity and versatility of application, low cost and lower material requirement. We demonstrate that NATs can be detected by using diluted cDNA, avoiding the need for a large amount of RNA, thus differing from basic techniques, such as Northern blot hybridisation and reverse-transcription PCR amplification. Furthermore, our method also allows the precise detection of long NATs and their cloning into plasmid vectors for downstream applications. We also reported the first case of a tissue-specific NAT occurring in Oleaceae family and, the antisense orientation of this transcript, allows the splicing of two introns otherwise impossible in the sense orientation.Conclusions: This method is the first that combines the polymerisation and cleavage activity of DNA polymerase and exonuclease enzymes, respectively, to discover NATs in living organisms. It may simplify the discovery of NATs in plants providing a new strategy for an easy identification and characterization of this group of RNA molecules.

With the initiation of the ""i5k"" project, which aims to sequence 5,000 insect genomes by 2016, many novel insect genomes will soon become publicly available, yet few annotation resources are currently available for insects. Thus, we developed an online tool called the Insect Innate Immunity Database (IIID) to provide an open access resource for insect immunity and comparative biology research (http://www.vanderbilt.edu/IIID). The database provides users with simple exploratory tools to search the immune repertoires of five insect models (including Nasonia), spanning three orders, for specific immunity genes or genes within a particular immunity pathway. As a proof of principle, we used an initial database with only four insect models to annotate potential immune genes in the parasitoid wasp genus Nasonia. Results specify 306 putative immune genes in the genomes of N. vitripennis and its two sister species N. giraulti and N. longicornis. Of these genes, 146 were not found in previous annotations of Nasonia immunity genes. Combining these newly identified immune genes with those in previous annotations, Nasonia possess 489 putative immunity genes, the largest immune repertoire found in insects to date.

One example is the dioecious herb Borderea chouardii (Dioscoreaceae), which is a Tertiary, tropical relict, occurring only on two adjacent vertical cliffs in the world. We studied its reproductive biology, which in some aspects is extreme, especially the unusual double mutualistic role of ants as both pollinators and dispersers. We made a 2-year pollination census and four years of seed-dispersal experiments, recording flower visitors and dispersal rates. Fruit and seed set, self-sowing of seeds, seedling recruitment, and fate of seedlings from seeds sowed by different agents were scored over a period of 17 years. The ants Lasius grandis and L. cinereus were the main pollinators, whereas another ant Pheidole pallidula dispersed seeds. Thus ants functioned as double mutualists. Two thirds of all new seedlings came from self-sown seeds, and 1/3 was dispersed by ants, which gathered the seeds with their oil-rich elaiosome. Gravity played a minor role to dispersal. Both ant dispersal and self-sowing resulted in the same survival rate of seedlings. A double mutualism is a risky reproductive strategy, but B. chouardii buffers that by an unusual long-term demographic stability (some individuals exceed 300 years in lifespan) and its presence in a climatically very stable habitat, inaccessible to large herbivores. Such a combination of traits and habitat properties may explain the persistence of this relict species.

A total of 200 C. coli isolates selected from fecal, environmental, and carcass samples of ABF (n = 100) and conventional (n = 100) swine production systems were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Sequence data from seven housekeeping genes was analyzed for the identification of allelic profiles, sequence types (STs) and clonal complex determination. Phylogenetic trees were generated to establish the relationships between the genotyped isolates. A total of 51 STs were detected including two novel alleles (glnA 424 and glyA 464) and 14 novel STs reported for the first time. The majority of the C. coli isolates belonged to ST-854 (ABF: 31, conventional: 17), and were grouped in clonal complex ST-828 (ABF: 68%, conventional: 66%). The mean genetic diversity (H) for the ABF (0.3963+/-0.0806) and conventional (0.4655+/-0.0714) systems were similar. The index of association (I-A(s)) for the ABF (I-A(s) = 0.1513) and conventional (I-A(s) = 0.0991) C. coli populations were close to linkage equilibrium, indicative of a freely recombining population. Identical STs were detected between the pigs and their environment both at farm and slaughter. A minimum spanning tree revealed the close clustering of C. coli STs that originated from swine and carcass with those from the environment. In conclusion, our study reveals a genotypic diverse C. coli population that shares a common ancestry in the conventional and ABF swine production systems. This could potentially explain the high prevalence of antimicrobial resistant C. coli in the ABF system in the absence of antimicrobial selection pressure.

In addition, a Chinese medicine expert classified each RA patient as a Cold or Heat type according to Chinese medicine theory. Multivariate data analysis techniques are employed to detect and validate biochemical and symptom relationships with the classification.Results: The questionnaire items 'Red joints', 'Swollen joints', 'Warm joints' suggest differences in the level of inflammation between the groups although c-reactive protein (CRP) and rheumatoid factor (RHF) levels were equal. Multivariate analysis of the urine metabolomics data revealed that the levels of 11 acylcarnitines were lower in the Cold RA than in the Heat RA patients, suggesting differences in muscle breakdown. Additionally, higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels in Heat patients compared to Cold patients were found suggesting that the Cold RA group has a more suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function.Conclusion: Significant and relevant biochemical differences are found between Cold and Heat RA patients. Differences in immune function, HPA axis involvement and muscle breakdown point towards opportunities to tailor disease management strategies to each of the subgroups RA patient.

Essential oils, take effects through inhalation or topical application, are believed to enhance physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Although clinical studies suggest that the use of essential oils may have therapeutic potential, evidence for the efficacy of essential oils in treating medical conditions remains poor, with a particular lack of studies employing rigorous analytical methods that capture its identifiable impact on human biology. Here, we report a comprehensive gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) based metabonomics study that reveals the aromas-induced metabolic changes and the anxiolytic effect of aromas in elevated plus maze (EPM) induced anxiety model rats. The significant alteration of metabolites in the EPM group was attenuated by aromas treatment, concurrent with the behavioral improvement with significantly increased open arms time and open arms entries. Brain tissue and urinary metabonomic analysis identified a number of altered metabolites in response to aromas intervention. These metabolic changes included the increased carbohydrates and lowered levels of neurotransmitters (tryptophan, serine, glycine, aspartate, tyrosine, cysteine, phenylalanine, hypotaurine, histidine, and asparagine), amino acids, and fatty acids in the brain. Elevated aspartate, carbohydrates (sucrose, maltose, fructose, and glucose), nucleosides and organic acids such as lactate and pyruvate were also observed in the urine. The EPM induced metabolic differences observed in urine or brain tissue was significantly reduced after 10 days of aroma inhalation, as noted with the loss of statistical significance on many of the metabolites in the aroma-EPM group. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the metabonomics approach can capture the subtle metabolic changes resulting from exposure to essential oils and provide the basis for pinpointing affected pathways in anxiety-related behavior, which will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of anxiolytic effect of essential oils.

The functional diversity of GAPDH from Dunaliella bardawil (DbGAPDH) may relate to the regulatory elements lying in the promoter at the transcriptional level. Using RT-PCR and RACE reactions, gapdh cDNA was isolated, and the full-length genomic sequence was obtained by LA-PCR-based genome walking. The full-length cDNA sequence was 1645 bp containing an 1128 bp putative open reading frame (ORE), which coded a 375 amino acids-deduced polypeptide whose molecular weight was 40.27 kDa computationally. Protein conserved domain search and structural computation found that DbGAPDH consists of two structural conserved domains highly homologous in most species; multiple sequence alignment discovered two positive charge residues (Lys164 and Arg 233), which play a critical role in the protein-protein interaction between GAPDH, phosphoribulokinase (PRK), and CP12. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that DbGAPDH has a closer relationship with analogues from algae and higher plants than with those from other species. In silico analysis of the promoter region revealed six potential regulatory elements might be involved in four hypothesized functions characterized by chloroplast GAPDH: oxygen-, light-, pathogen-, and cold-induced regulation. These results might supply some hints for the functional diversity mechanisms of DbGAPDH, and fresh information for further research to bridge the gap between our knowledge of DNA and protein structure and our understanding of functional biology in GAPDH regulation.

As such, there is a growing need to develop chemical reporters to examine the physiological and pathological roles of protein methyltransferases. Several sterically bulky SAM analogues have previously been used to label substrates of specific protein methyltransferases. However, broad application of these compounds has been limited by their general incompatibility with native enzymes. Here we report a SAM surrogate, ProSeAM (propargylic Se-adenosyl-L-selenomethionine), as a reporter of methyltransferases. ProSeAM can be processed by multiple protein methyltransferases for substrate labeling. In contrast, sulfur-based propargylic SAM undergoes rapid decomposition at physiological pH, likely via an allene intermediate. In conjunction with fluorescent/affinity-based azide probes, copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry, in-gel fluorescence visualization and proteomic analysis, we further demonstrated ProSeAM's utility to profile substrates of endogenous methyltransferases in diverse cellular contexts. These results thus feature ProSeAM as a convenient probe to study the activities of endogenous protein methyltransferases.

The high levels of conformational plasticity of this class of proteins endows them, with unique capacities to act in functional modes not achievable by folded proteins, but also places their molecular characterization beyond the reach of classical structural biology. New techniques are therefore required to understand the relationship between primary sequence and biological function in this class of proteins. Although dependences of some NMR parameters such as chemical shifts (CSs) or residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) on structural propensity are known, so that sampling regimes are often inferred from experimental observation, there is currently no framework that allows for a statistical mapping of the available Ramachandran space of each amino acid in terms of conformational propensity. In this study we develop such an approach, combining highly efficient conformational sampling with ensemble selection to map the backbone conformational sampling of IDPs on a residue specific level. By systematically analyzing the ability of NMR data to map the conformational landscape of disordered proteins, we identify combinations of RDCs and CSs that can be used to raise conformational degeneracies inherent to different data types, and apply these approaches to characterize the conformational behavior of two intrinsically disordered proteins, the K18 domain from Tau protein and N-TAIL from measles virus nucleoprotein.

DLBCL represents a diverse set of lymphomas, defined as diffuse proliferation of large B lymphoid cells. Numerous cytogenetic studies including karyotypes and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), as well as morphological, biological, clinical, microarray and sequencing technologies have attempted to categorize DLBCL into morphological variants, molecular and immunophenotypic subgroups, as well as distinct disease entities. Despite such efforts, most lymphoma remains undistinguishable and falls into DLBCL, not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS). The advent of microarray-based studies (chromosome, RNA, gene expression, etc) has provided a plethora of high-resolution data that could potentially facilitate the finer classification of DLBCL. This review covers the microarray data currently published for DLBCL. We will focus on these types of data; 1) array based CGH; 2) classical CGH; and 3) gene expression profiling studies. The aims of this review were three-fold: (1) to catalog chromosome loci that are present in at least 20% or more of distinct DLBCL subtypes; a detailed list of gains and losses for different subtypes was generated in a table form to illustrate specific chromosome loci affected in selected subtypes; (2) to determine common and distinct copy number alterations among the different subtypes and based on this information, characteristic and similar chromosome loci for the different subtypes were depicted in two separate chromosome ideograms; and, (3) to list re-classified subtypes and those that remained indistinguishable after review of the microarray data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to compile and review available literatures on microarray analysis data and their practical utility in classifying DLBCL subtypes. Although conventional cytogenetic methods such as Karyotypes and FISH have played a major role in classification schemes of lymphomas, better classification models are clearly needed to further understanding the biology, disease outcome and therapeutic management of DLBCL. In summary, microarray data reviewed here can provide better subtype specific classifications models for DLBCL.

Diffraction and NMR studies have revealed structure and dynamics of bound waters at atomic resolution. However, localizing the sites and measuring the dynamics of bound waters, particularly on timescales relevant to catalysis and macromolecular assembly, is quite challenging. Here we demonstrate two techniques: first, temperature-dependent radiolytic hydroxyl radical labeling with a mass spectrometry (MS)-based readout to identify sites of bulk and bound water interactions with surface and internal residue side chains, and second, H-2 O-18 radiolytic exchange coupled MS to measure the millisecond dynamics of bound water interactions with various internal residue side chains. Through an application of the methods to cytochrome c and ubiquitin, we identify sites of water binding and measure the millisecond dynamics of bound waters in protein crevices. As these MS-based techniques are very sensitive and not protein size limited, they promise to provide unique insights into protein-water interactions and water dynamics for both small and large proteins and their complexes.

Lipin-1 is critical for lipid synthesis and homeostasis in adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and peripheral nerves. Little is known about the physiological role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. By using lipin-2-deficient mice, we uncovered a functional relationship between lipin-1 and lipin-2 that operates in a tissue-specific and age-dependent manner. In liver, lipin-2 deficiency led to a compensatory increase in hepatic lipin-1 protein and elevated PAP activity, which maintained lipid homeostasis under basal conditions, but led to diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. As lipin-2-deficient mice aged, they developed ataxia and impaired balance. This was associated with the combination of lipin-2 deficiency and an age-dependent reduction in cerebellar lipin-1 levels, resulting in altered cerebellar phospholipid composition. Similar to patients with Majeed syndrome, lipin-2-deficient mice developed anemia, but did not show evidence of osteomyelitis, suggesting that additional environmental or genetic components contribute to the bone abnormalities observed in patients. Combined lipin-1 and lipin-2 deficiency caused embryonic lethality. Our results reveal functional interactions between members of the lipin family in vivo, and a unique role for lipin-2 in central nervous system biology that may be particularly important with advancing age. Additionally, as has been observed in mice and humans with lipin-1 deficiency, the pathophysiology in lipin-2 deficiency is associated with dysregulation of lipid intermediates.

As a reference, we studied conspecific populations from the well-studied metapopulation in the Aland Islands (AL), 400 km away. A large population in Saaremaa, Estonia, was used as a reference for estimating genetic diversity and N-e. We investigated 58 traits related to behavior, development, morphology, reproductive performance, and metabolism. The PT population exhibited high genetic load (L = 1 - W-PT/W-AL) in a range of fitness-related traits including adult weight (L = 0.12), flight metabolic rate (L = 0.53), egg viability (L = 0.37), and lifetime production of eggs in an outdoor population cage (L = 0.70). These results imply extensive fixation of deleterious recessive mutations, supported by greatly reduced diversity in microsatellite markers and immediate recovery (heterosis) of egg viability and flight metabolic rate in crosses with other populations. There was no significant inbreeding depression in most traits due to one generation of full-sib mating. Resting metabolic rate was significantly elevated in PT males, which may be related to their short lifespan (L = 0.25). The demographic history and the effective size of the PT population place it in the part of the parameter space in which models predict mutation accumulation. This population exemplifies the increasingly common situation in fragmented landscapes, in which small and completely isolated populations are vulnerable to extinction due to high genetic load.

In particular, the various sample preparation methods and bioinformatics tools can be integrated to improve the proteomics platform for applications like target organelle proteomics. We have recently integrated a rapid sample preparation method and bioinformatics classification system for comparative analysis of plant responses to two plant hormones, zeatin and brassinosteroid (BR). These hormones belong to two distinct classes of plant growth regulators, yet both can promote cell elongation and growth. An understanding of the differences and the cross-talk between the two types of hormone responses will allow us to better understand the molecular mechanisms and to identify new candidate genes for plant engineering.Results: As compared to traditional organelle proteomics, the organelle-enrichment method both simplifies the sample preparation and increases the number of proteins identified in the targeted organelle as well as the entire sample. Both zeatin and BR induce dramatic changes in signaling and metabolism. Their shared-regulated protein components indicate that both hormones may down-regulate some key components in auxin responses. However, they have shown distinct induction and suppression of metabolic pathways in mitochondria and chloroplast. For zeatin, the metabolic pathways in sucrose and starch biosynthesis and utilization were significantly changed, yet the lipid biosynthesis remained unchanged. For BR, lipid biosynthesis and beta oxidation were both down-regulated, yet the changes in sucrose and starch metabolism were minor.Conclusions: We present a rapid sample preparation method and bioinformatics classification for effective proteomics analysis of plant hormone responses. The study highlighted the largely differing response to zeatin and brassinosteroid by the metabolic pathways in chloroplast and mitochondria.

Inflammation is a protective response to noxious stimuli that unavoidably occurs at a cost to normal tissue function. This fundamental trade-off between the cost and benefit of the inflammatory response has been optimized over evolutionary time for specific environmental conditions. Rapid change of the human environment due to niche construction outpaces genetic adaptation through natural selection, leading increasingly to a mismatch between the modern environment and selected traits. Consequently, multiple trade-offs that affect human physiology are not optimized to the modern environment, leading to increased disease susceptibility. Here we examine the inflammatory response from an evolutionary perspective. We discuss unique aspects of the inflammatory response and its evolutionary history that can help explain the association between inflammation and modern human diseases.

Melanomas may involve genetic, epigenetic and metabolic abnormalities. Evidence is emerging that epigenetic changes might play a significant role in tumor cell plasticity and metastatic phenotype of melanoma cells.Principal findings: In this study, we developed a systematic approach to identify genes implicated in melanoma progression. To do this, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays to screen 34,000 mouse transcripts in melan-a melanocytes, 4C pre-malignant melanocytes, 4C11- non-metastatic and 4C11+ metastatic melanoma cell lines. The genome-wide association studies revealed pathways commonly over-represented in the transition from immortalized to pre-malignant stage, and under-represented in the transition from non-metastatic to metastatic stage. Additionally, the treatment of cells with 10 mM 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine (5AzaCdR) for 48 hours allowed us to identify genes differentially re-expressed at specific stages of melan-a malignant transformation. Treatment of human primary melanocytes with the demethylating agent 5AzaCdR in combination to the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) revealed changes on melanocyte morphology and gene expression which could be an indicator of epigenetic flexibility in normal melanocytes. Moreover, changes on gene expression recognized by affecting the melanocyte biology (NDRG2 and VDR), phenotype of metastatic melanoma cells (HSPB1 and SERPINE1) and response to cancer therapy (CTCF, NSD1 and SRC) were found when Mel-2 and/or Mel-3-derived patient metastases were exposed to 5AzaCdR plus TSA treatment. Hierarchical clustering and network analyses in a panel of five patient-derived metastatic melanoma cells showed gene interactions that have never been described in melanomas.Significance: Despite the heterogeneity observed in melanomas, this study demonstrates the utility of our murine melanoma progression model to identify molecular markers commonly perturbed in metastasis. Additionally, the novel gene expression signature identified here may be useful in the future into a model more closely related to translational research.

Even though many problems associated with this method have been highlighted and solutions have been proposed, little has been done to increase comparability among studies. We reviewed recent publications applying SDMs and found that seventy nine percent failed to report methods that ensure comparability among studies, such as disclosing the maximum probability range produced by the models and reporting on the number of species occurrences used. We modeled six species of Falco from northern Europe and demonstrate that model results are altered by (1) spatial bias in species' occurrence data, (2) differences in the geographic extent of the environmental data, and (3) the effects of transformation of model output to presence/absence data when applying thresholds. Depending on the modeling decisions, forecasts of the future geographic distribution of Falco ranged from range contraction in 80% of the species to no net loss in any species, with the best model predicting no net loss of habitat in Northern Europe. The fact that predictions of range changes in response to climate change in published studies may be influenced by decisions in the modeling process seriously hampers the possibility of making sound management recommendations. Thus, each of the decisions made in generating SDMs should be reported and evaluated to ensure conclusions and policies are based on the biology and ecology of the species being modeled.

They allow a spatial resolution below the cellular scale and are applied particularly when problems are studied where multiple spatial and temporal scales are involved. Despite the increasing usage of CPMs in theoretical biology, this model class has received little attention from mathematical theory. To narrow this gap, the CPMs are subjected to a theoretical study here. It is asked to which extent the updating rules establish an appropriate dynamical model of intercellular interactions and what the principal behavior at different time scales characterizes. It is shown that the longtime behavior of a CPM is degenerate in the sense that the cells consecutively die out, independent of the specific interdependence structure that characterizes the model. While CPMs are naturally defined on finite, spatially bounded lattices, possible extensions to spatially unbounded systems are explored to assess to which extent spatio-temporal limit procedures can be applied to describe the emergent behavior at the tissue scale. To elucidate the mechanistic structure of CPMs, the model class is integrated into a general multiscale framework. It is shown that the central role of the surface fluctuations, which subsume several cellular and intercellular factors, entails substantial limitations for a CPM's exploitation both as a mechanistic and as a phenomenological model.

The mechanism underlying metabolic network modularity is of great interest not only to researchers of basic science but also to those in fields of engineering. Previous studies have suggested a theoretical model, which proposes that a change in the evolutionary goal (system-specific purpose) increases network modularity, and this hypothesis was supported by statistical data analysis. Nevertheless, further investigation has uncovered additional possibilities that might explain the origin of network modularity. In this work we propose an evolving network model without tuning parameters to describe metabolic networks. We demonstrate, quantitatively, that metabolic network modularity can arise from simple growth processes, independent of the change in the evolutionary goal. Our model is applicable to a wide range of organisms and appears to suggest that metabolic network modularity can be more simply determined than previously thought. Nonetheless, our proposition does not serve to contradict the previous model; it strives to provide an insight from a different angle in the ongoing efforts to understand metabolic evolution, with the hope of eventually achieving the synthetic engineering of metabolic networks.

There is ongoing debate regarding the typical directionality of transitions between aquatic and terrestrial habitats and the mechanisms responsible for the preponderance of terrestrial to aquatic transitions. Snail-killing flies (Diptera: Sciomyzidae) represent an excellent model system to study such transitions because their larvae display a range of feeding behaviors, being predators, parasitoids or saprophages of a variety of mollusks in freshwater, shoreline and dry terrestrial habitats. The remarkable genus Tetanocera (Tetanocerini) occupies five larval feeding groups and all of the habitat types mentioned above. This study has four principal objectives: (i) construct a robust estimate of phylogeny for Tetanocera and Tetanocerini, (ii) estimate the evolutionary transitions in larval feeding behaviors and habitats, (iii) test the monophyly of feeding groups and (iv) identify mechanisms underlying sciomyzid habitat and feeding behavior evolution.Results: Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of molecular data provided strong support that the Sciomyzini, Tetanocerini and Tetanocera are monophyletic. However, the monophyly of many behavioral groupings was rejected via phylogenetic constraint analyses. We determined that (i) the ancestral sciomyzid lineage was terrestrial, (ii) there was a single terrestrial to aquatic habitat transition early in the evolution of the Tetanocerini and (iii) there were at least 10 independent aquatic to terrestrial habitat transitions and at least 15 feeding behavior transitions during tetanocerine phylogenesis. The ancestor of Tetanocera was aquatic with five lineages making independent transitions to terrestrial habitats and seven making independent transitions in feeding behaviors.Conclusions: The preponderance of aquatic to terrestrial transitions in sciomyzids goes against the trend generally observed across eukaryotes. Damp shoreline habitats are likely transitional where larvae can change habitat but still have similar prey available. Transitioning from aquatic to terrestrial habitats is likely easier than the reverse for sciomyzids because morphological characters associated with air-breathing while under the water's surface are lost rather than gained, and sciomyzids originated and diversified during a general drying period in Earth's history. Our results imply that any animal lineage having aquatic and terrestrial members, respiring the same way in both habitats and having the same type of food available in both habitats could show a similar pattern of multiple independent habitat transitions coincident with changes in behavioral and morphological traits.

For 172 patients treated without trastuzumab, the hazard ratio for RFS of pCR versus no pCR was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.82). pCR was more predictive of RFS by multivariate analysis when subtype was taken into account, and point estimates of hazard ratios within the HR-positive/HER2-negative (hazard ratio, 0.00; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.93), HR-negative/HER2-negative (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.97), and HER2-positive (hazard ratio, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01 to 1.0) subtypes are lower. Ki67 further improved the prediction of pCR within subsets.ConclusionIn this biologically high-risk group, pCR differs by receptor subset. pCR is more highly predictive of RFS within every established receptor subset than overall, demonstrating that the extent of outcome advantage conferred by pCR is specific to tumor biology.

Firefly luciferase, catalyzes the bioluminescence reaction and is an excellent tool as a reporter in nano-system biology studies. Nonetheless, the enzyme rapidly loses its activity at temperatures above 30 degrees C and this leads to reduced sensitivity and precision in analytical applications. Residue Thr346 in a connecting loop (341-348) of firefly luciferase is located in a disallowed region of Ramachandran plot. In this study, we have substituted this residue (T346) with anomalous dihedral angles with Val, Gly and Pro to clarify the role of this residue in structure and function of the enzyme using site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of this unfavorable residue (T346) with atypical dihedral angles (psi, phi) with other residues brought about an increase of thermostability and decrease of specific activity. Structural and functional properties of the mutants were analyzed using different spectroscopic methods. It seems that this residue is a critically conserved residue to support the functional flexibility for a fast kinetic bioluminescence reaction at the expense of lower stability.

This species presents a direct development with brooding in the parental tube and specimens with gametes inside the coelom and female tubes with eggs and/or larvae were observed in every sampling month. This suggested that the species reproduces during the whole year, with the main reproductive period from April to September. The male:female sex ratio ranged from 1:2 to 1:4, with females always dominating the population. A comparison with other Diopatra Audouin and Milne Edwards, 1833 (Onuphidae) showed that D. marocensis is the largest species with direct development and with the highest number of eggs and larvae inside the parental tube. With the exception of the colour, due to the presence of the gametes in the coelom cavity, no morphological differences between males and females were observed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

NET). Lately, increasingly more Java applications have long (or very long) execution times and manipulate large amounts of data/information, gaining relevance in fields related with e-Science (with Grid and Cloud computing). Significant examples include Chemistry, Computational Biology and Bio-informatics, with many available Java-based APIs (e. g., Neobio).Often, when the execution of such an application is terminated abruptly because of a failure (regardless of the cause being a hardware of software fault, lack of available resources, etc.), all of its work already performed is simply lost, and when the application is later re-initiated, it has to restart all its work from scratch, wasting resources and time, while also being prone to another failure and may delay its completion with no deadline guarantees.Our proposed solution to address these issues is through incorporating mechanisms for checkpointing and migration in a JVM. These make applications more robust and flexible by being able to move to other nodes, without any intervention from the programmer. This article provides a solution to Java applications with long execution times, by extending a JVM (Jikes research virtual machine) with such mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Frequently, transcription is driven by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to specific DNA sequences. These motifs are usually short and degenerate, rendering the likelihood of multiple copies occurring throughout the genome due to random chance as high. Despite this, TFs only bind to a small subset of sites, thus prompting our investigation into the differences between motifs that are bound by TFs and those that remain unbound. Here we constructed vectors representing various chromatin- and sequence-based features for a published set of bound and unbound motifs representing nine TFs in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a machine learning approach, we identified a set of features that can be used to discriminate between bound and unbound motifs. We also discovered that some TFs bind most or all of their strong motifs in intergenic regions. Our data demonstrate that local sequence context can be strikingly different around motifs that are bound compared to motifs that are unbound. We concluded that there are multiple combinations of genomic features that characterize bound or unbound motifs. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The understanding of the genetic organization and molecular biology of tea plant, which is very poorly understood at present, is required for quantum increase in productivity and efficient use of germplasm for either cultivation or breeding program. Single-pass sequencing of randomly selected cDNA clones is the most widely accepted technique for gene identification and cloning. In the present study, a good quality cDNA library was constructed and preliminary analysis of ESTs was carried out. The titers of unamplified and amplified libraries were 1.4x10(6)pfu/ml and 5.27x10(8)pfu/ml respectively. A total of 210 cDNA clones from the constructed cDNA library were sequenced and analyzed. A total of 84 high quality Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were generated, among which 71 ESTs had significant homology with sequences in NCBI non-redundant protein database by BLAST X analysis. About 80% ESTs had poly (A) tail at 3' end indicating that the cDNAs were full length. The database-matched ESTs were classified into putative cellular roles, viz. energy-related category (corresponding to 20% of total BLAST X matched ESTs), Transcription (14.2%), protein synthesis (14.2%) cell growth and division (8.6%), cell structure (5.7%), signal transduction (5.7%), transporters (2.9%), disease and defenses (2.9%), secondary metabolism (2.9%) and gene regulation (2.9%).

In this paper, we employ a stochastic search implementation of the Torquato-Jiao adaptive-shrinking-cell (ASC) optimization scheme [Nature (London) 460, 876 (2009)] to find maximally dense particle packings in d-dimensional Euclidean space R-d. While the original implementation was designed to study spheres and convex polyhedra in d >= 3, our implementation focuses on d = 2 and extends the algorithm to include both concave polygons and certain complex convex or concave nonpolygonal particle shapes. We verify the robustness of this packing protocol by successfully reproducing the known putative optimal packings of congruent copies of regular pentagons and octagons, then employ it to suggest dense packing arrangements of congruent copies of certain families of concave crosses, convex and concave curved triangles (incorporating shapes resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo), and ""moonlike"" shapes. Analytical constructions are determined subsequently to obtain the densest known packings of these particle shapes. For the examples considered, we find that the densest packings of both convex and concave particles with central symmetry are achieved by their corresponding optimal Bravais lattice packings; for particles lacking central symmetry, the densest packings obtained are nonlattice periodic packings, which are consistent with recently-proposed general organizing principles for hard particles. Moreover, we find that the densest known packings of certain curved triangles are periodic with a four-particle basis, and we find that the densest known periodic packings of certain moonlike shapes possess no inherent symmetries. Our work adds to the growing evidence that particle shape can be used as a tuning parameter to achieve a diversity of packing structures.

To evaluate the duration of persistent efficacy against nasal bots (Oestrus ovis), a natural exposure study was conducted in Spain during the summer of 2011. One hundred and twenty nasal bot-free, Rasa Aragonesa sheep were randomly allocated to eight groups of 15 animals each. On Day 0, four groups were treated at the recommended dose rate of 1 mg moxidectin/kg bodyweight. Four groups remained untreated as negative controls. All animals were held in nasal bot-proof housing except for exposure to natural challenge when one group of treated sheep and one of group of control animals were transferred to a local pasture at either 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, or 60-80 days after treatment. Following challenge, sheep were scored for clinical signs of bot infestation, necropsied and the heads sectioned for larval recovery. Nasal bot larvae were retrieved from 7 to 11 control sheep following each exposure period indicating that adult bots were active throughout the study. In the first challenge up to 20 days after treatment, when sheep were slaughtered immediately after exposure, the majority of larvae were first instar (L1) and only 3 of the 15 control sheep were infested with second instars (L2). There was 100% efficacy against L2 and 38.1% reduction in the number of live L1 in the treated sheep but mean counts were not significantly different between treatment and control groups (P >= 0.05). For the subsequent exposure periods 20-80 days after treatment (necropsies 7-9 days after challenge), 6-10 sheep were infested with L1 and 9-11 control sheep were infested with L2 and third instars (13). There was negligible efficacy against L1, but treatment with moxidectin resulted in 100% control of L2 and L3. These results are consistent with the biology of nasal bots and control with a systemic agent, as the slower growing L1 have limited feeding and are therefore less susceptible to systemic parasiticides. The study demonstrated that the persistent efficacy of this long-acting injectable formulation of moxidectin protects against the development of active O. ovis infestations for at least 80 days after treatment.

The infection alters the RANK/RANKL/OPG signalling dynamics that regulates osteoblasts and osteoclasts behaviour in bone remodelling, i.e. the resorption and mineralization activity. The infection rapidly leads to severe bone loss, necrosis of the affected portion, and it may even spread to other parts of the body. On the other hand, osteoporosis is not a bacterial infection but similarly is a defective bone pathology arising due to imbalances in the RANK/RANKL/OPG molecular pathway, and due to the progressive weakening of bone structure.Results: Since both osteoporosis and osteomyelitis cause loss of bone mass, we focused on comparing the dynamics of these diseases by means of computational models. Firstly, we performed meta-analysis on a gene expression data of normal, osteoporotic and osteomyelitis bone conditions. We mainly focused on RANKL/OPG signalling, the TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies and the NF-kB pathway. Using information from the gene expression data we estimated parameters for a novel model of osteoporosis and of osteomyelitis. Our models could be seen as a hybrid ODE and probabilistic verification modelling framework which aims at investigating the dynamics of the effects of the infection in bone remodelling. Finally we discuss different diagnostic estimators defined by formal verification techniques, in order to assess different bone pathologies (osteopenia, osteoporosis and osteomyelitis) in an effective way.Conclusions: We present a modeling framework able to reproduce aspects of the different bone remodeling defective dynamics of osteomyelitis and osteoporosis. We report that the verification-based estimators are meaningful in the light of a feed forward between computational medicine and clinical bioinformatics.

While it was previously believed that the small bacterial cell size and fast diffusion in the cytoplasm effectively remove any such gradient, a new computational study published in BMC Biophysics supports the emerging view that gradients can exist. The study arose from the recent observation that phosphorylated CtrA forms a gradient prior to cell division in Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium known for its complicated cell cycle. Tropini et al. (2012) postulate that such gradients can provide an internal chemical compass, directing protein localization, cell division and cell development. More specifically, they describe biochemical and physical constraints on the formation of such gradients and explore a number of existing bacterial cell morphologies. These chemical gradients may limit in vitro analyses, and may ensure timing control and robustness to fluctuations during critical stages in cell development.

The device is based on single-electron counting techniques by means of a gas detector; it simulates a 'nanometre-sized' biological volume of about 20 nm in diameter that can be moved with respect to a narrow particle beam to measure the ionization-cluster-size distributions caused within the target volume by the passage of single primary particles, as a function of the impact parameter. To investigate the ionization-cluster-size formation caused by primary particles of medical interest when they penetrate through or pass by the target volume at a specified impact parameter, measurements and Monte Carlo simulations were performed for 20 MeV protons, 16 MeV deuterons, 48 MeV Li-6-ions, 26.7 MeV Li-7-ions and 96 MeV C-12-ions. The detailed analysis of the resulting distributions showed that in the track-core region their shape is mainly determined by the mean free ionization path length of the primary particles, whereas in the penumbra region the shape of the distributions is almost independent of the impact parameter, and also of the particle type and velocity.

However, the functional significance of genome-wide hypermethylation and hypomethylation of gene promoters in carcinogenesis currently remain unclear.Principal Findings: Based on genome-wide methylation data for five cancer types, we showed that genes with promoter hypermethylation were highly consistent in function across different cancer types, and so were genes with promoter hypomethylation. Functions related to ""developmental processes"" and ""regulation of biology processes"" were significantly enriched with hypermethylated genes but were depleted of hypomethylated genes. In contrast, functions related to ""cell killing"" and ""response to stimulus"", including immune and inflammatory response, were associated with an enrichment of hypomethylated genes and depletion of hypermethylated genes. We also observed that some families of cytokines secreted by immune cells, such as IL10 family cytokines and chemokines, tended to be hypomethylated in various cancer types. These results provide new hints for understanding the distinct functional roles of genome-wide hypermethylation and hypomethylation of gene promoters in carcinogenesis.Conclusions: Genes with promoter hypermethylation and hypomethylation are highly consistent in function across different cancer types, respectively, but these two groups of genes tend to be enriched in different functions associated with cancer. Especially, we speculate that hypomethylation of gene promoters may play roles in inducing immunity and inflammation disorders in precancerous conditions, which may provide hints for improving epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy of cancer.

Here, we consider scaling of xenarthrans, particularly how femoral form and function varies to accommodate the size range between the 3 kg armadillo and its giant relative the 300 kg glyptodont. It has already been noted that femoral morphology differs between these animals and suggested that this reflects a novel adaptation to size increase in glyptodont. We test this idea by applying a finite element analysis of coronal plane forces to femoral models of these animals, simulating the stance phase in the hind limb; where the femur is subject to bending owing to longitudinal compressive as well as abduction loads on the greater trochanter. We use these models to examine the hypothesis that muscles attaching on the third trochanter (T3) can reduce this bending in the loaded femur and that the T3 forces are more effective at reducing bending in glyptodont where the T3 is situated at the level of the knee. The analysis uses traditional finite element methods to produce strain maps and examine strains at 200 points on the femur. The coordinates of these points before and after loading are also used to carry out geometric morphometric (GM) analyses of the gross deformation of the model in different loading scenarios. The results show that longitudinal compressive and abductor muscle loading increases bending in the coronal plane, and that loads applied to the T3 reduce that bending. In the glyptodont model, the T3 loads are more effective and can more readily compensate for the bending owing to longitudinal and abductor loads. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of GM methods in interpreting the results of finite element analyses.

Recently, these relationships have been incorporated into the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) that links the ecology of populations, communities and ecosystems to the MR of individual organisms. The fundamental equation of MTE derives the relation between mass and MR using first principles and predicts the temperature dependence of MR based on biochemical kinetics. It is a deliberately simple, zeroth-order approximation that represents a baseline against which variation in real biological systems can be examined. In the present study, we evaluate the fundamental equation of MTE against other more parameter-rich models for MR using an information-theoretic approach to penalize the inclusion of additional parameters. Using a comparative database of MR measurements for 1359 species, from 11 groups ranging from prokaryotes to mammals, and spanning 16 orders of magnitude in mass and a 59 degrees C range in body temperature, we show that differences between taxa in the mass and temperature dependence of MR are sufficiently large as to be retained in the best model for MR despite the requirement for estimation of 22 more parameters than the fundamental equation of MTE.

We submit, therefore, that clinically reliable modelling of the enlargement and overall rupture-potential of aneurysms may require both a better understanding of the mechanobiological processes that govern the evolution of these lesions and new methods of determining the patient-specific state of the pre-aneurysmal aorta ( or correlation to currently unaffected portions thereof) through knowledge of demographics, comorbidities, lifestyle, genetics and future non-invasive or minimally invasive tests.

We developed movement models based on observed avoidance responses of common eider Somateria mollissima to wind farms to predict, and identify potential measures to reduce, impacts. Flight trajectory data that were collected post-construction of the Danish Nysted offshore wind farm were used to parameterize competing models of bird movements around turbines. The model most closely fitting the observed data incorporated individual variation in the minimum distance at which birds responded to the turbines. We show how such models can contribute to the spatial planning of wind farms by assessing their extent, turbine spacing and configurations on the probability of birds passing between the turbines. Avian movement models can make new contributions to environmental assessments of wind farm developments, and provide insights into how to reduce impacts that can be identified at the planning stage.

Molecular regulatory networks through to circulatory systems, nervous systems, social systems and ecological trophic networks show self-similar connectivity at multiple scales. We analyse the relationship between topology and signalling in contrasting classes of such topologies. We find that networks differ in their ability to contain or propagate signals between arbitrary nodes in a network depending on whether they possess branching or loop-like features. Networks also differ in how they respond to noise, such that one allows for greater integration at high noise, and this performance is reversed at low noise. Surprisingly, small-world topologies, with diameters logarithmic in system size, have slower dynamical time scales, and may be less integrated (more modular) than networks with longer path lengths. All of these phenomena are essentially mesoscopic, vanishing in the infinite limit but producing strong effects at sizes and time scales relevant to biology.

These have been called 'kinetic heterogeneity models' so as to distinguish them from 'temporal heterogeneity models', in which a cell population may have different turnover rates at different times, e.g. when resting versus when activated. We model labelling curves for temporally heterogeneous populations, and predict that they exhibit equal biphasic up-and downslopes. We show when cells divide only once upon activation, these slopes are dominated by the slowest exponent, yielding underestimates of the average turnover rate. When cells undergo more than one division, the labelling curves allow fitting of the two exponential slopes in the temporal heterogeneity model. The same data can also be described with a two-compartment kinetic heterogeneity model. In both instances, the average turnover rate is correctly estimated. Because both models assume a different cell biology but describe the data equally well, the parameters of either model have no simple biological interpretation, as each parameter could reflect a combination of parameters of another biological process. Thus, even if there are sufficient data to reliably estimate all exponentials, one can only accurately estimate an average turnover rate. We illustrate these issues by re-fitting labelling data from healthy and HIV-infected individuals.

Here, we develop an approach based on Boolean logic that dramatically reduces the parametrization, making the state and parameter spaces finite and tractable. We introduce efficient methods for fitting Boolean models to molecular data, successfully demonstrating their application to synthetic time courses generated by a number of established clock models, as well as experimental expression levels measured using luciferase imaging. Our results indicate that despite their relative simplicity, logic models can (i) simulate circadian oscillations with the correct, experimentally observed phase relationships among genes and (ii) flexibly entrain to light stimuli, reproducing the complex responses to variations in day-length generated by more detailed differential equation formulations. Our work also demonstrates that logic models have sufficient predictive power to identify optimal regulatory structures from experimental data. By presenting the first Boolean models of circadian circuits together with general techniques for their optimization, we hope to establish a new framework for the systematic modelling of more complex clocks, as well as other circuits with different qualitative dynamics. In particular, we anticipate that the ability of logic models to provide a computationally efficient representation of system behaviour could greatly facilitate the reverse-engineering of large-scale biochemical networks.

To put gene expression into its proper biological context, it is necessary to distinguish differential gene transcription from artificial gene expression induced by changes in the cellular demographics.Results: CTen (cell type enrichment) is a web-based analytical tool which uses our highly expressed, cell specific (HECS) gene database to identify enriched cell types in heterogeneous microarray data. The web interface is designed for differential expression and gene clustering studies, and the enrichment results are presented as heatmaps or downloadable text files.Conclusions: In this work, we use an independent, cell-specific gene expression data set to assess CTen's performance in accurately identifying the appropriate cell type and provide insight into the suggested level of enrichment to optimally minimize the number of false discoveries. We show that CTen, when applied to microarray data developed from infected lung tissue, can correctly identify the cell signatures of key lymphocytes in a highly heterogeneous environment and compare its performance to another popular bioinformatics tool. Furthermore, we discuss the strong implications cell type enrichment has in the design of effective microarray workflow strategies and show that, by combining CTen with gene expression clustering, we may be able to determine the relative changes in the number of key cell types.

Recently, several new families of bioactive lipids were identified that form through the enzymatic oxidation of membrane phospholipids in circulating innate immune cells and platelets. These comprise eicosanoids attached to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine and form within 2-5 minutes of cell activation by pathophysiologic agonists, via the coordinated action of receptors and enzymes. In this review, we summarize what is currently known regarding their structures, mechanisms of formation, cell biology, and signaling actions. We show that phospholipid oxidation by acutely activated immune cells is a controlled event, and we propose a central role in regulating membrane biology and innate immune function during health and disease. We also review the mass spectrometry methods used for identification of the lipids and describe how these approaches can be used for discovery of new lipid mediators in complex biologic samples.

Their role in human conventional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is unknown. Here, we analyzed the post-HSCT recovery of iNKT cells in 71 adult allografted patients. Results were compared with conventional T- and NK-cell recovery and correlated to the occurrence of GVHD, relapse, and survival. We observed that posttransplantation iNKT cells, likely of donor origin, recovered independently of T and NK cells in the first 90 days after HSCT and reached greater levels in recipient younger than 45 years (P = .003) and after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (P = .03). Low posttransplantation iNKT/T ratios (ie, < 10(-3)) were an independent factor associated with the occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD; P = .001). Inversely, reaching iNKT/T ratios > 10(-3) before day 90 was associated with reduced nonrelapse mortality (P = .009) without increased risk of relapse and appeared as an independent predictive factor of an improved overall survival (P = .028). Furthermore, an iNKT/T ratio on day 15 > 0.58 x 10(-3) was associated with a 94% risk reduction of aGVHD. These findings provide a proof of concept that early postallogeneic HSCT iNKT cell recovery can predict the occurrence of aGVHD and an improved overall survival.

To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.

In this study, we performed a case-control study to demonstrate whether the risk for the development of onset of sporadic PD might be influenced by VDR gene polymorphisms in a Chinese cohort. Two hundred and sixty PD patients and 282 matched-healthy controls were genotyped for two representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VDR gene (FokI C/T and BsmI G/A) by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis in. Results from our study revealed that FokI C allele carriers were likely to associate with an increased risk of PD (P = 0.004) as well as early-onset PD (EOPD) (P = 0.010). Moreover, the frequency of FokI C allele was significantly increased in PD group and late-onset PD (LOPD) group relative to the control groups respectively (P = 0.023 and P = 0.033. respectively). For BsmI polymorphisms, no significant difference in genotype or allele distribution was found between PD patients and the controls, as well as gender- and age-related differences between PD patients and the controls subgroup. This study demonstrated a possible association between the VDR FokI T/C polymorphism and PD, indicating that VDR polymorphisms may well change genetic susceptibility to sporadic PD in a Han Chinese population.

Recently, a few trials of anorectal transplantation in animals have been published; however, further development of this technique is required. Moreover, it is crucial to perform this research in dogs, which resemble humans in anorectal anatomy and biology. We designed a canine anorectal transplantation model, wherein anorectal autotransplantation was performed by anastomoses of the rectum, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and vein, and pudendal nerves. Resting pressure in the anal canal and anal canal pressure fluctuation were measured before and after surgery. Graft pathology was examined three days after surgery. The anal blood supply was compared with that in three beagles using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography. The anorectal graft had sufficient arterial blood supply from the IMA; however, the graft's distal end was congested and necrotized. Functional examination demonstrated reduced resting pressure and the appearance of an irregular anal canal pressure wave after surgery. ICG angiography showed that the pudendal arteries provided more blood flow than the IMA to the anal segment. This is the first canine model of preliminary anorectal autotransplantation, and it demonstrates the possibility of establishing a transplantation model in dogs using appropriate vascular anastomoses, thus contributing to the progress of anorectal transplantation.

The hormone kinetics and downstream effects on reproductive organs associated with perturbing androgen regulation are complex and not necessarily intuitive. Inhibition of 5aR decreases the metabolism of testosterone (T) to the potent androgen 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This results in decreased cell proliferation, fluid production and 5aR expression as well as increased apoptosis in the ventral prostate. These regulatory changes collectively result in decreased prostate size and function, which can be beneficial to men suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and could play a role in prostate cancer. There are two distinct isoforms of 5aR in male humans and rats, and thus developing a 5aR inhibitor is a challenging pursuit. Several inhibitors are on the market for treatment of BPH, including finasteride and dutasteride. In this effort, comparisons of simulated vs. experimental T and DHT levels and prostate size are depicted, demonstrating the model accurately described an approximate 77% decrease in prostate size and nearly complete depletion of prostatic DHT following 21 days of daily finasteride dosing in rats. This implies T alone is not capable of maintaining a normal prostate size. Further model analysis suggests the possibility of alternative dosing strategies resulting in similar or greater effects on prostate size, due to complex kinetics between T, DHT and gene occupancy. With appropriate scaling and parameterization for humans, this model provides a multiscale modeling platform for drug discovery teams to test and generate hypotheses about drugging strategies for indications like BPH and prostate cancer, such as compound binding properties, dosing regimens, and target validation.

Surprisingly, we found that a majority of obese BBS patients retained normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.

In vitro studies on human primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) showed that BBS12 inactivation facilitated adipogenesis, increased insulin sensitivity, and glucose utilization. We generated a Bbs12(-/-) mouse model to assess the impact of Bbs12 inactivation on adipocyte biology. Despite increased obesity, glucose tolerance was increased with specific enhanced insulin sensitivity in the fat.

They occur frequently in biology and are believed to be intermediates in formation of gallstones. The pathway by which amphiphiles transform from an initial state of vesicles or micelles into such tubules has puzzled soft matter physicists, and it has raised important questions about the interplay between molecular chirality and self-assembly. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate direct, real-time observations by light microscopy of the pathway to helical microtubules from an initial solution of nanoscale vesicles. The tubules are formed in aqueous mixtures of the single-tailed diacetylenic surfactant, 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA), and a short-chain alcohol. The stepwise process involves nucleation of thin helical microribbons vesicle solution. These ribbons then thicken, rearrange, and fold into closed tubules. Subsequently, most tubules further rearrange into plate-like structures, and once again, we are able to visualize this process in real time. A notable aspect of the above system is that the precursors are achiral; yet, the tubules are formed from helical ribbons. Our study provides new insights into tubule formation that will be valuable in clarifying and refining theoretical models for these fascinating structures.

DEREG mice express a DTR-eGFP fusion protein under the control of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-encoded Foxp3 promoter, allowing the viable isolation and inducible depletion of Foxp3(+) Tregs. Adaptive Tregs differentiated in vitro to express Foxp3 (iTregs) are gaining high interest as potential therapeutics for inflammatory conditions such as autoimmunity, allergy and transplant rejection. However, selective isolation of Foxp3(+) iTregs with a stable phenotype still remains to be a problem, especially in the human setting. While screening for culture conditions to generate stable CD4(+) Foxp3(+) iTregs from DEREG mice, with maximum suppressive activity, we observed an unexpected dichotomy of eGFP and Foxp3 expression which is not seen in ex vivo isolated cells from DEREG mice. Further characterization of eGFP(+) Foxp3(-) cells revealed relatively lower CD25 expression and a lack of suppressive activity in vitro. Similarly, eGFP(-) cells isolated from the same cultures were not suppressive despite of a broad CD25 expression reflecting mere T cell activation. In contrast, eGFP(+) Foxp3(+) iTregs exhibited potent suppressive activity comparable to that of natural eGFP(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs, emphasizing the importance of isolating Foxp3 expressing iTregs. Interestingly, the use of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 or Flt3L-driven BMDC resulted in considerable resolution of the observed dichotomy. In summary, we defined culture conditions for efficient generation of eGFP(+) Foxp3(+) iTregs by use of DEREG mice. Isolation of functional Foxp3(+) iTregs using DEREG mice can also be achieved under sub-optimal conditions based on the magnitude of surface CD25 expression, in synergy with transgene encoded eGFP. Besides, the reported phenomenon may be of general interest for exploring Foxp3 gene regulation, given that Foxp3 and eGFP expression are driven from distinct Foxp3 loci and because this dichotomy preferentially occurs only under defined in vitro conditions.

The ability of SPARC to modulate neovascularisation is believed to be mediated in part by its ability to modulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of SPARC expression in gastric cancer cells on proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.Method: We evaluated expression of SPARC in seven human gastric cancer cell lines. Then we established a stably transfected SPARC overexpressed cell line (BGC-SP) and a stably transfected SPARC knock-down cell line (HGC-sh). The effect of SPARC overexpression and SPARC silencing was studied by examining capillary formation of HUVECs in vitro and a dorsal skin-fold chamber model in vivo. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to detect if the expressions of VEGF and MMP-7 were modulated by SPARC expression. To further determine the effect of SPARC expression on angiogenesis in vivo, xenograft models were established and microvessel density (MVD) of different clones were detected by immunohistochemistry.Results: Endogenous SPARC overexpression inhibited the expression of VEGF and MMP-7, as well as the angiogenesis induced by BGC-SP cells. Correspondingly, SPARC silencing increased the expression of VEGF and MMP-7, as well as the angiogenesis induced by HGC-sh cells. Elevated angiogenesis induced by SPARC silencing in HGC-sh cells was decreased when VEGF was neutralised by antibodies, and MMP-7 was knocked down in vitro.Conclusion: SPARC suppresses angiogenesis of gastric cancer by down-regulating the expression of VEGF and MMP-7.

We find that MDFF can be extended to understand conformational changes in lower-resolution maps if larger structural restraints and lower steering forces are used to prevent overfitting. We further show that the capabilities of MDFF can be extended by combining it with an enhanced conformational sampling method, temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD). Specifically, either TAMD can be used to generate better starting configurations for MDFF fitting or TAMD-assisted MDFF (TAMDFF) can be performed to accelerate conformational search in atomistic simulations.

We investigate the voltage and lateral pressure dependence of their capacitance close to their chain melting transition. Because the gel and the fluid membrane have different area and thickness, the capacitance of the two membrane phases is different. In the presence of external fields, charges exert forces that can influence the state of the membrane, thereby influencing the transition temperature. This phenomenon is called ""electrostriction"". We show that this effect allows us to introduce a capacitive susceptibility that assumes a maximum in the melting transition with an associated excess charge. As a consequence, voltage regimes exist in which a small change in voltage can lead to a large uptake of charge and a large capacitive current.

A single enzymatic reaction with slow conformational changes can filter upstream network noises, and can either resonantly respond to the system stimulus at certain frequencies or respond adaptively for sustained input signals of the network fluctuations. It thus can serve as a basic functional motif with properties that are normally for larger intermolecular networks in the field of systems biology.

The study also suggests that hysteretic enzymes may be building blocks of synthetic networks with various properties such as narrow-banded filtering. The work fills the missing gap between studies on enzyme biophysics and network level dynamics, and reveals that the coupling between the two is functionally important; it also suggests that the conformational dynamics of some enzymes may be evolutionally selected.

Mast cells release an impressive array of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory mediators after activation induced by either immunoglobulin-E (IgE)-dependent or IgE-independent mechanisms. Proliferation, differentiation, survival and activation of mast cells are regulated by stem cell factor (SCF), the ligand for the c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor which is expressed on the mast cell surface. Inappropriate c-kit activation causes accumulation of mast cells in tissues resulting in mastocytosis. A number of activating mutations in c-kit have recently been identified and these mutations results in aberrant mast cell growth. Thus, c-kit inhibitors may have potential application in multiple conditions associated with mast cell disorders including systemic mastocytosis, anaphylaxis, and asthma.

We measured POPs in eggs and plasma of an apex predator, the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) breeding in IS mountainous watersheds across a broad latitudinal, longitudinal and altitudinal range in western Canada. After accounting for proximate biotic factors such as trophic level (delta N-15) and carbon source (delta C-13), variability in contaminant concentrations, including Sigma DDT (sum of trichlorodiphenylethane-related compounds), toxaphene, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), total chlordane, and Sigma PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in osprey tissues was explained by interactions among relative size of watersheds, water bodies, elevation, and glacial input. Sigma DDT in nestling plasma, for example, decreased with lake elevation, probably as a result of local past inputs from agricultural or public health usage at lower altitude sites. In contrast, toxaphene, never used as an insecticide in western Canada, increased with elevation and year-round snow and ice cover in both plasma and eggs, indicating long-range atmospheric sources as dominant for toxaphene. Lower chlorinated PCBs in plasma tended to decrease with elevation and ice cover consistent with published data and model outcomes. Temporal trends of POPs in osprey eggs are coincident with some modeled predictions of release from melting glaciers due to climate change.

Leaves growing below 2 m from the forest floor exhibit delta C-13 values that are, on average, 1.1% lower than those growing above this threshold. We did not, however, find any relationship between foliar delta C-13 and distance from the edge. Unpredictably, we detected a striking positive relationship between foliar delta N-15 values and increasing distance into the forest interior. Variability in physiology among species, anthropogenic influence, organic input, and rooting depth cannot adequately explain this trend. Instead, this unexpected relationship most likely reflects decreasing nutrient or water availability, or a shift in N-sources with increasing distance from the savannah. Unlike most forest communities, the trees at Ampijoroa are growing in nutrient-limited sands. In addition to being nutrient poor, these well-drained soils likely decrease the amount of soil water available to forest vegetation. Continued research on plant responses to edge effects will improve our understanding of the conservation biology of forest ecosystems in Madagascar.

Many microscopic techniques with various functions have been developed to date, i.e., phase contrast microscopy, differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, confocal microscopy, two photon microscopy, superresolution microscopy, etc. However, person who is in charge of an experiment has to select one of the several microscopic techniques to achieve an experimental goal, which makes the biological assay time-consuming and expensive. To solve this problem, we have developed a microscopic system with various functions in one instrument based on the optical Fourier transformation with a lens system for detection while focusing on applicability and user-friendliness for biology. The present instrument can arbitrarily modulate the pupil function with a micro mirror array on the Fourier plane of the optical pathway for detection. We named the present instrument DiMPS (Distinct optical Modulated Pupil function System). The DiMPS is compatible with conventional fluorescent probes and illumination equipment, and gives us a Fourier-filtered image, a pseudo-relief image, and a deep focus depth. Furthermore, DiMPS achieved a resolution enhancement (pseudo-superresolution) of 110 nm through the subtraction of two images whose pupil functions are independently modulated. In maximum, the spatial and temporal resolution was improved to 120 nm and 2 ms, respectively. Since the DiMPS is based on relay optics, it can be easily combined with another microscopic instrument such as confocal microscope, and provides a method for multi-color pseudo-superresolution. Thus, the DiMPS shows great promise as a flexible optical microscopy technique in biological research fields.

The contribution of science and technology to this evolutionary process is probably the first to come to mind. The biology of Homo sapiens permits and promotes the development of technologies and artefacts that enable us to sense and reach physical niches previously inaccessible. This extends our biological capabilities, but is also expected to create selective pressures on these capabilities. The jury is yet out on the pace at which critical biological changes take place in evolution. There is no question, however, that the kinetics of technological and cultural change is much faster, rendering the latter particularly important in the biography of the individual and the species alike. The capacity of art to enrich human capabilities is recurrently discussed by philosophers and critics (e.g., Arsitotle/Poetics, Richards, 1925; Smith and Parks, 1951; Gibbs; 1994). Yet less attention is commonly allotted to the role of the arts in the aforementioned ongoing evolutional tango. My position is that the art of cinema is particularly suited to explore the intriguing dialogue between art and the brain. Further, in the following set of brief notes, intended mainly to trigger further thinking on the subject, I posit that cinema provides an unparalleled and highly rewarding experimentation space for the mind of the individual consumer of that art. In parallel, it also provides a useful and promising device for investigating brain and cognition.

"," Chemistry, Inorganic & Nuclear "10.1002/biof.1030,Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in physiology and diseases,"Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which acts as both the extracellular and intracellular messenger, exerts pleiotropic biological activities including regulation of formation of the vasculature, vascular barrier integrity, and lymphocyte trafficking. Many of these S1P actions are mediated by five members of the G protein-coupled S1P receptors (S1P1S1P5) with overlapping but distinct coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins. The biological activities of S1P are based largely on the cellular actions of S1P on migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Notably, S1P often exhibits receptor subtype-specific, bimodal effects in these cellular actions. For example, S1P1 mediates cell migration toward S1P, that is, chemotaxis, via Gi/Rac pathway whereas S1P2 mediates inhibition of migration toward a chemoattractant, that is, chemorepulsion, via G12/13/Rho pathway, which induces Rac inhibition. In addition, S1P1 mediates stimulation of cell proliferation through the Gi-mediated signaling pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and ERK whereas S1P2 mediates inhibition of cell proliferation through mechanisms involving G12/13/Rho/Rho kinase/PTEN-dependent Akt inhibition. These differential effects of S1P receptor subtypes on migration and proliferation lead to bimodal regulation of various biological responses. An observed biological response is likely determined by an integrated outcome of the counteracting signals input by S1P receptor subtypes. More recent studies identified the new intracellular targets of S1P including the inflammatory signaling molecule TRAF2 and histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. These interactions of S1P regulate NF-?B activity and gene expression, respectively. Development of S1P receptor agonists and antagonists with improved receptor subtype-selectivity, inhibitors, or modulators of sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes, and their optimal drug delivery system provide novel therapeutic tactics.

PDZ domains are found in most cell types, but neuronal proteins, for example, are particularly rich in these domains. The general function of PDZ domains is to bring proteins together within the appropriate cellular compartment, thereby facilitating scaffolding, signaling, and trafficking events. The many functions of PDZ domains under normal physiological as well as pathological conditions have been reviewed recently. In this review, we focus on the molecular details of how PDZ domains bind their protein ligands and their potential as drug targets in this context.

Effects of polyamines such as spermine, spermidine, and putrescine on the cytosolic and mitochondrial NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenases were analyzed kinetically. Spermine activated ICD2, the cytosolic NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase from rat liver with the increase in the maximal velocity and the decrease in the affinity for the substrates isocitrate and NADP. The activating action of spermine can be explained by ""the uncompetitive effect,"" and the dissociation constant of spermine for the enzyme-substrate complex was determined to be 1.68 mM. Spermidine and putrescine showed little or no effect. ICD1, the mitochondrial form of NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase from rat and porcine heart was inhibited by spermine effectively, and by spermidine and putrescine to a lesser extent. Spermine inhibited the enzyme competitively with respect to NADP, and noncompetitively with respect to isocitrate. Ki value of the enzyme for spermine was 1.3 mM. These results suggest that activation by spermine of cytosolic NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase can enhance the antioxidant activity by regeneration of GSH, and further is responsible for the stimulation of lipid biosynthesis in cytosol. Spermine may contribute to NADPH supply by enhancing transhydrogenase (EC1.6.1.2) activity through the spermine-dependent activation of Ca2+-incorporation to mitochondria.

Effects of these compounds on glucose metabolism in adipocytes have also been reported. However, their effects on skeletal muscle glucose uptake and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we investigated the direct effects and signaling pathways activated by honokiol and magnolol in skeletal muscle cells using L6 myotubes. We found that honokiol and magnolol dose-dependently acutely stimulated glucose uptake without synergistic effects of combined administration in L6 myotubes. Treatment with honokiol and magnolol also stimulated glucose transporter-4 translocation to the cell surface. Honokiol- and magnolol-stimulated glucose uptake was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Both honokiol and magnolol stimulated Akt phosphorylation, a key element in the insulin signaling pathway, which was completely inhibited by wortmannin.

HGF binds and activates the c-met receptor tyrosine kinase, but downstream signaling required for scattering remains poorly defined. We have applied a chemical biology approach to identify components of HGF signaling that are required for scattering in an in vitro model system. This approach yields a number of small molecules that block HGF-induced scattering, including a calcium channel blocker. We show that HGF stimulation results in sudden and transient increases in ion channel influxes at the plasma membrane. Although multiple channels occur in the membranes of our model system, we find that TrpC6 is specifically required for HGF-induced scattering. We further demonstrate that HGF-induced ion influxes through TrpC6 channels coincide with a transient increase in nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)-dependent gene transcription and that NFAT-dependent gene transcription is required for HGF-induced cell scattering.

The proteins Hof1p, Cyk3p, Inn1p and Myo1p each represent one of the four genetically defined and partially complementary pathways of cytokinesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that the osmosensor Sho1p is required for correct cell-cell separation. Shortly before cytokinesis Sho1p sequentially assembles with Hof1p, Inn1p and Cyk3p, into a complex (the HICS complex) that might help to connect the membrane with the actin-myosin ring. The HICS complex is formed exclusively through interactions between three SH3 domains located in Cyk3p, Hof1p and Sho1p, and five acceptor sites found in Cyk3p, Hof1p and Inn1p. Owing to the overlapping binding specificities of its members the HICS complex is best described as ensembles of isomeric interaction states that precisely coordinate the different functions of the interactors during cytokinesis.

However, characterization and/or propagation of human DPs have been unsatisfactory because of the lack of efficient isolation methods and the loss of innate characteristics in vitro. We hypothesized that culture conditions sustaining the intrinsic molecular signature of the human DP could facilitate expansion of functional DP cells. To test this, we first characterized the global gene expression profile of microdissected, non-cultured human DPs. We performed a 'two-step' microarray analysis to exclude the influence of unwanted contaminants in isolated DPs and successfully identified 118 human DP signature genes, including 38 genes listed in the mouse DP signature. The bioinformatics analysis of the DP gene list revealed that WNT, BMP and FGF signaling pathways were upregulated in intact DPs and addition of 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime, recombinant BMP2 and basic FGF to stimulate these respective signaling pathways resulted in maintained expression of in situ DP signature genes in primarily cultured human DP cells. More importantly, the exposure to these stimulants restored normally reduced DP biomarker expression in conventionally cultured DP cells. Cell growth was moderate in the newly developed culture medium. However, rapid DP cell expansion by conventional culture followed by the restoration by defined activators provided a sufficient number of DP cells that demonstrated characteristic DP activities in functional assays. The study reported here revealed previously unreported molecular mechanisms contributing to human DP properties and describes a useful technique for the investigation of human DP biology and hair follicle bioengineering.

One goal of the moratorium was to hold a conference (Asilomar) to evaluate the risks, if any, of this new technology. The Asilomar conference concluded that recombinant DNA research should proceed but under strict guidelines. The furor surrounding the recent genetic manipulation of the transmissibility of avian influenza virus H5N1 led to a short-term moratorium that has been extended indefinitely. The question is how long should the moratorium remain in place, or should it be permanent? Voltaire observed, ""History never repeats itself; man always does.""

The many-body problem, chaotic avalanches, materials properties, biological organisms, and weather systems are better addressed at higher levels.Animals are highly organized, goal-directed, adaptive, selectionist, information-preserving, functionally redundant, multicellular, quasi-autonomous. highly mobile, reproducing, dissipative systems that conserve many fundamental features over remarkably long periods of time at the species level. Animal brains consist of massive, layered networks of specialized signaling cells with 10,000 communication points per cell, and interacting up to 1000 Hz. Neurons begin to divide and differentiate very early in gestation, and continue to develop until middle age.Waking brains operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium under delicate homeostatic control, making them extremely sensitive to a range of physical and chemical stimuli, highly adaptive, and able to produce a remarkable range of goal-relevant actions.Consciousness is ""a difference that makes a difference"" at the level of massive neuronal interactions in the most parallel-interactive anatomical structure of the mammalian brain, the cortico-thalamic (C-T) system. Other brain structures are not established to result in direct conscious experiences, at least in humans. However, indirect extra-cortical influences on the C-T system are pervasive. Learning, brain plasticity and major life adaptations may require conscious cognition.While brains evolved over hundreds of millions of years, and individual brains grow over months, years and decades, conscious events appear to have a duty cycle of similar to 100 ms, fading after a few seconds. They can of course be refreshed by inner rehearsal, re-visualization, or attending to recurrent stimulus sources.These very distinctive brain events are needed when animals seek out and cope with new, unpredictable and highly valued life events, such as evading predators, gathering critical information, seeking mates and hunting prey. Attentional selection of conscious events can be observed behaviorally in animals showing coordinated receptor orienting, flexible responding, alertness, emotional reactions, seeking, motivation and curiosity, as well as behavioral surprise and cortical and autonomic arousal. Brain events corresponding to attentional selection are prominent and widespread. Attention generally results in conscious experiences, which may be needed to recruit widespread processing resources in the brain.Many neuronal processes never become conscious, such as the balance system of the inner ear. An air traveler may ""see"" the passenger cabin tilt downward as the plane tilts to descend for a landing. That visual experience occurs even at night, when the traveler has no external frame of spatial reference. The passenger's body tilt with respect to gravity is detected unconsciously via the hair cells of the vestibular canals, which act as liquid accelerometers. However, that sensory activity is not experienced directly. It only becomes conscious via vision and the body senses. The vestibular sense is therefore quite different from visual perception, which ""reports"" accurately to a conscious field of experience, so that we can point accurately to a bright star on a dark night. Vestibular input is also precise but unconscious.Conscious cognition is therefore a distinct kind of brain event. Many of its features are well established, and must be accounted for by any adequate theory. No non-biological examples are known.Penrose and Hameroff have proposed that consciousness may be viewed as a fundamental problem in quantum physics. Specifically, their 'orchestrated objective reduction' (Orch-OR) hypothesis posits that conscious states arise from quantum computations in the microtubules of neurons. However, a number of microtubule-associated proteins are found in both plant and animal cells (like neurons) and plants are not generally considered to be conscious.Current quantum-level proposals do not explain the prominent empirical features of consciousness. Notably, they do not distinguish between closely matched conscious and unconscious brain events, as cognitive-biological theories must. About half of the human brain does not support conscious contents directly, yet neurons in these ""unconscious"" brain regions contain large numbers of microtubules.QM phenomena are famously observer-dependent, but to the best of our knowledge it has not been shown that they require a conscious observer, as opposed to a particle detector. Conscious humans cannot detect quantum events ""as such"" without the aid of special instrumentation. Instead, we categorize the wavelengths of light into conscious sensory events that neglect their quantum mechanical properties.In science the burden of proof is on the proposer, and this burden has not yet been met by quantum-level proposals. While in the future we may discover quantum effects that bear distinctively on conscious cognition 'as such,' we do not have such evidence today. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main dysfunctions include appearance of enlarged hepatocytes, impaired liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH), development of hepatic steatosis, reduction of secretion of proteins and alterations in the hepatic sinusoid. RNA binding proteins are involved in the regulation of gene expression in all tissues including regulation of biological processes in the liver. This review is focused on the role of a conserved, multi-functional RNA-binding protein, CUGBP1, in the development of aging phenotype in the liver. CUGBP1 has been identified as a protein which binds to RNA CUG repeats expanded in Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1). CUGBP1 is highly expressed in the liver and regulates translation of proteins which are critical for maintenance of liver functions. In livers of young mice, CUGBP1 forms complexes with eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 and supports translation of C/EBP beta and HDAC1 proteins, which are involved in liver growth, differentiation and liver cancer. Aging changes several signaling pathways which lead to the elevation of the CUGBP1-eIF2c alpha complex and to an increase of translation of C/EBP beta and HDAC1. These proteins form multi-protein complexes with additional transcription factors and with chromatin remodeling proteins causing epigenetic alterations of gene expression in livers of old mice. It appears that CUGBP1-mediated translational elevation of HDAC1 is one of the key events in the epigenetic changes in livers of old mice, leading to the development of age-associated dysfunctions of the liver.

This protein is expressed and secreted by immune cells, hepatocytes, and renal tubular cells in various pathologic states. NGAL has recently generated great interest as an early biomarker of renal injury. However, like many other endogenous biomarkers it is not produced by just one cell type and it exists in more than one molecular form. As recent research has shown different pathological conditions may involved in the production of this molecule. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the biology of NGAL and examines the role of this molecule of acute renal injury as well as in other pathologic conditions like neoplasia, anemia, pregnancy, cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease and in cardiorenal syndrome. Commercial and research immunoassays are used to measure NGAL in both plasma and urine but these assays are not standardized. The existence of different molecular forms of NGAL and their expression at various disease states further complicates the interpretation of the results. Pre analytical issues and biological variation are also not fully elucidated.

The purpose of this review is to outline why investigative safety science is a competitive advantage for the pharmaceutical industry.Areas covered: The article discusses the essential goals for modern investigative toxicologists including: cross-species target biology; molecular pathways of toxicity; and development of predictive tools, models and biomarkers that allow discovery researchers and clinicians to anticipate safety problems and plan ways to address them, earlier than ever before. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the importance of investigating unanticipated clinical safety signals through a combination of mechanistic preclinical studies and/or molecular characterization of clinical samples from affected organs.Expert opinion: The traditional boundaries between pharma industry teams focusing on safety/efficacy and preclinical/clinical development are rapidly disappearing in favor of translational safety science-centric organizations with a vision of bringing more effective medicines forward safely and quickly. Comparative biology and mechanistic toxicology approaches facilitate: i) identifying translational safety biomarkers; ii) identifying new drug targets/indications; and iii) mitigating off-target toxicities. These value-adding safety science contributions will change traditional toxicologists from side-effect identifiers to drug development enablers.

Advances in pharmacological treatments beyond the currently approved SSRIs are needed.Areas covered: Background on PTSD, as well as the neurobiology of stress responding and fear conditioning, is provided. Clinical and preclinical data for investigational agents with diverse pharmacological mechanisms are summarized.Expert opinion: Advances in the understanding of stress biology and mechanisms of fear conditioning plasticity provide a rationale for treatment approaches that may reduce hyperarousal and dysfunctional aversive memories in PTSD. One challenge is to determine if these components are independent or reflect a common underlying neurobiological alteration. Numerous agents reviewed have potential for reducing PTSD core symptoms or targeted symptoms in chronic PTSD. Promising early data support drug approaches that seek to disrupt dysfunctional aversive memories by interfering with consolidation soon after trauma exposure, or in chronic PTSD, by blocking reconsolidation and/or enhancing extinction. Challenges remain for achieving selectivity when attempting to alter aversive memories. Targeting the underlying traumatic memory with a combination of pharmacological therapies applied with appropriate chronicity, and in combination with psychotherapy, is expected to substantially improve PTSD treatment.

To explore how these changes interact with lentiviral infections in vivo, animals from two nonhuman primate species (African green monkeys and pig-tailed macaques) were provided morphine and studied using a systems biology approach. Biological specimens were obtained from multiple sources (e. g. lymph node, colon, cerebrospinal fluid, and peripheral blood) before and after the administration of morphine (titrated up to a maximum dose of 5 mg/kg over a period of 20 days). Cellular immune, plasma cytokine, and proteome changes were measured and morphine-induced changes in these parameters were assessed on an interorgan, interindividual, and interspecies basis. In both species, morphine was associated with decreased levels of Ki-67(+) T-cell activation but with only minimal changes in overall T-cell counts, neutrophil counts, and NK cell counts. Although changes in T-cell maturation were observed, these varied across the various tissue/fluid compartments studied. Proteomic analysis revealed a morphine-induced suppressive effect in lymph nodes, with decreased abundance of protein mediators involved in the functional categories of energy metabolism, signaling, and maintenance of cell structure. These findings have direct relevance for understanding the impact of heroin addiction and the opioids used to treat addiction as well as on the potential interplay between opioid abuse and the immunological response to an infective agent.

Perturbations to these signaling networks may attract cells to new malignant signaling and phenotypic states, termed cancer network attractors, that result in cancer development. As different cancer cells reach these malignant states by accumulating different molecular alterations, uncovering these mechanisms represents a grand challenge in cancer biology. Addressing this challenge will require new systems-based strategies that capture the intrinsic properties of cancer signaling networks and provide deeper understanding of the processes by which genetic lesions perturb these networks and lead to disease phenotypes. Network biology will help circumvent fundamental obstacles in cancer treatment, such as drug resistance and metastasis, empowering personalized and tumor-specific cancer therapies.

Preclinical assessment of the risk of tumor formation in this context poses considerable scientific and regulatory challenges, especially because animal xenograft models may not properly reflect the long-term tumorigenic potential of human cells. A better understanding of the biology of spontaneously occurring teratomas and related tumors in humans can help to guide efforts to assess and minimize the potential hazards of embryonic stem cell or induced pluripotent stem cell therapeutics. Here we review the features of teratomas derived experimentally from human pluripotent stem cells and argue that they most closely resemble spontaneous benign teratomas that occur early in both mouse and human life. The natural history and pathology of these spontaneously occurring teratomas provide important clues for preclinical safety assessment and patient monitoring in trials of stem cell therapies.

The interactions between the coagulation cascade, endothelium, and regulation of angiogenesis are complex and drive glioblastoma growth and invasion. We reviewed the incidence of VTE in HGG, the biology of the coagulome as related to glioblastoma progression, prevention and treatment of thrombosis, and the putative role of anticoagulants as anti-cancer therapy. VTE can be significantly reduced during the postoperative period with adherence to the use of mechanical and medical thromboprophylaxis. Activation of the coagulation cascade occurs throughout the course of disease because of a variety of complex interactions, including tumor hypoxia, upregulation of VEGR expression, and increases in both tumor cell-specific tissue factor (TF) expression and inducible TF expression in numerous intrinsic regulatory pathways. Long-term anticoagulation to prevent VTE is an attractive therapy; however, the therapeutic window is narrow and current data do not support its routine use. Most patients with proven symptomatic VTE can be safely anticoagulated, including those receiving anti-VEGF therapy, such as bevacizumab. Initial therapy should include low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and protracted anticoagulant treatment, perhaps indefinitely, is indicated for patients with HGG because of the ongoing risk of thrombosis. A variety of coagulation- and tumor-related proteins, such as TF and circulating microparticles, may serve as potential disease-specific biomarkers in relation to disease recurrence, monitoring of therapy, and as potential therapeutic targets.

A multitude of molecular profiling studies in recent years has unveiled a number of genetic abnormalities unique to pediatric brain tumors. It has now become clear that brain tumors that arise in children have distinct pathogenesis and biology, compared with their adult counterparts, even for those with indistinguishable histopathology. Some of the molecular features are so specific to a particular type of tumors, such as the presence of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene for pilocytic astrocytomas or SMARCB1 mutations for atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, that they could practically serve as a diagnostic marker on their own. Expression profiling has resolved the existence of 4 molecular subgroups in medulloblastomas, which positively translated into improved prognostication for the patients. The currently available molecular markers, however, do not cover all tumors even within a single tumor entity. The molecular pathogenesis of a large number of pediatric brain tumors is still unaccounted for, and the hierarchy of tumors is likely to be more complex and intricate than currently acknowledged. One of the main tasks of future molecular analyses in pediatric neuro-oncology, including the ongoing genome sequencing efforts, is to elucidate the biological basis of those orphan tumors. The ultimate goal of molecular diagnostics is to accurately predict the clinical and biological behavior of any tumor by means of their molecular characteristics, which is hoped to eventually pave the way for individualized treatment.

However, lignin engineering also results in profound metabolic consequences in the plant. We used a systems biology approach to study the plant's response to lignin perturbations. To this end, inflorescence stems of 20 Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, each mutated in a single gene of the lignin biosynthetic pathway (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase1 [PAL1], PAL2, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase [C4H], 4-coumarate:CoA ligase1 [4CL1], 4CL2, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase1 [CCoAOMT1], cinnamoyl-CoA reductase1 [CCR1], ferulate 5-hydroxylase [F5H1], caffeic acid O-methyltransferase [COMT], and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase6 [CAD6], two mutant alleles each), were analyzed by transcriptomics and metabolomics. A total of 566 compounds were detected, of which 187 could be tentatively identified based on mass spectrometry fragmentation and many were new for Arabidopsis. Up to 675 genes were differentially expressed in mutants that did not have any obvious visible phenotypes. Comparing the responses of all mutants indicated that c4h, 4cl1, ccoaomt1, and ccr1, mutants that produced less lignin, upregulated the shikimate, methyl-donor, and phenylpropanoid pathways (i.e., the pathways supplying the monolignols). By contrast, f5h1 and comt, mutants that provoked lignin compositional shifts, downregulated the very same pathways. Reductions in the flux to lignin were associated with the accumulation of various classes of 4-O- and 9-O-hexosylated phenylpropanoids. By combining metabolomic and transcriptomic data in a correlation network, system-wide consequences of the perturbations were revealed and genes with a putative role in phenolic metabolism were identified. Together, our data provide insight into lignin biosynthesis and the metabolic network it is embedded in and provide a systems view of the plant's response to pathway perturbations.

Many individual components and pathways operating during plant defense have been identified, but our knowledge of how these different components interact is still rudimentary. We generated a high-resolution time series of gene expression profiles from a single Arabidopsis thaliana leaf during infection by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Approximately one-third of the Arabidopsis genome is differentially expressed during the first 48 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring before significant lesion development. We used computational tools to obtain a detailed chronology of the defense response against B. cinerea, highlighting the times at which signaling and metabolic processes change, and identify transcription factor families operating at different times after infection. Motif enrichment and network inference predicted regulatory interactions, and testing of one such prediction identified a role for TGA3 in defense against necrotrophic pathogens. These data provide an unprecedented level of detail about transcriptional changes during a defense response and are suited to systems biology analyses to generate predictive models of the gene regulatory networks mediating the Arabidopsis response to B. cinerea.

We investigated whether the scaling law of gravitropic performance (power of -2 of stem diameter) derived from integrative biomechanical modeling is disturbed by ontogeny or environment, then discuss the silvicultural and dendroecological consequences.Methods: In a beech (Fagus sylvatica) plantation, four plots with different initial planting densities evolved without any intervention for 26 yr. Regular tree inventories and a silvicultural model were used to monitor competition over time in each plot. The radial production of tension wood was quantified using a cross-section of the stems at 1.30-m height, and an integrative biomechanical model computed the tree gravitropic performance over time.Key results: All trees developed tension wood over the whole period, with higher amounts at the youngest age, resulting in theoretical lean corrections of ca. 20-30 on the first 4 m of the stem over the whole period. The scaling law of gravitropic performance is slightly larger than the power of -2 of stem diameter.Conclusions: Gravitropic performance in forest ecosystems is mainly limited by size (diameter). Ontogenic acclimation of tension wood formation allows the youngest trees to be more reactive. No additional effect of spacing was found. However, silviculture influences size and, therefore, tree reactivity at a given age. Such results will be helpful for dendroecological approaches that use wood as a marker of environmental disturbances or a trait linked to plant strategies.

Here, we aimed to compare one of the molecular changes most explicitly associated with adenoma to carcinoma progression, that is, chromosomal instability, between flat and polypoid colorectal adenomas.Experimental Design: Consecutive series of 83 flat and 35 polypoid adenomas were analyzed for DNA copy number changes using a high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization platform, micro-satellite instability (MSI) status, and for mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD3, CD8, and FoxP3 expression were carried out.Results: Patterns of DNA copy number changes differed between the two phenotypes, with significantly more frequent loss of 5q14.3 and 5q15-q31.1 in flat adenomas, whereas losses of 1p36.32-p35.3, 10q25.3, 17p12, and chromosome 18 were more frequent in polypoid adenomas (false discovery rate < 0.2). MSI was observed in one flat adenoma. As the 5q15-q31.1 region harbors the APC locus, APC mutation status was investigated, showing significantly less mutations in flat adenomas (P = 0.04). An initial exploration of a possible association of 5q loss with inflammation indicated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were more abundant in the stroma of flat adenomas compared with that of polypoid adenomas.Conclusion: Flat and polypoid adenomas have partially distinct chromosomal profiles, consistent with differences in the biology underlying these phenotypes. Alterations more specific to flat adenomas, in particular 5q loss, may be associated with inflammation. Clin Cancer Res; 18(17); 4560-9. (C) 2012 AACR.

The synthetic activity of vitellocytes plays two important functions in the developmental biology of cestodes: (1) their shell-globules serve in eggshell formation; and (2) their accumulated reserves of glycogen and lipids represent a food source for the developing embryo. In A. menezesi, vitelline follicles consist of cells at various stages of development, from peripheral, immature cells of the gonial type to mature cells towards the centre of the follicle. These stages are: (I) immature; (II) early differentiation; (III) advanced maturation; and (IV) mature. Gradual changes involved in this process occur within each stage. Vitellogenesis involves: (1) an increase in cell volume; (2) the development of a smooth endoplasmic reticulum and an accelerated formation and accumulation of both unsaturated and saturated lipid droplets, along with their continuous enlargement and fusion; (3) the formation of individual beta-glycogen particles and their accumulation in the form of glycogen islands scattered among lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of maturing and mature vitellocytes; (4) the rapid accumulation of large, moderately saturated lipid droplets accompanied by dense accumulations of beta-glycogen along with proteinaceous shell-globules or shell-globule clusters in the peripheral layer during the advanced stage of maturation; (5) the development of cisternae of granular endoplasmic reticulum that produce dense, proteinaceous shell-globules; (6) the development of Golgi complexes engaged in the packaging of this material; and (7) the progressive and continuous enlargement of shell-globules into very large clusters in the peripheral layer during the advanced stage of maturation. Vitellogenesis in A. menezesi, only to some extent, resembles that previously described for four other trypanorhynchs. It differs in: (i) the reversed order of secretory activities in the differentiating vitellocytes, namely the accumulation of large lipid droplets accompanied by glycogenesis or beta-glycogen formation during early differentiation (stage II), i.e. before the secretory activity, which is predominantly protein synthesis for shell-globule formation (stage III); (ii) the very heavy accumulation of large lipid droplets during the final stage of cytodifferentiation (stage IV); and (iii) the small number of beta-glycogen particles present in mature vitellocytes. Ultracytochemical staining with PA-TCH-SP for glycogen proved positive for a small number of beta-glycogen particles in differentiating and mature vitellocytes. Hypotheses, concerning the interrelationships of patterns of vitellogenesis, possible modes of egg formation, embryonic development and life-cycles, are commented upon.

While over recent years, EBV associated lymphomas that arise in patients with known defects in cellular immunity are relatively well characterized, these diseases are becoming increasingly recognized in patients without overt immunodeficiency. Improved understanding of the biology of these lymphomas including elucidating the role that EBV plays in their pathogenesis has paved the way for improved therapies targeted at critical signaling pathways as well as the development of novel cellular therapies. In this review, we focus on recent progress that has been made in the biology and treatment of the rare EBV-associated disorder lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) and also discuss other EBV-associated processes that occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.

Given that, it is not surprising that there exist mediastinal lymphomas that do not fit well into either category but have clinical and morphologic features overlapping and transitional between PMBL and CHL-NS. The term mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) has been used for these tumors, which are included in the World Health Organization classification as ""B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma."" Although several studies have evaluated different therapeutic strategies in PMBL and CHL-NS, there is a paucity of prospective experience treating MGZL, given its rarity and relatively recent recognition. Historically, diseases that today would be categorized as MGZL were probably called "" anaplastic large-cell lymphoma Hodgkin-like,"" and their outcome with standard approaches was poor, with short overall survivals. In this review-following a discussion of the biology and clinical features of MGZL, and how they compare to PMBL and CHL-NS-we outline how the treatment of PMBL and CHL-NS has evolved in recent years, and how we believe MGZL should be approached therapeutically.

These channels, known as thermoTRPs, cover the entire spectrum of temperatures, from noxious cold (< 15 degrees C) to injurious heat (> 42 degrees C). In addition, dysfunction of these channels contributes to the thermal hypersensitivity that accompanies painful conditions. Moreover, because of their wide tissue and cellular distribution, thermoTRPs are also involved in the pathophysiology of several diseases, from inflammation to cancer.Areas covered: Although the number of thermoTRPs is increasing with the identification of novel members such as TRPM3, we will cover the recent advances in the pharmacology of the classical thermosensory channels, namely TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, TRPV4, TRPM8 and TRPA1. This review will focus on the therapeutic progress carried out for all these channels and will highlight the tenet that TRPV1, TRPM8 and TRPA1 are the most exploited channels, and that the interest on TRPV3 and TRPV4 is growing with the first TRPV3 antagonist that moves into Phase-II clinical trials. In contrast, the pharmacology of TRPV2 is yet in its infancy.Expert opinion: Despite the tremendous academic and industrial investment to develop therapeutic modulators of thermoTRPs, it apparently seems that we are still far from the first successful product, although hope is maintained high for all compounds currently in clinical trials. A major concern has been the appearance of side effects. A better knowledge of the thermosensory protein networks (signal-plexes), along with the application of system biology approaches may provide novel strategies to modulate thermoTRPs activity with improved therapeutic index. A case in point is TRPV1, where acting on interacting proteins is providing new therapeutic opportunities.

The biology of the pathogen is still partly unclear, particular with respect to its sexual reproduction and primary mode of infection. Zoospores released from sporangia of Pustula helianthicola were isolated individually and used for the inoculation of sunflower in order to generate unithallic, genetically homogenous infections. Single zoospore inoculation of young seedlings resulted in mitotic sporulation within subepidermal blisters on cotyledons and true leaves after approximately 2 weeks. Three weeks postinoculation, the infected plants started forming oospores, hence indicating homothallic sexual reproduction of the pathogen. The development of oogonia and antheridia was studied using light and fluorescence microscopy. Oospores were isolated from infected plant tissue and used for infection and germination studies. Microscopic observation of isolated oospores showed germination that formed sessile vesicle-like structures, germ sporangia or only germ tubes. The rate of germination reached approximately 40 %. Germination was not dependant on a resting phase after oospore formation. Oospores applied to the above ground parts of sunflower seedlings lead to infections within a similar time frame as was achieved with mitotic sporangia. The results underline the importance of oospores for primary infection at the beginning of the season and for long-distance dispersal of the pathogen with sunflower seeds contaminated by oospores.

Monitoring pH changes of living cells and imaging the regions with abnormal pH-values, in vivo, could provide invaluable physiological and pathological information for the research of the cell biology, pharmacokinetics, diagnostics, and therapeutics of certain diseases such as cancer. Naturally, pH-sensitive fluorescence imaging of bulk tissues has been attracting great attentions from the realm of near infrared diffuse fluorescence tomography (DFT). Herein, the feasibility of quantifying pH-induced fluorescence changes in turbid medium is investigated using a continuous-wave difference-DFT technique that is based on the specifically designed computed tomography-analogous photon counting system and the Born normalized difference image reconstruction scheme. We have validated the methodology using two-dimensional imaging experiments on a small-animal-sized phantom, embedding an inclusion with varying pH-values. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately localize the target with a quantitative resolution to pH-sensitive variation of the fluorescent yield, and might provide a promising alternative method of pH-sensitive fluorescence imaging in addition to the fluorescence-lifetime imaging.

The recipient ectocortex may be burred to expose vessels and osteocytes to maximize healing. The purpose of this study was to determine whether abrading the recipient site improves the volume of onlay graft.The parietal bones of 17 rabbits were sectioned into split-thickness and full-thickness grafts. The right frontal cortex was abraded with a bur to punctate bleeding. Pairs of split-thickness (n = 48) or full-thickness (n = 20) grafts were onlayed to the burred right frontal bone and to the nonburred left frontal bone. Micro-computed tomography was used to determine graft volume immediately postoperatively and 16 weeks later. Histology, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, was performed to quantify vascular channels and osteoclasts per high-power field 10 days postoperatively.Split-thickness graft volume decreased 58.0% when placed on the burred calvarial site, compared with grafts on the nonburred cortex (28.4%) (P = 0.01). Full-thickness grafts showed a similar trend: greater resorption (39.1%) when onlayed onto abraded calvaria compared with nonburred ectocortex (26.0%) (P = 0.11). Split-thickness graft orientation (cortical vs cancellous side in contact with the recipient site) did not affect resorption (P = 0.67). Onlay grafts placed on the burred recipient site had more vascular channels (11.8) and osteoclasts (5.7), compared with grafts over nonabraded cortex (3.4 and 4.2, respectively) (P < 0.05).Burring the recipient site cortex before onlay cranial bone grafting promotes resorption, possibly by increasing vascularization and osteoclastic activity. This technique cannot be recommended.

Genome-scale data have enabled the identification of the set of genes that distinguishes macrophages from other cell types and the ways in which thousands of genes are regulated in response to pathogen challenge. Although there has been a focus on a small subset of lineage-enriched transcription factors, such as PU.1, more than one-half of the transcription factors in the genome can be expressed in macrophage lineage cells under some state of activation, and they interact in a complex network. The network architecture is conserved across species, but many of the target genes evolve rapidly and differ between mouse and human. The data and publication deluge related to macrophage biology require the development of new analytical tools and ways of presenting information in an accessible form.

The interdigitating microelectrodes of our portable system were produced by microfabrication technology with a width of 8 mu m. a gap of 8 mu m, and a length of 500 mu m. These microelectrodes provided a high electric field for AC impedance measurements. When mouse L929 cells were cultured on the electrode surface and pre-coated with poly-L-lysine, the changes in the impedance on the interdigitating electrodes represented the lag, log, and stationary phases of a typical cell growth curve. The impedance measurement result was fitted to an equivalent circuit, which showed that the capacitance signal was the major contributor to the total impedance of the cell culture. The capacitance arises from the cell capacitance, the double-layer capacitance and the capacitance of the poly-L-lysine-coated surface, and the changes in capacitance were probably due to cell proliferation and the resulting changes in cell metabolites. To make the device portable and provide rapid results, we designed a novel impedance detection system comprised of a microprocessor, an AD5933 impedance converter (IC), and the interdigitating microelectrodes. This device was successfully used to observe the changes in the metabolism and proliferation of L929 cells at different stages of cell growth with low cell concentrations. Further, the portable impedance measurement device is a useful analytical tool for monitoring cell growth. It will integrate easily with wireless circuits for applications in aseptic cell biology.

CO2 measurements during bioreactor cultivation and use of C-13-labelled formate demonstrated that formate is almost completely oxidized to CO2. The deletion of fdhF (cg0618), annotated as formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and located in a cluster of genes conserved in the family Corynebacteriaceae, prevented formate utilization. Similarly, deletion of fdhD (cg0616) resulted in the inability to metabolize formate and deletion of cg0617 markedly reduced formate utilization. These results illustrated that all three gene products are required for FDH activity. Growth studies with molybdate and tungstate indicated that the FDH from C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 is a molybdenum-dependent enzyme. The presence of 100 mM formate caused a 25% lowered growth rate during cultivation of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 wild-type in glucose minimal medium. This inhibitory effect was increased in the strains lacking FDH activity. Our data demonstrate that C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 possesses an FDH with a currently unknown electron acceptor. The presence of the FDH might help the soil bacterium C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 to alleviate growth retardation caused by formate, which is ubiquitously present in the environment.

This article summarizes evidence that suggests that the level of intracellular alpha-synuclein is critical for the onset of neurodegeneration with Lewy bodies and dependent, to a large extent, on lysosomal degradation. The function of other key proteins that emerged from genetics is discussed: Pink1 and Parkin regulate the degradation of damaged mitochondria by the lysosome (mitophagy). Glucocerebrosidase and ATP13A2 are important components of this degradative organelle. VPS35 and LRRK2 may regulate trafficking within lysosome-dependent pathways, such as autophagy and endosomal vesicle recycling. Clinically, diffuse alpha-synucleinopathy or dementia seems to correlate with mutations which interfere with the broader function of lysosomal pathways, whereas a predominantly motor syndrome and nigrostriatal degeneration is associated with specific defects in mitophagy. Based on these studies, it is proposed that a protein network involved in trafficking to, or degradation by, lysosomes could be sufficient to explain the phenotypic spectrum within PD in a unifying biochemical pathway.

This review addresses breast cancers of unusual histological subtype with an approximate incidence <= 1%. Given the rarity of these tumors, the literature contains primarily case reports, small series, and population-based studies. Data are heterogeneous and almost entirely retrospective, frequently gathered over long time periods, in the context of changing pathological techniques and reporting. In addition, our understanding of the disease biology and therapeutic context has also evolved significantly over this time. There is often limited information about the specific therapies used and the rationale for choosing such an approach. Meaningful comparisons of treatment modalities are not feasible and it is not possible to define management guidelines. Instead, this review correlates the available information to give an impression of how each subgroup behaves-of the favored surgical technique, responses to therapy, and prognosis-as well as the emerging molecular data, highlighting new research areas for potential target in clinical trials. Each tumor subtype described represents a small but real cohort of patients with breast cancer, and although inferences may be made from this review, we are mindful of the paucity of data. The management of each patient must be considered in the context of their unique clinical presentation and correlated with the evidence-based principles that apply to more common breast cancer histologies.

It contributes significantly to infant mortality and has serious implications in adult cardiology. Although left-sided CHD is known to be highly heritable, the underlying genetic determinants are largely unidentified. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of structural genomic variation on left-sided CHD and compared multiplex families (464 individuals with 174 affecteds (37.5%) in 59 multiplex families and 8 trios) to 1,582 well-phenotyped controls. 73 unique inherited or de novo CNVs in 54 individuals were identified in the left-sided CHD cohort. After stringent filtering, our gene inventory reveals 25 new candidates for LS-CHD pathogenesis, such as SMC1A, MFAP4, and CTHRC1, and overlaps with several known syndromic loci. Conservative estimation examining the overlap of the prioritized gene content with CNVs present only in affected individuals in our cohort implies a strong effect for unique CNVs in at least 10% of left-sided CHD cases. Enrichment testing of gene content in all identified CNVs showed a significant association with angiogenesis. In this first family-based CNV study of left-sided CHD, we found that both co-segregating and de novo events associate with disease in a complex fashion at structural genomic level. Often viewed as an anatomically circumscript disease, a subset of left-sided CHD may in fact reflect more general genetic perturbations of angiogenesis and/or vascular biology.

Cells of the rod-shaped bacterium Myxococcus xanthus move on surfaces with defined leading and lagging cell poles. Occasionally, cells undergo reversals, which correspond to an inversion of the leading-lagging pole polarity axis. Reversals are induced by the Frz chemosensory system and depend on relocalization of motility proteins between the poles. The Ras-like GTPase MglA localizes to and defines the leading cell pole in the GTP-bound form. MglB, the cognate MglA GTPase activating protein, localizes to and defines the lagging pole. During reversals, MglA-GTP and MglB switch poles and, therefore, dynamically localized motility proteins switch poles. We identified the RomR response regulator, which localizes in a bipolar asymmetric pattern with a large cluster at the lagging pole, as important for motility and reversals. We show that RomR interacts directly with MglA and MglB in vitro. Furthermore, RomR, MglA, and MglB affect the localization of each other in all pair-wise directions, suggesting that RomR stimulates motility by promoting correct localization of MglA and MglB in MglA/RomR and MglB/RomR complexes at opposite poles. Moreover, localization analyses suggest that the two RomR complexes mutually exclude each other from their respective poles. We further show that RomR interfaces with FrzZ, the output response regulator of the Frz chemosensory system, to regulate reversals. Thus, RomR serves at the functional interface to connect a classic bacterial signalling module (Frz) to a classic eukaryotic polarity module (MglA/MglB). This modular design is paralleled by the phylogenetic distribution of the proteins, suggesting an evolutionary scheme in which RomR was incorporated into the MglA/MglB module to regulate cell polarity followed by the addition of the Frz system to dynamically regulate cell polarity.

We have identified a type of adult-onset hearing loss in Border Collies that appears to have a genetic cause, with an earlier age of onset (3-5 years) than typically expected for aging dogs (8-10 years). Studying this complex trait within pure breeds of dog may greatly increase our ability to identify genomic regions associated with risk of hearing impairment in dogs and in humans. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to detect loci underlying adult-onset deafness in a sample of 20 affected and 28 control Border Collies. We identified a region on canine chromosome 6 that demonstrates extended support for association surrounding SNP Chr6.25819273 (p-value = 1.09 x 10(-13)). To further localize disease-associated variants, targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of one affected and two unaffected dogs was performed. Through additional validation based on targeted genotyping of additional cases (n = 23 total) and controls (n = 101 total) and an independent replication cohort of 16 cases and 265 controls, we identified variants in USP31 that were strongly associated with adult-onset deafness in Border Collies, suggesting the involvement of the NF-kappa B pathway. We found additional support for involvement of RBBP6, which is critical for cochlear development. These findings highlight the utility of GWAS-guided fine-mapping of genetic loci using targeted NGS to study hereditary disorders of the domestic dog that may be analogous to human disorders.

Making our understanding of organic functioning all the more objective, life sciences yet exploit a paradigm which structurally rules out any opportunity to explain why biological phenomena are explainable the way we claim they are. As such a blind spot is constitutive of the disciplinary boundaries that condition and permit objective modelling, evolutions in scientists' mode of thought (i.e. paradigm shifts) may require at crucial points some interaction with epistemologists or historians of sciences. The model case of ontophylogenesis thus shows not only how such cooperation can be useful (both in normal science and in transitional contexts), but mostly why it plays a role in helping biology to get out of its intrinsic paradox. The most innovative feature of ontophylogenesis would thus be the following: to give account for the mode of intelligibility it chose by explaining it - in a truly Darwinian manner - in the core of the theory. Though this epistemic move definitely confirms biology to be an autonomous science as long as it faces its constitutive paradox, the methodological detour such realization implied would go through occasional interplay with ""exclusively reflexive approaches"" - that is to say, humanities.

It has generated important theories in immunology or neurology, and turns out to be a convincing framework to account for the intrinsic stochastic nature of core events in cellular biology. When looking back at the intellectual origins of selectionism, the essay by the German embryologist Wilhelm Roux, Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus (The Struggle of the Parts in the Organism - 1881) might be one, if not the earliest reference after the darwinian revolution. It describes the individual as a multilevel structure, where each level results from a 'darwinian' struggle of its parts (molecules, cells, tissues, organs). But Roux's theory, far from being a simple extension of natural selection, has complex and even conflictual relationships with darwinism. This essay is worth rediscovering as a subtle historical testimony of the evolutionary and developmental life sciences debates of its time. Moreover, some of its theses may also enrich some current debates among evolutionary biologists over levels of selection, and among cellular and molecular biologists over the status of determinism in biology today.

However, during the last 10 years, a wealth of studies has demonstrated that a given genotype can generate multiple phenotypes in identical environmental conditions, mainly because of the inherently probabilistic nature of the transcription process. It has also been shown that cells can tune this variability at the molecular level. Although previously described as a useless ""noise"", stochastic gene expression has now been shown by many authors to be an essential part of diverse biological processes. Chromatin dynamics having a central role in higher eukaryotes, we decided to investigate its involvement in the generation and control of stochasticity in gene expression (SGE). Our experiments reveal that the chromatin environment of a gene plays an important role in regulating SGE. Indeed, we find that histone acetylation and DNA methylation significantly affect SGE, suggesting that cells are able to adjust the variability of the expression of their genes through modification of chromatin marks. Given that the alteration of chromatin marks is itself subject to the expression of chromatin modifiers, our results shed light on a complex circular causality with on the one hand, the effect of gene expression on chromatin and on the other hand, the influence of the local chromatin environment of a gene on the dynamics of its expression.

Conversely, Darwinian models of chance and selection (Dennett, 1995; Kupiec, 1996, 2009) sit awkwardly with reductionist and holistic concepts, which they alternately challenge or approve of. I suggest that the juxtaposition of chance and the holism reductionism pair (at multiple levels, ontological and methodological, pertaining to the vision of scientific practice as well as to the foundations of a vision of Nature, implicit or explicit) allows the theorist to shed some new light on these perennial tensions in the conceptualisation of Life.

No, especially if one pays attention to the very different scientific context of that periods and takes care to distrust the concept of ""precursors"". Nonetheless, several thinkers of the Enlightenment, scientists or philosophers, have constructed an opposition between the random and order that shares some links with modern concerns. More precisely, philosophers like Diderot and some physicians, chemists or naturalists, have articulated the necessity and contingency in opposition to the idea of an absolute natural order and to any preformed ""germ"" explaining the development of animals. But I will argue that this subtle concept also diverges from the idea of a universal determinism developed by Laplace. There is a way to deal with natural necessity and the universal interdependence of phenomena without excluding the random, going beyond the classical - though posterior to the eighteenth century opposition between determinism and indeterminism. Particularly with Diderot, the Enlightenment presents an epistemology of the random loosely attached to the natural sciences, producing a philosophical reflection that can be linked with some modern issues of biology.I examine two examples: the criticism of the explanation of order by order, and the thesis that probability can tell us something about natural productions through the idea of randomized ""expression,"" e.g., stochastic expression of genes for modern molecular biology and expressions of natural forms for Diderot.

Studies from the last 40 years in computer science suggest that randomness is in fact able of doing much more and revealed unexpected possibilities which might appear impossible at first. Furthermore, it turns out that these discoveries are faster, cheaper and above all exponentially thriftier than their deterministic alternatives. This means that random explorations would almost surely generate a stochastic process way before any equivalent deterministic counterpart is found. It follows that most likely these processes are favored by evolution and should thus be known to anyone dealing with systems (alive or not) having access to random sources. This article presents some of these counter-intuitive results as a possible source of inspiration for studying systems fed with randomness. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To the authors' knowledge, only one case of CPA CM with concurrence of a neighboring DVA has been reported to date.CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors presented such vascular malformations in a 36-year-old man with progressive CPA syndrome during the course of six weeks. Preoperative neuroimaging suggested the diagnosis of an extra-axial hemorrhagic lesion in the CPA cistern with a cerebellar DVA in the close vicinity. The lesion was totally removed with the DVA untouched and was confirmed to be extra-axial in intimate contact with only the VII-VIII complex and the draining veins of DVA. Pathology revealed a CM. The patient underwent partial improvement in neurological function postoperatively. The radiographic follow-up at one year revealed no recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: CMs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any extra-axial hemorrhagic mass, especially with a DVA in the proximity. The coexistence of CM and DVA in CPA, although maybe just a coincidence, suggests the possibility of a new subtype of extra-axial CPA CM secondary to a preexisting DVA. A long-term follow-up is justified in discovering the potential mechanism and biology of such uncommon vascular malformations.

As part of a study aimed at elucidating the ecological impacts of these practices in Finland, piles of thinning residues of contrasting mass per unit area were established in 2004 around the base of individual Scots pine trees. As part of an NSF funded undergraduate training program, we have sampled the soil under these residue piles to evaluate the effect of leaving different amounts of residue on site to supply nutrients for remaining trees. Aboveground tree biomass production was significantly higher with higher levels of post-harvest residue retention. However, changes in soil chemistry were minimal and inconsistent with increasing residue amounts. Fine (<1 mm) tree root biomass showed little response to residue levels, but specific root length (length per unit mass) and ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance showed significant increases in the highest residue addition compared to the no-addition control. This may suggest a greater root searching strategy under high residue levels. There was no evidence of residue effect on soil nematodes but a consistent increase in abundance of 0-2 mm length enchytraeids with increased residue. This may be a result of higher rates of asexual reproduction under residues. Soil arthropod abundances did not correlate with residue levels. Even in this cold boreal forest ecosystem, it is possible that sampling 5 years after residue placement we may have missed some of the early influence of decomposition of more labile fractions of the residues on soil organisms and processes. It is likely that the current phase of woody material decomposition will have lesser effects on soil biology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The plant response to high salt concentrations is complex and comprehensive; it includes many different processes, which should be correctly coordinated. The effect of excessive salt concentrations on plants results in osmotic stress and creates an ionic inbalance due to the accumulation of toxic ions, such as Cl- and, especially, Na+. Salt stress also has negative impact on mineral homeostasis, in particular Ca2+ and K+. The progress in transcryptomics, genomics, and molecular biology revealed a new gene families that participate in the formation of salt stress response in plants. This review describes the fundamental principles and mechanisms of plant salt tolerance, maintenance of ion homeostasis. In this paper the detailed analysis of the maine transport membrane systems responsible for the transport of ions and their role in plant salt stress were conducted. The perspectives and directions for the further biotechnological and genetic improvement of salt tolerance in plants are underlied.

This may be due to the failure of drug developers to recognize that while there are mutations that predispose individuals to disease as they get older, the vast majority of neurodegenerative diseases arise from a confluence of multiple toxic insults. Thus, it is unlikely that the current single-target approach is going to yield useful drugs for these conditions. The identification of multi-target lead compounds is needed and their selection should be based upon a requirement for their efficacy in phenotypic screening assays that reflect the biology of the aging brain. This approach to neurodegenerative disease drug discovery is likely to produce safe and effective drugs.

It is a highly virulent virus that can spread quickly and can cause up to 100 % mortality in 3-10 days. WSSV is a large enveloped double stranded DNA virus belonging to genus Whispovirus of the virus family Nimaviridae. It has a wide host range among crustaceans and mainly affects commercially cultivated marine shrimp species. The virus infects all age groups causing large scale mortalities and the foci of infection are tissues of ectodermal and mesodermal origin, such as gills, lymphoid organ and cuticular epithelium. The whole genome sequencing of WSSV from China, Thailand and Taiwan have revealed minor genetic differences among different strains. There are varying reports regarding the factors responsible for WSSV virulence which include the differences in variable number of tandem repeats, the genome size and presence or absence of different proteins. Aim of this review is to give current information on the status, host range, pathogenesis and diagnosis of WSSV infection.

HPV has been found in wild and cultured penaeid shrimps throughout the world and there is high genetic variation among the different geographic isolates/host species. Given its high prevalence, wide distribution and ability to cause considerable economic loss in shrimp aquaculture industry, HPV deserves more attention than it has received. Till date, a total of four complete genome sequences of HPV have been reported in addition to a large number of partial sequences. HPV infection is seldom observed alone in epizootics and has occurred in multiple infections with other more pathogenic viruses and in most cases, heavy infections result in no visible inflammatory response. A great deal of information has accumulated in recent years on the clinical signs, geographical distribution, transmission and genetic diversity of HPV infection in shrimp aquaculture. However, the mechanism by which HPV enters the shrimp tissues and pathogenesis of virus is still unknown. To date, no effective prophylactic measures are available to reduce the infection in shrimps. To control and prevent HPV infection, considerable research efforts are on. This review provides information on current knowledge on HPV infection in penaeid shrimp aquaculture.

Despite presenting challenges to researchers in developing a cell line, the billion dollar aquaculture industry is under viral threat. Advances in molecular biology and various gene transfer technologies for immortalization of cells have resulted in the development of hundreds of cell lines from insects and mammals, but yet not a single cell line has been developed from shrimp and other marine invertebrates. Though improved growth and longevity of shrimp cells in vitro could be achieved by using modified growth media this did not make any leap to spontaneous transformation; probably due to the fact that shrimp cells inhibited neoplastic transformations. Oncogenic induction and immortalization are considered as the possible ways, and an exclusive medium for shrimp cell culture and an appropriate mode of transformation are crucial.

While cementum shares many properties in common with bone and dentin, it is a unique mineralized tissue and acellular cementum is critical for attachment of the tooth to the surrounding periodontal ligament (PDL). Resources for methodologies for hard tissues often overlook cementum and approaches that may be of value for studying this tissue. To address this issue, this report offers detailed methodology, as well as comparisons of several histological and immunohistochemical stains available for imaging the cementum-PDL complex by light microscopy. Notably, the infrequently used Alcian blue stain with nuclear fast red counterstain provided utility in imaging cementum in mouse, porcine and human teeth. While no truly unique extracellular matrix markers have been identified to differentiate cementum from the other hard tissues, immunohistochemistry for detection of bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin (OPN), and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is a reliable approach for studying both acellular and cellular cementum and providing insight into developmental biology of these tissues. Histological and immunohistochemical approaches provide insight on developmental biology of cementum.

This paper addresses the K-partition problem: given a collection of genotypes, partition those genotypes into K groups, each group being a sample of the K source populations that are represented in the collection of genotypes. This problem involves allocating genotypes to genetic groups while building those groups at the same time without the use of any other a priori information. FLOCK is a non-Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that uses an iterative method to partition a collection of genotypes into k groups. Rules to estimate K are formulated and their validity firmly established by running simulations under several migration rates, migration regimes, number of loci, and values of K FLOCK tended to build clusters largely consistent with the source samples. The performance of FLOCK was also compared with that of STRUCTURE and BAPS. FLOCK provided more accurate allocations to clusters and more reliable estimates of K; it also ran much faster than STRUCTURE. FLOCK is based on an entirely novel approach and provides a true alternative to the existing, MCMC based, algorithms.

The well-known ecological data are applied to new bone histological findings, which revealed expected and unexpected congruencies. The cortical bone matrix consists of avascular lamellar-zonal bone tissue type. The geometrical disposition of the growth marks (i.e., their spacing) shows an unusual pattern for lizards: the growth cycles maintain a constant thickness until the growth is terminated, which is marked by the development of the external fundamental system (efs). Minor resorption processes within the inner periosteal cortical region and the occurrence of these thick growth cycles in A. cristatus result in high mean bone compactness values. The reported life-history data from ecological studies and the hypothesized annuality of the growth cycles indicate that this first decline in annual bone deposition rate is not congruent with the attainment of sexual maturity. In contrast, this event might be indicated by other histological changes in the growth record of A. cristatus, which they share exclusively with their sister group, Conolophus subcristatus (Land Iguana). The bone matrix of the growth zones and annuli differ in their thickness, their color in polarized light, and vary slightly in the amount and shape of osteocyte lacunae in both A. cristatus and C. subcristatus. These well-recognizable growth zones and annuli of the growth cycles change their thickness abruptly within the reported time frame of the attainment of sexual maturity in A. cristatus.

Male and female B. melanostictus are sexually dimorphic in size. Adult males are significantly smaller than adult females, and the ratio of body size of females to males was 1:19. For breeding, the majority of males and females segregated on the basis of their size; larger males paired with larger females leaving smaller males to pair with smaller females. A positive correlation between the body sizes of mating partners provided evidence of size-assortative mating. Successful males were larger in length than their unsuccessful competitors. Operational sex ratio was skewed in the favor of males. A stereotypical spawning behavior was observed: At the initiation of spawning by the female, the male juxtaposed his cloaca with that of the female's followed by a few seconds of rigorous toe movements. Spawning was completed within 2-5 h. Subsequently, the female exhibited pseudo-spawning behavior once or twice. In the absence of more eggs, the male quickly released his clasp, and the pair separated.

Based on histopathology and molecular genetic alterations, ovarian carcinomas are divided into five main types [high-grade serous (70%), endometrioid (10%), clear-cell (10%), mucinous (3%), and low-grade serous carcinomas (<5%)] that account for over 95% of cases. These types are essentially distinct diseases, as indicated by differences in epidemiological and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, patterns of spread, and molecular events during oncogenesis, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis. For a successful specific treatment, reproducible histopathological diagnosis of the tumor cell type is critical. The five tumor types are morphologically diverse and resemble carcinomas of the uterus. Actually, recent investigations have demonstrated that a substantial number of cancers, traditionally thought to be primary ovarian tumors (particularly serous, endometrioid, and clear-cell carcinomas), originate in the fallopian tube and the endometrium and involve the ovary secondarily.

In this study, we investigated the expression and immunogenicity of several CTAs in patients with AL amyloidosis in a total of 38 bone marrow specimens by employing standard immunohistochemistry techniques on paraffin-embedded archival tissues. Plasma samples from 35 patients (27 with matched bone marrow samples) were also analyzed by ELISA for sero reactivity to a group of full-length CTA proteins. CT7 was present in 25/38 (66%) while CT10 was demonstrated in 3/38 and GAGE in 1/38 AL amyloid cases. The expression pattern was mostly focal. There were no significant differences with regard to organ involvement, response to treatment, or prognosis in CTA positive compared to negative cases. None of the specimens showed spontaneous humoral immunity to CT7, but sero reactivity was observed in individual patients to other CTAs.

The first objective was to develop a finite mixture model to model adipocyte bimodal distribution and to correlate these estimates with carcass and meat characteristics. A secondary objective was to demonstrate within-animal observed variability in adipocyte cellularity. Steers were finished on a high-grain diet (n = 14) or grass (n = 16). One 12-cm thick LM steak from each steer was collected during harvest. A probability density function was developed that partitioned the cell diameter population into small and large populations and described the relative proportions of cells for each animal in these 2 distinct populations. Five parameters were estimated through the finite mixture model: the means (mu(1) and mu(2)) and SD (sigma(1) and sigma(2)) for the small and large adipocyte populations, respectively, and a proportion parameter (p) describing the proportion of the distribution of the smaller adipocyte populations. The proportion parameter for all animals tended to be different (P = 0.07) between groups with the grain presenting a p of 22.5 +/- 12.5% and grass 16.2 +/- 4.7%. The mu(2) was correlated with yield grade (YG, P = 0.04), and sigma(2) with final BW, HCW, dressing percentage, YG, and quality grade score (P = 0.01). When correlating these parameters with the sensory data, mu(2) and sigma(2) were correlated with tenderness (P <= 0.05), sigma(1) and p with juiciness (P = 0.05), and p with overall palatability (P = 0.01). Adipocyte cellularity variability was measured by examining the results from 5 randomly chosen steers from each group (grain and grass). In this subset, the mu(1) and p ranged from 32.1 to 46.1 mu m and 1 to 27% for grass-finished steers, and ranged from 33.7 to 41.0 mu m and 10 to 48% for grain-finished steers. The mu(2) and (1 - p) ranged from 75.0 to 105.1 mu m and 73 to 99% for grass-finished steers, respectively, and ranged from 84.8 to 124.0 mu m and 52 to 90% for grain-finished steers, respectively. The finite mixture model provides a quantitative description of the distribution of adipocytes and contributes to explaining adipocyte biology. Adipocyte cellularity variability among samples within an animal is a topic that should be further evaluated, as well as its correlation with other factors, such as gene expression and hormone secretion.

The maximum volume of the transported droplets in the order of few microliters is thereby increased by three orders of magnitude compared to the constant voltage case, widening the application field of this method significantly. A drop-on-demand droplet generator is used to supply the liquid droplets into the system. The ejected sequence of picoliter-size droplets is guided along trajectories by the acoustic field and accumulates at the selected pressure node, merging into a single large droplet. Droplet movement is achieved by varying the reflector height. This also changes the intensity of the radiation pressure during droplet movement, which in turn could atomise the droplet. The acoustic force is adjusted by regulating the driving voltage of the actuator to keep the liquid droplet suspended in air and to prevent atomisation. In the herein presented levitation concept, liquids with a wide range of surface tension (water and tetradecane were tested) can be transported over distances of several mm. The aspect ratio of the droplet in the acoustic field is shown to be a good indicator for radiation pressure intensity and is kept between 1.1 and 1.4 during droplet transport. Despite certain limitations with volatile liquids, the presented acoustic levitator concept has the potential to expand the range of analytical characterisation and manipulation methods in applications ranging from chemistry and biology.

In bioinformatics, psychometrics, and data mining, hierarchical clustering techniques output the same mathematical objects, and practitioners have similar questions about the stability and ""generalizability"" of these summaries. This article describes the implementation of the geometric distance between trees developed by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann (2001) equally applicable to phylogenetic trees and hierarchical clustering trees, and shows some of the applications in evaluating tree estimates.In particular, since Billera et al. (2001) have shown that the space of trees is negatively curved (called a CAT(0) space), a collection of trees can naturally be represented as a tree. We compare this representation to the Euclidean approximations of treespace made available through both a classical multidimensional scaling and a Kernel multidimensional scaling of the matrix of the distances between trees.

However, wood extractives and hemicellulose were nearly complete dissolved out in preparation of the fiber, resulting in more serious water pollution and meanwhile bring a great waste of biological resources. Thereby, in order to find out the leaching rule of micro/nano particles from Eucalyptus camaldulensis wood, Eucalyptus camaldulensis wood was treated in alkaline solutions at room temperature and the extractives obtained was analyzed by Sizer. The results were following as: (1) Different alkali, its concentration and extraction time have a significant different influence on the particles leaching with the different diameters. And the KOH, NaOH, LiOH all had impacts on the volume fraction and number fraction of leached particles and the significance reduced in turn at the same other conditions. (2) The optimum concentration of KOH, NaOH and LiOH was 17.5%, 18.5% and 15.0% at room temperature, respectively. The optimum extraction time of the untreated samples was 20 h, 24 h and 24 h, respectively. The optimum extraction time of the pretreated samples was 16 h, 16 h and 12 h, respectively.

The mechanisms Underlying this bone-cardiovascular axis and biological links between bone and arterial abnormalities are suggestive of bone-vascular cross-talk. The nature of these links is not well understood and could result from 1) common factors acting on bone remodeling and arterial calcification; 2) compromised bone blood supply responsible for arteriosclerosis of bone vessels and reduced perfusion; and/or 3) direct action of bone cells (osteoblasts/osteocytes) on vascular biology and structure.

However, both TFs and ADRs did not always appear related to the presence of multiple pharmacologic treatments, a common status in subjects aged 65 and over. Instead, they seem more related to variations in the genes encoding protein metabolizing and transporting drugs. Thus, variations in these proteins may account for the inter-individual differences observed in drug efficacy, including the most severe clinical consequences TFs and ADRs. The genetics of drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and drug transporters (DTs) is a very active area of multidisciplinary research, overlapping the fields of medicine, biology, pharmacology, and genetics. These proteins are virtually responsible for metabolism and disposition, and thus the efficacy, of a number of drugs currently used in clinical practice. This article explored some basic concepts of the pharmacogenetics of DMEs and DTs. We also focused current knowledge of the genetic basis of TFs and ADRs of the most common drugs currently used in geriatric clinics. The knowledge of what we know and what we need to know is needed to advance the application of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice, in order to introduce personalized treatments for elderly people.

It displays an energy sensing mechanism, which permits enzyme activation under low cellular energy states. As GDH is at the crossroads of important metabolic pathways, a tight control of its activity is essential. Indeed, to fulfill its role in metabolism and cellular energetics. mammalian GDH has evolved into a highly regulated enzyme subject to allosteric modulation by diverse compounds. The recent emergence (<23 million years ago) in apes and humans of a hGDH2 isoenzyme with distinct regulatory properties, as well as, the detection of gain-of-function variants in hGDH1 and hGDH2 that affect the nervous system, have introduced additional complexities. The properties of the two highly homologous human GDHs were studied using purified recombinant hGDH1 and hGDH2 obtained by expression of the corresponding cDNAs in Sf21 cells. Results showed that, in contrast to hGDH1 that maintains substantial basal activity (35-40% of its maximal capacity), hGDH2 displays low basal activity (3-8% of maximal) that is remarkably responsive to activation by rising levels of ADP and/or L-leucine. This is primarily due to the Arg443Ser evolutionary change, which also made hGDH2 markedly sensitive to estrogens and neuroleptic drugs. In contrast to hGDH1, which is subject to potent GTP inhibition, hGDH2 has dissociated its function from this energy switch, being able to metabolize glutamate even when the Krebs cycle generates GTP levels sufficient to inactivate the housekeeping hGDH1. Our data also show that spermidine, a polyamine thought to reduce oxidative stress and to prolong survival, and EGCG, a green tea polyphenol, inhibit hGDH2 at lower concentrations than hGDH1. The implications of these findings in nerve tissue biology are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although numerous genes/proteins such as Oct4 and Gata6 have been identified to play critical regulatory roles in self-renewal and differentiation of hESC, the majority of the regulators in these cellular processes and more importantly how these regulators co-operate with each other and/or with epigenetic modifications are still largely unknown. We propose here a systematic approach to integrate genomic and epigenomic data for identification of direct regulatory interactions. This approach allows reconstruction of cell-type-specific transcription networks in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and fibroblasts at an unprecedented scale. Many links in the reconstructed networks coincide with known regulatory interactions or literature evidence. Systems-level analyses of these networks not only uncover novel regulators for pluripotency and differentiation, but also reveal extensive interplays between transcription factor binding and epigenetic modifications. Especially, we observed poised enhancers characterized by both active (H3K4me1) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks that contain enriched Oct4- and Suz12-binding sites. The success of such a systems biology approach is further supported by experimental validation of the predicted interactions.

Adaptations allow the organism to evade the host immune responses during acute infections and persist for an extended period of time during the latent infectious stage. In latently infected individuals, estimated to include one-third of the human population, the organism exists in a variety of metabolic states, which impedes the development of a simple strategy for controlling or eradicating this disease. Direct knowledge of the metabolic states of M. tuberculosis in patients would aid in the management of the disease as well as in forming the basis for developing new drugs and designing more efficacious drug cocktails. Here, we propose an in silico approach to create state-specific models based on readily available gene expression data. The coupling of differential gene expression data with a metabolic network model allowed us to characterize the metabolic adaptations of M. tuberculosis H37Rv to hypoxia. Given the microarray data for the alterations in gene expression, our model predicted reduced oxygen uptake, ATP production changes, and a global change from an oxidative to a reductive tricarboxylic acid (TCA) program. Alterations in the biomass composition indicated an increase in the cell wall metabolites required for cell-wall growth, as well as heightened accumulation of triacylglycerol in preparation for a low-nutrient, low metabolic activity life style. In contrast, the gene expression program in the deletion mutant of dosR, which encodes the immediate hypoxic response regulator, failed to adapt to low-oxygen stress. Our predictions were compatible with recent experimental observations of M. tuberculosis activity under hypoxic and anaerobic conditions. Importantly, alterations in the flow and accumulation of a particular metabolite were not necessarily directly linked to differential gene expression of the enzymes catalyzing the related metabolic reactions.

In the case of protein-protein interactions, an interaction can be inferred between two proteins on the basis that sequence-similar proteins have been observed to interact. The use of transferred interactions is common, but the legitimacy of such inferred interactions is not clear. Here we investigate transferred interactions and whether data incompleteness explains the lack of evidence found for them. Using definitions of homology associated with functional annotation transfer, we estimate that conservation rates of interactions are low even after taking interactome incompleteness into account. For example, at a blastp E-value threshold of 10(-70), we estimate the conservation rate to be about 11% between S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens. Our method also produces estimates of interactome sizes (which are similar to those previously proposed). Using our estimates of interaction conservation we estimate the rate at which protein-protein interactions are lost across species. To our knowledge, this is the first such study based on large-scale data. Previous work has suggested that interactions transferred within species are more reliable than interactions transferred across species. By controlling for factors that are specific to within-species interaction prediction, we propose that the transfer of interactions within species might be less reliable than transfers between species. Protein-protein interactions appear to be very rarely conserved unless very high sequence similarity is observed. Consequently, inferred interactions should be used with care.

To investigate the mechanistic basis of rippling behavior and its physiological role during predation by this Gram-negative soil bacterium, we have used an approach that combines mathematical modeling with experimental observations. Specifically, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate rippling behavior that employs a new signaling mechanism to trigger cellular reversals. The ABM has demonstrated that three ingredients are sufficient to generate rippling behavior: (i) side-to-side signaling between two cells that causes one of the cells to reverse, (ii) a minimal refractory time period after each reversal during which cells cannot reverse again, and (iii) physical interactions that cause the cells to locally align. To explain why rippling behavior appears as a consequence of the presence of prey, we postulate that prey-associated macromolecules indirectly induce ripples by stimulating side-to-side contact-mediated signaling. In parallel to the simulations, M. xanthus predatory rippling behavior was experimentally observed and analyzed using time-lapse microscopy. A formalized relationship between the wavelength, reversal time, and cell velocity has been predicted by the simulations and confirmed by the experimental data. Furthermore, the results suggest that the physiological role of rippling behavior during M. xanthus predation is to increase the rate of spreading over prey cells due to increased side-to-side contact-mediated signaling and to allow predatory cells to remain on the prey longer as a result of more periodic cell motility.

In endemic countries vivax malaria causes significant morbidity and its mortality is becoming more widely appreciated, drug-resistant strains are increasing in prevalence, and an increasing number of reports indicate that P. vivax is capable of breaking through the Duffy-negative barrier long considered to confer resistance to blood stage infection. Absence of robust in vitro propagation limits our understanding of fundamental aspects of the parasite's biology, including the determinants of its dormant hypnozoite phase, its virulence and drug susceptibility, and the molecular mechanisms underlying red blood cell invasion.Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report results from whole genome sequencing of five P. vivax isolates obtained from Malagasy and Cambodian patients, and of the monkey-adapted Belem strain. We obtained an average 70-400 X coverage of each genome, resulting in more than 93% of the Sal I reference sequence covered by 20 reads or more. Our study identifies more than 80,000 SNPs distributed throughout the genome which will allow designing association studies and population surveys. Analysis of the genome-wide genetic diversity in P. vivax also reveals considerable allele sharing among isolates from different continents. This observation could be consistent with a high level of gene flow among parasite strains distributed throughout the world.Conclusions: Our study shows that it is feasible to perform whole genome sequencing of P. vivax field isolates and rigorously characterize the genetic diversity of this parasite. The catalogue of polymorphisms generated here will enable large-scale genotyping studies and contribute to a better understanding of P. vivax traits such as drug resistance or erythrocyte invasion, partially circumventing the lack of laboratory culture that has hampered vivax research for years.

The photosensitizer ethyl eosin is associated with the polymersome membrane to oxidatively increase the hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic block under optical excitation. This optofluidic interaction induces rapid polymersome rupture and payload release via the reorganization of the aggregate structure into smaller diameter vesicles and micelles. When the particles are endocytosed by phagocytes, such as RAW macrophages and dendritic cells, the polymersomes' payload escapes the endosome and is released In the cell cytosol within a few seconds of illumination. The released payload is rapidly distributed throughout the cytosol within milliseconds. The presented optofluidic method enables fast delivery and distribution throughout the cytosol of individual cells, comparable to photochemical internalization, but a factor of 100 faster than similar carrier mediated delivery methods (e.g., liposomes, polymersomes, or nanoparticles). Due to the ability to simultaneously induce payload delivery and endosomal escape, this approach can find applications in detailed characterizations of intra- and intercellular processes.

Recurrent PCa is resistant to ADT. This research investigated whether PCa can potentially produce androgens tie novo, making them androgen self-sufficient. Steroidogenic enzymes required for androgen synthesis from cholesterol (CYP11A1, CYP17A1, HSD3 beta, HSD17 beta 3) were investigated in human primary PCa (n = 90), lymph node metastases (LNMs; n = 8), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; n = 6) with the use of IHC. Six prostate cell lines were investigated for mRNA and protein for steroidogenic enzymes and for endogenous synthesis of testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. All enzymes were identified in PCa, LNMs, BPH, and cell lines. CYP11A1 (rate-limiting enzyme) was expressed in cancerous and noncancerous prostate glands. CYP11A1, CYP17A1, HSD3 beta, and HSD17 beta 3 were identified, respectively, in 78%, 52%, 160/0, and 82% of human BPH and PCa samples. Approximately 10% of primary PCa, LNMs, and BPH expressed all four enzymes simultaneously. CYP11A1 expression was stable, CYP17A1 increased, and HSD3 beta and HSD17 beta 3 decreased with disease progression. CYP17A1 expression was significantly correlated with CYP11A1 (P = 0.0009), HSD3 beta (P = 0.0297), and HSD17 beta 3 (P = 0.0090) in vivo, suggesting CYP17A1 has a key role in prostatic steroidogenesis similar to testis and adrenal roles. In vitro, all cell lines expressed mRNA for all enzymes. Protein was not always detectable; however, all cell lines synthesized androgen from cholesterol. The results indicate that monitoring steroidogenic metabolites in patients with PCa may provide useful information for therapy intervention.

This study aimed to compare sigmoid mucosal microbiome of cirrhotic patients to controls, between HE vs. no-HE patients, and to study their linkage with cognition and inflammation. Sixty cirrhotic patients (36 HE and 24 no-HE) underwent cognitive testing, stool collection, cytokine (Th1, Th2, Th17, and innate immunity), and endotoxin analysis. Thirty-six patients (19 HE and 17 no-HE) and 17 age-matched controls underwent sigmoid biopsies. Multitag pyrosequencing (including autochthonous genera, i.e., Blautia, Roseburia, Fecalibacterium, Dorea) was performed on stool and mucosa. Stool and mucosal microbiome differences within/between groups and correlation network analyses were performed. Controls had significantly higher autochthonous and lower pathogenic genera compared with cirrhotic patients, especially HE patients. HE patients had worse MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score and cognition and higher IL-6 and endotoxin than no-HE. Mucosal microbiota was different from stool within both HE/no-HE groups. Between HE/no-HE patients, there was no difference in stool microbiota but mucosal microbiome was different with lower Roseburia and higher Enterococcus, Veillonella, Megasphaera, and Burkholderia abundance in HE. On network analysis, autochthonous genera (Blautia, Fecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Dorea) were associated with good cognition and decreased inflammation in both HE/no-HE, whereas genera overrepresented in HE (Enterococcus, Megasphaera, and Burkholderia) were linked to poor cognition and inflammation. Sigmoid mucosal microbiome differs significantly from stool microbiome in cirrhosis. Cirrhotic, especially HE, patients' mucosal microbiota is significantly different from controls with a lack of potentially beneficial autochthonous and overgrowth of potentially pathogenic genera, which are associated with poor cognition and inflammation.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection causes chronic gastritis and is the single most important risk factor for the development of gastric cancer in humans. Its vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) promotes gastric colonization and is associated with more severe disease. Acute exposure to VacA initially triggers host autophagy to mitigate the effects of the toxin in epithelial cells. Recently, we demonstrated that chronic exposure to VacA leads to the formation of defective autophagosomes that lack CTSD/cathepsin D and have reduced catalytic activity. Disrupted autophagy results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species and SQSTM1/p62 both in vitro and in vivo in biopsy samples from patients infected with VacA(+) but not VacA-strains. We also determined that the Crohn disease susceptibility polymorphism in the essential autophagy gene ATG16L1 increases susceptibility to H. pylori infection. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes from individuals with the ATG16L1 risk variant show impaired autophagic responses to VacA exposure. This is the first study to identify both a host autophagy susceptibility gene for H. pylori infection and to define the mechanism by which the autophagy pathway is affected following H. pylori infection. Collectively, these findings highlight the synergistic effects of host and bacterial autophagy factors on H. pylori pathogenesis and the potential for subsequent cancer susceptibility.

Review: The recruitment biology and ecology of large and Small crabgrass in turfgrass: Implications for management in the context of a cosmetic pesticide ban. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 829-845. Large and small crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis and Digitaria ischaemum, respectively) are problem weeds within turfgrass. As seedling recruitment shapes the demography of annual weeds, it is important to assess the recruitment biology and ecology of crabgrass species to determine how these aspects may be impacted by various management techniques. This, in addition to an assessment of large and small crabgrass' response to cultural management techniques in turfgrass, is the objective of this review. Turfgrass management either directly or indirectly affects the crabgrass recruitment microclimate by impacting the soil, topography, resources or plant cover, which in turn affects the degree and timing of crabgrass recruitment. Due to the increasing number and scale of cosmetic use pesticide bans in Canada this topic is particularly relevant. Crabgrass experiences a dormancy period of several weeks prior to being able to germinate. Microsite conditions of temperature and moisture have the greatest influence on dormancy breaking and germination; however, other factors such as light have shown some effect on recruitment. There is also evidence that factors such as seed scarification or treatment with nitrogenous compounds can increase recruitment. In turfgrass, common cultural practices, such as mowing, irrigation, and fertilization, can affect the recruitment of crabgrass. By pairing knowledge of the effects of microsite conditions on crabgrass recruitment with management that favours turfgrass vigour, better management practices to deter crabgrass infestation can be recommended. There are large gaps in research pertaining to the effects of cultural management techniques on crabgrass recruitment. Research to date has failed to make critical links between knowledge of these species' recruitment biology and ecology and how this is affected or can be applied through herbicide alternative management. This review recommends that regional assessments of crabgrass populations are necessary to determine the most appropriate management strategies. This type of research would have the potential to guide ideal application timings for existing and developing alternative herbicides as well as recommendations for the best cultural management practices to deter crabgrass infestation in turf.

In the existing methods of optimal control for PBNs, it is necessary to compute state transition diagrams with 2(n) nodes for a given PBN with n states. To avoid this computation, a polynomial optimization approach is proposed. In the proposed method, a PBN is transformed into a polynomial system, and the optimal control problem is reduced to a polynomial optimization problem. Since state transition diagrams are not computed, the proposed method is convenient for users.

Substrate with quenched fluorogenic molecule is incorporated in gel over which tissue sections are mounted and then incubated in buffer. The enzymatic activity is observed in the form of fluorescent signal. With the advancements in the field of biological research, use of in vitro cell culture has become very popular and holds great significance in multiple fields including inflammation, cancer, stem cell biology and the still emerging 3-D cell cultures. The information on analysis of enzymatic activity in cell lines is inadequate presently. We propose a single-step methodology that is simple, sensitive, cost-effective, and functional to perform and study the 'in position' activity of enzyme on substrate for in vitro cell cultures. Quantification of enzymatic activity to carry out comparative studies on cells has also been illustrated. This technique can be applied to a variety of enzyme classes including proteases, amylases, xylanases, and cellulases in cell cultures.

Mass production of these nematodes in liquid media has become a major challenge for commercialization. Producers are not willing to share the trade secrets of mass production and by doing so, have made culturing EPNs extremely difficult to advance existing technologies. Theoretically, mass production in liquid media is an ideal culturing method as it increases cost efficiency and nematode quantity. This paper will review current culturing methodologies and suggest basic culturing parameters for mass production. This review is focused on Heterorhabditis bacteriophora; however, this information can be useful for other nematode species.

Despite intense investigation, our understanding of the mechanisms leading to aneurysm development, progression and rupture remain incompletely defined. An accumulating body of evidence implicates inflammation as a critical contributor to aneurysm pathogenesis. Intracranial aneurysm formation and progression appear to result from endothelial dysfunction, a mounting inflammatory response, and vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation producing a pro-inflammatory phenotype. A later final common pathway appears to involve apoptosis of cellular constituents of the vessel wall. These changes result in degradation of the integrity of the vascular wall leading to aneurysmal dilation, progression and eventual rupture in certain aneurysms. Various aspects of the inflammatory response have been investigated as contributors to IA pathogenesis including leukocytes, complement, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and other humoral mediators. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of IA compared with control arteries has prominently featured differential expression of genes involved with immune response/inflammation. Preliminary data suggest that therapies targeting the inflammatory response may have efficacy in the future treatment of IA. Further investigation, however, is necessary to elucidate the precise role of inflammation in IA pathogenesis, which can be exploited to improve the prognosis of patients harboring IA.

In this study, we examined this process in detail, analyzing how hypoxia (8% O-2 for 14 days) alters the size distribution of vessels, number of arteries/arterioles, and expression pattern of endoglin (CD105), a marker of angiogenic endothelial cells in tumors. We found that cerebral hypoxia promoted the biggest increase in the number of medium to large size vessels, and this correlated with increased numbers of alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)-positive arterial vessels. Surprisingly, hypoxia induced a marked reduction in CD105 expression on brain endothelial cells (BECs) within remodeling arterial vessels, and these BECs also displayed an angiogenic switch in beta 1 integrins (from alpha 6 to alpha 5), previously described for developmental angiogenesis. In vitro, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 also promoted this switch of BEC beta 1 integrins. Together, these results show that cerebral hypoxia promotes arteriogenesis, and identify reduced CD105 expression as a novel marker of arteriogenesis. Furthermore, our data suggest a mechanistic model whereby BECs in remodeling arterial vessels downregulate CD105 expression, which alters TGF-beta 1 signaling, to promote a switch in beta 1 integrins and arteriogenic remodeling.

Marked inter-animal variability in central nervous system (CNS) toxicity was identified following administration of a high dose of INH, which enabled characterization of CNS responders and CNS non-responders. High-resolution post-dose urinary H-1 NMR spectra were modeled both by their xenobiotic and endogenous metabolic information sets, enabling simultaneous identification of the differential metabolic fate of INH and its associated endogenous metabolic consequences in CNS responders and CNS non-responders. A characteristic xenobiotic metabolic profile was observed for CNS responders, which revealed higher urinary levels of pyuvate isonicotinylhydrazone and beta-glucosyl isonicotinylhydrazide and lower levels of acetylisoniazid compared to CNS non-responders. This suggested that the capacity for acetylation of INH was lower in CNS responders, leading to increased metabolism via conjugation with pyruvate and glucose. In addition, the endogenous metabolic profile of CNS responders revealed higher urinary levels of lactate and glucose, in comparison to CNS non-responders. Pharmacometabonomic analysis of the pre-dose H-1 NMR urinary spectra identified a metabolic signature that correlated with the development of INH-induced adverse CNS effects and may represent a means of predicting adverse events and acetylation capacity when challenged with high dose INH. Given the widespread use of INH for the treatment of tuberculosis, this pharmacometabonomic screening approach may have translational potential for patient stratification to minimize adverse events.

From recent advances in this discipline, a picture has emerged of intimate and specific interactions between lipids and proteins that has driven renewed interest in the structure of lipids themselves and raised intriguing questions as to the specificity and stoichiometry in lipid-protein complexes. Herein we demonstrate some of the limitations of crystallography in resolving critical structural features of ligated lipids and thus determining how these motifs impact protein binding. As a consequence, mass spectrometry must play an important and complementary role in unraveling the complexities of lipid-protein interactions. We evaluate recent advances and highlight ongoing challenges towards the twin goals of (1) complete structure elucidation of low, abundant, and structurally diverse lipids by mass spectrometry alone, and (2) assignment of stoichiometry and specificity of lipid interactions within protein complexes.

Some nutrients, such as CO2 and NH3, are readily diffusible across the cell membrane. The large membrane permeability of these nutrients obviates the need of transporters when the ambient level is high. When the ambient level is low, however, maintaining a high intracellular nutrient level against passive back diffusion is both challenging and costly. Here, we study the delicate management of ammonium (NH4+/NH3) sequestration by E. coli cells using microfluidic chemostats. We find that as the ambient ammonium concentration is reduced, E. coli cells first maximize their ability to assimilate the gaseous NH3 diffusing into the cytoplasm and then abruptly activate ammonium transport. The onset of transport varies under different growth conditions, but always occurring just as needed to maintain growth. Quantitative modeling of known interactions reveals an integral feedback mechanism by which this need-based uptake strategy is implemented. This novel strategy ensures that the expensive cost of upholding the internal ammonium concentration against back diffusion is kept at a minimum.

At this rate, simple models of diffusion lead to the expectation that LacI and other proteins will rapidly homogenize throughout the cell. Here, we test this expectation of spatial homogeneity by single-molecule visualization of LacI molecules non-specifically bound to DNA in fixed cells. Contrary to expectation, we find that the distribution depends on the spatial location of its encoding gene. We demonstrate that the spatial distribution of LacI is also determined by the local state of DNA compaction, and that E. coli can dynamically redistribute proteins by modifying the state of its nucleoid. Finally, we show that LacI inhomogeneity increases the strength with which targets located proximally to the LacI gene are regulated. We propose a model for intranucleoid diffusion that can reconcile these results with previous measurements of LacI diffusion, and we discuss the implications of these findings for gene regulation in bacteria and eukaryotes.

We created human trisomic and tetrasomic cell lines and determined the quantitative changes in their transcriptome and proteome in comparison with their diploid counterparts. We found that whereas transcription levels reflect the chromosome copy number changes, the abundance of some proteins, such as subunits of protein complexes and protein kinases, is reduced toward diploid levels. Furthermore, using the quantitative data we investigated the changes of cellular pathways in response to aneuploidy. This analysis revealed specific and uniform alterations in pathway regulation in cells with extra chromosomes. For example, the DNA and RNA metabolism pathways were downregulated, whereas several pathways such as energy metabolism, membrane metabolism and lysosomal pathways were upregulated. In particular, we found that the p62-dependent selective autophagy is activated in the human trisomic and tetrasomic cells. Our data present the first broad proteomic analysis of human cells with abnormal karyotypes and suggest a uniform cellular response to the presence of an extra chromosome.

Here, we have used a metabolomics approach to identify candidate biomarkers of pre-diabetes. We quantified 140 metabolites for 4297 fasting serum samples in the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) cohort. Our study revealed significant metabolic variation in pre-diabetic individuals that are distinct from known diabetes risk indicators, such as glycosylated hemoglobin levels, fasting glucose and insulin. We identified three metabolites (glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (18:2) and acetylcarnitine) that had significantly altered levels in IGT individuals as compared to those with normal glucose tolerance, with P-values ranging from 2.4 x 10(-4) to 2.1 x 10(-13). Lower levels of glycine and LPC were found to be predictors not only for IGT but also for T2D, and were independently confirmed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam cohort. Using metabolite-protein network analysis, we identified seven T2D-related genes that are associated with these three IGT-specific metabolites by multiple interactions with four enzymes. The expression levels of these enzymes correlate with changes in the metabolite concentrations linked to diabetes. Our results may help developing novel strategies to prevent T2D.

However, many morphogens, including Hedgehog, create opposing activator and repressor gradients (OARGs). In contrast to single activator gradients, it is not well understood how OARGs control transcriptional patterns. We present a general thermodynamic model that explains how spatial patterns of gene expression are established within OARGs. The model predicts that differences in enhancer binding site affinities for morphogen-responsive transcription factors (TFs) produce discrete transcriptional boundaries, but only when either activators or repressors bind cooperatively. This model quantitatively predicts the boundaries of gene expression within OARGs. When trained on experimental data, our model accounts for the counterintuitive observation that increasing the affinity of binding sites in enhancers of Hedgehog target genes produces more restricted transcription within Hedgehog gradients in Drosophila. Because our model is general, it may explain the role of low-affinity binding sites in many contexts, including mammalian Hedgehog gradients.

Tumor cells exhibit extensive alterations in the cell-surface and nuclear proteomes. Functionally similar changes in the proteome were observed comparing rapidly growing and differentiated CaCo-2 cells. In contrast, there was minimal proteomic remodeling between primary cancer and metastases, suggesting that no drastic proteome changes are necessary for the tumor to propagate in a different tissue context. Additionally, we introduce a new way to determine protein copy numbers per cell without protein standards. Copy numbers estimated in enterocytes and cancer cells are in good agreement with CaCo-2 and HeLa cells and with the literature data.

However, stochastic effects such as local fluctuations in morphogen concentration and noise in signal transduction make it difficult for cells to respond to their positions accurately enough to generate sharp boundaries between gene expression domains. During development of rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) induces expression of hoxb1a in rhombomere 4 (r4) and krox20 in r3 and r5. Fluorescent in situ hybridization reveals rough edges around these gene expression domains, in which cells co-express hoxb1a and krox20 on either side of the boundary, and these sharpen within a few hours. Computational analysis of spatial stochastic models shows, surprisingly, that noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression actually promotes sharpening of boundaries between adjacent segments. In particular, fluctuations in RA initially induce a rough boundary that requires noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression to sharpen. This finding suggests a novel noise attenuation mechanism that relies on intracellular noise to induce switching and coordinate cellular decisions during developmental patterning.

A crucial event in apoptosis is the formation of protein-permeable pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane that release cytochrome c and other apoptosis-promoting factors into the cytosol. Research efforts over the past two decades have established that apoptotic pores require BCL-2 family proteins, with the proapoptotic BAX-type proteins being direct effectors of pore formation. Accumulating evidence indicates that other cellular components also cooperate with BCL-2 family members to regulate the apoptotic pore. Despite this knowledge, the molecular pathway leading to apoptotic pore formation at the outer mitochondrial membrane and the precise nature of this outer membrane pore remain enigmatic. In this issue of PLOS Biology, Kushnareva and colleagues describe a novel kinetic analysis of the dynamics of BAX-dependent apoptotic pore formation recapitulated in native mitochondrial outer membranes. Their study reveals the existence of a hitherto unknown outer mitochondrial membrane factor that is critical for BAX-mediated apoptotic pore formation, and challenges the currently popular view that the apoptotic pore is a purely proteinaceous multimeric assembly of BAX proteins.

Side-chain specific isotopic labeling is a general approach towards obtaining such assignments. We report a method for high yield isotope editing of the bacterial blue light sensor photoactive yellow protein (PYP) containing ring-D-4-Tyr. PYP was heterologously overproduced in Escherichia coli in minimal media containing ring-D-4-Tyr in the presence of glyphosate, which inhibits endogenous biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (Phe, Trp, and Tyr). Mass spectrometry of the intact protein and of tryptic peptides unambiguously demonstrated highly specific labeling of all five Tyr residues in PYP with 98% incorporation and undetectable isotopic scrambling. FTIR spectroscopy of the protein reveals a characteristic Tyr ring vibrational mode at 1515 cm(-1) that is shifted to 1436 cm(-1), consistent with that from ab initio calculations.

Herein we review currently applied tools in ecological risk assessment, combining information on exposure with expected biological effects or environmental water quality standards; currently applied effect-based tools are presented based on whether exposure occurs in a controlled laboratory environment or in the field. With increasing ecological relevance the reproducibility, specificity and thus suitability for standardisation of methods tends to diminish. We discuss the use of biomarkers in ecotoxicology including ecotoxicogenomics-based endpoints, which are becoming increasingly important for the detection of sublethal effects. Carefully selected sets of biomarkers allow an assessment of exposure to and effects of toxic chemicals, as well as the health status of organisms and, when combined with chemical analysis, identification of toxicant(s). The promising concept of ""adverse outcome pathways (AOP)"" links mechanistic responses on the cellular level with whole organism, population, community and potentially ecosystem effects and services. For most toxic mechanisms, however, practical application of AOPs will require more information and the identification of key links between responses, as well as key indicators, at different levels of biological organization, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services.

Shortly thereafter, the ARE was shown to function as a regulator of mRNA degradation, and AREs were later shown to regulate other posttranscriptional mechanisms such as translation and mRNA localization. AREs coordinately regulate networks of chemokine, cytokine, and growth regulatory transcripts involved in cellular activation, proliferation, and inflammation. ARE-mediated regulation is carried out by a host of ARE-binding proteins, whose activity is regulated in a cell type and activation-dependent manner. The last 25 years of ARE research has offered insight into the mechanisms and regulation of ARE-mediated mRNA decay, and has provided a road map for the discovery of additional mRNA regulatory motifs. The future of ARE research will transition from a discovery phase to a phase focused on translating basic biological findings into novel therapeutic targets. Our understanding of ARE-mediated gene regulation and posttranscriptional control has implications for many fields of study including developmental biology, neuroscience, immunobiology, and cancer biology.

Although few wild populations remain, more than 700,000 C. siamensis are held on commercial crocodile farms in Southeast Asia. Despite conservation concerns, many aspects of C. siamensis life history remain poorly known, particularly with regards to its reproductive biology. We studied nesting phenology, clutch characteristics, and other aspects of C. siamensis reproductive biology on crocodile farms in Cambodia during 2000 and 2001. Oviposition among captive crocodiles began in February and continued into early June. The mean (+/- 1 SD) oviposition date based on pooled data from 2000 and 2001 was 5 April +/- 24 days. Mean oviposition date differed significantly between 2000 and 2001, possibly as a result of annual variability among nesting cues. The mean incubation period was 72 +/- 3 days and eggs hatched from 5 May to 18 August. Mean clutch size (25.0 +/- 8.8 eggs; n = 183) differed significantly between years, possibly resulting from the >2.5-fold increase in sample size during 2001. There was no correlation between clutch size and oviposition date during either 2000 or 2001. A single female produced two clutches during 2001, complimenting previous reports of double-clutching among C. siamensis. The mean length and width of 515 eggs were 78.2 +/- 4.9 and 48.1 +/- 2.5?mm, respectively; mean egg mass was 90.8 +/- 16.5?g (n = 471). One unpipped egg contained a set of twins.

Unfortunately, studying the underlying biology of GPI-anchor synthesis is difficult, especially in medically relevant fungal pathogens because they are not genetically tractable. Compounding difficulties, many of the genes in this pathway are essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we report the discovery of a new small molecule christened gepinacin (for GPI acylation inhibitor) which selectively inhibits Gwt1, a critical acyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of fungal GPI anchors. After delineating the target specificity of gepinacin using genetic and biochemical techniques, we used it to probe key, therapeutically relevant consequences of disrupting GPI anchor metabolism in fungi. We found that, unlike all three major classes of antifungals in current use, the direct antimicrobial activity of this compound results predominantly from its ability to induce overwhelming stress to the endoplasmic reticulum. Gepinacin did not affect the viability of mammalian cells nor did it inhibit their orthologous acyltransferase. This enabled its use in co-culture experiments to examine Gwt1's effects on host-pathogen interactions. In isolates of Candida albicans, the most common fungal pathogen in humans, exposure to gepinacin at sublethal concentrations impaired filamentation and unmasked cell wall beta-glucan to stimulate a pro-inflammatory cytokine response in macrophages. Gwt1 is a promising antifungal drug target, and gepanacin is a useful probe for studying how disrupting GPI-anchor synthesis impairs viability and alters host-pathogen interactions in genetically intractable fungi.

These responses are governed by cellular networks, which serve to process diverse environmental cues. Biological networks often contain recurring network topologies called ""motifs"". It has been recognized that the study of such motifs allows one to predict the response of a biological network and thus cellular behavior. However, studying a single motif in complete isolation of all other network motifs in a natural setting is difficult. Synthetic biology has emerged as a powerful approach to understanding the dynamic properties of network motifs. In addition to testing existing theoretical predictions, construction and analysis of synthetic gene circuits has led to the discovery of novel motif dynamics, such as how the combination of simple motifs can lead to autonomous dynamics or how noise in transcription and translation can affect the dynamics of a motif. Here, we review developments in synthetic biology as they pertain to increasing our understanding of cellular information processing. We highlight several types of dynamic behaviors that diverse motifs can generate, including the control of input/output responses, the generation of autonomous spatial and temporal dynamics, as well as the influence of noise in motif dynamics and cellular behavior.

Using a cell-free transcription-translation system as a molecular programming platform, we show that the bacteriophage T7, encoded by a 40 kbp DNA program composed of about 60 genes, can be entirely synthesized from its genomic DNA in a test tube reaction. More than a billion infectious bacteriophages T7 per milliliter of reaction are produced after a few hours of incubation. The replication of the genomic DNA occurs concurrently with phage gene expression, protein synthesis, and viral assembly. The demonstration that genome-sized viral.

", Biochemical Research Methods 10.1021/sb300040v,Evolutionary Stability of a Refactored Phage Genome,"Abstract: Engineered genetic systems are commonly unstable; if propagated, they evolve to reverse or modify engineered elements because the elements impair fitness. A goal of synthetic biology is thus to anticipate and avoid detrimental engineering, but little is yet known about which types of elements cause problems in different contexts. In prior work, 30% of the genome of bacteriophage T7 was ""refactored"" by the insertion or modification of 65 short sequences that included a useful restriction enzyme site in order to, among other goals, separate genes and their translational initiation regions from each other and from other genetic elements. Although gene sequences and known important regions of regulatory elements were kept intact, the translational efficiency of some genes or element regulatory function might have been compromised. We adapted the refactored phage for rapid growth in two conditions, observing fitness and sequence evolution. As anticipated from the original work, refactoring had major fitness effects in both environments, but most of the fitness costs were recovered upon adaptation. The evolved phages retained 60-70% of the design elements, suggesting they had only minor fitness effects. Approximately half the elements that were lost lie within large deletions commonly observed during adaptation of the wild-type genome. Some elements were lost or modified in parallel between the adaptations without affecting T7 gene sequences, but no obvious correlates can be made. Nevertheless, experimental adaptations are useful for identifying specific synthetic design problems, and we suggest that experimental evolution in conjunction with alternative engineering may also be useful in overcoming those problems.

Although osteoinductive growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins have entered clinics, transplantation of autologous bone remains the gold standard to treat bone defects. The effective treatment of bone defects by protein therapeutics in humans requires quantities that exceed the physiological doses by several orders of magnitude. This not only results in very high treatment costs but also bears considerable risks for adverse side effects. These issues have motivated the development of biomaterials technologies allowing to better control biomolecule delivery from the solid phase. Here we review recent approaches to immobilize biomolecules by affinity binding or by covalent grafting to biomaterial matrices. We focus on biomaterials concepts that are inspired by extracellular matrix (ECM) biology and in particular the dynamic interaction of growth factors with the ECM. We highlight the value of synthetic, ECM-mimicking matrices for future technologies to study bone biology and develop the next generation of 'smart' implants. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First published July 13, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00389.2011.-Transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) are widely expressed and regulate Ca2+ entry in the cells that participate in the pathophysiology of airway hyperreactivity, inflammation, and remodeling. In vitro studies point to a role for TRPC1-mediated Ca2+ signaling in several of these cell types; however, physiological evidence is lacking. Here we identify TRPC1 signaling as proinflammatory and a regulator of lung hyperresponsiveness during allergen-induced pulmonary response. TRPC1-deficient (Trpc1(-/-)) mice are hyposensitive to methacholine challenge and have significantly reduced allergen-induced pulmonary leukocyte infiltration coupled with an attenuated T helper type 2 (Th2) cell response. Upon in vitro allergen exposure, Trpc1(-/-) splenocytes show impaired proliferation and T cell receptor-induced IL-2 production. A high number of germinal centers in spleens of Trpc1(-/-) mice and elevated levels of immunoglobulins in their serum are indicative of dysregulated B cell function and homeostasis. Thus we propose that TRPC1 signaling is necessary in lymphocyte biology and in regulation of allergen-induced lung hyperresponsiveness, making TRPC1 a potential target for treatment of immune diseases and asthma.

Antibiotic resistance genes are often transferred between bacteria by mobile genetic vectors called plasmids. It is commonly believed that removal of antibiotic pressure will reduce the numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to the perception that carriage of resistance imposes a fitness cost on the bacterium. This study investigated the ability of the plasmid pCT, a globally distributed plasmid that carries an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) resistance gene (bla(CTX-M-14)), to persist and dis-seminate in the absence of antibiotic pressure. We investigated key attributes in plasmid success, including conjugation frequencies, bacterial-host growth rates, ability to cause infection, and impact on the fitness of host strains. We also determined the contribution of the bla(CTX-M-14) gene itself to the biology of the plasmid and host bacterium. Carriage of pCT was found to impose no detectable fitness cost on various bacterial hosts. An absence of antibiotic pressure and inactivation of the antibiotic resistance gene also had no effect on plasmid persistence, conjugation frequency, or bacterial-host biology. In conclusion, plasmids such as pCT have evolved to impose little impact on host strains. Therefore, the persistence of antibiotic resistance genes and their vectors is to be expected in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure regardless of antibiotic stewardship. Other means to reduce plasmid stability are needed to prevent the persistence of these vectors and the antibiotic resistance genes they carry.

RANKL/OPG ratio reported in favour of OPG gene expression and alkaline phosphatase gene expression increased in osteoblasts exposed to the two lower doses of the eicosanoid after 15 days. Conversely, prostaglandin E synthase, a cytokine produced during PGE(2) synthesis, gene expression was significantly reduced at 15 and 20 days (p < 0.01 and 0.05 respectively). The results from this study add to the current knowledge of the mechanisms by which PGE2 modulates the osteoblast biology in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusions: It is proposed that PGE(2)at a low dose switch osteoblast's biology in favour of bone apposition by: first, inducing a significantly higher OPG gene expression overwhelming RANKL gene expression; second, reducing PGEs synthesis; and third, increasing ALP gene expression. An opposite effect is expected when the concentration of the eicosanoid overpass certain levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The supernatant was collected and analyzed for the expression of cytokines in a panel array, ALP using a commercial kit and NO2- with Griess reaction method. Also, the cells were analyzed using Western blot for RANKL and slot blotting for nitrotyrosine expression.Result: There were no significant differences amongst the groups in terms of NO2-, protein nitrotyrosine content and RANKL expression. However, all stimuli increased ALP activity and in case of PRP, it was in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.001). Also, all stimuli induced an increase in cytokines and chemokines expression, but only PRP promoted an increase of component C5, sICAM-1 and RANTES expression. Whilst IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) expression was down-regulated by PRP, both LPS and IL-1 beta caused up-regulation of this cytokine.Conclusions: PRP can stimulate osteoblast activity and cytokine/chemokine release, as well as indicate some of the mediators that can (and cannot) be involved in this activation.

Students preparing for careers in science, technology, and medicine need more intensive study of bioinformatics and more sophisticated training in the mathematics on which this field is based. In this study, we deliberately integrated bioinformatics instruction at multiple course levels into an existing biology curriculum. Students in an introductory biology course, intermediate lab courses, and advanced project-oriented courses all participated in new course components designed to sequentially introduce bioinformatics skills and knowledge, as well as computational approaches that are common to many bioinformatics applications. In each course, bioinformatics learning was embedded in an existing disciplinary instructional sequence, as opposed to having a single course where all bioinformatics learning occurs. We designed direct and indirect assessment tools to follow student progress through the course sequence. Our data show significant gains in both student confidence and ability in bioinformatics during individual courses and as course level increases. Despite evidence of substantial student learning in both bioinformatics and mathematics, students were skeptical about the link between learning bioinformatics and learning mathematics. While our approach resulted in substantial learning gains, student buy-in and engagement might be better in longer project-based activities that demand application of skills to research problems.

Predation could be an important determinant of the structure of these communities, but the research to date suggests a predation paradox: Vertebrate predator numbers increase with urbanization, whereas predation rates decline. We reviewed studies on predator abundance and the survival of terrestrial vertebrates in urban and nonurban contexts to evaluate whether the predation paradox is a widespread phenomenon. We conclude that there is substantial support for it. We discuss hypotheses to explain the paradox and suggest that urbanization has fundamentally altered trophic dynamics by reducing top-down control through multiple mechanisms and by increasing bottom-up forcing through the greater availability of anthropogenic foods. The hypotheses are summarized in a conceptual model that generates testable predictions designed to advance our understanding of trophic dynamics in metropolitan areas.

Also important, this improved understanding of immunotherapy and the mechanisms underlying immunity in cancer has fueled an expanding array of new therapeutic agents for a variety of cancers. Pegylated interferon-a2b as an adjuvant therapy and ipilimumab as therapy for advanced disease, both of which were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for melanoma in March 2011, are 2 prime examples of how an increased understanding of the principles of tumor biology and immunology have been translated successfully from the laboratory to the clinical setting.

The most common T-cell entities include peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative, which account for approximately 60% of T-cell lymphoma cases. Because of the rarity of T-cell lymphomas and lack of randomized prospective studies, treatment for these diseases is not well defined.

It is usually a progressive disorder that virtually always involves the lung and characteristically presents as bilateral pulmonary nodules. Other commonly affected organ systems include the skin, central nervous system, and kidneys. The rareness of LYG in conjunction with its nonspecific presentation contributes to delays in diagnosis in many situations. Pathologically, it is characterized by the presence of an angiocentric and angiodestructive accumulation of varying numbers of T cells with varying numbers of atypical clonal EBV-positive B cells in a polymorphous inflammatory background. It can be subclassified using a grading system based on the number of EBV-positive large B-cell malignant cells, which is critical in selecting appropriate management strategies. Lower-grade LYG occasionally undergoes spontaneous remission and is best managed with strategies designed to enhance the host's underlying immune system, whereas high-grade LYG is best managed by combination chemoimmunotherapy but has inferior outcomes. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis can lead to progressive pulmonary failure, central nervous system disease, or progression to overt EBV-positive lymphoma without appropriate recognition and management. Improvements in the modern understanding of the biology of LYG, particularly the precise role of EBV in its pathogenesis, offer promise in the development of improved management strategies.

In chronic kidney disease, hyperphosphatemia has emerged as a risk factor for vascular calcification, cardiovascular mortality, left ventricular hypertrophy, and progression of chronic kidney disease. Serum phosphate at the upper limits of normal has also been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with relatively preserved kidney function. Of note, hyperphosphatemia is not a sensitive indicator of phosphate overload. In this regard, increased circulating fibroblast growth factor-23, a phosphatonin that is released in response to phosphate overload, is independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients with and without chronic kidney disease. Direct effects of extracellular phosphate on vascular calcification or cardiovascular cell biology; adverse consequences of adaptive mechanisms activated to limit phosphate overload, such as left ventricular hypertrophy induced by fibroblast growth factor-23; or epidemiological associations of additional cardiovascular risk factors with chronic kidney disease may underlie these observations. We now review the pathophysiology of phosphate, its relationship with cardiovascular outcomes, the potential consequences for patient care related to dietary phosphate and phosphate binders, and the clinical relevance for patients without overt chronic kidney disease.

The acute phase is manifested by a non-fatal febrile illness, polyarthralgia and maculopapular rashes in adults, but with recurrent arthralgia that may linger for months during convalescence. The issue of cellular and tissue tropism of CHIKV has elicited interest primarily because of this lingering incapacitating chronic joint pain, as well as clear encephalopathy in severe cases among neonates during the re-emergence of the virus in recent epidemics. The principle cell types productively infected by CHIKV are skin fibroblasts, epithelial cells and lymphoid tissues. There is controversy as to whether CHIKV productively infects haematopoietic cells and neurones/glia. CHIKV infection triggers rapid and robust innate immune responses which quickly clears the acute phase infection. However, significant acute as well as chronic infection of less obvious cell types, such as monocytes, neurones/glia or even CNS neural progenitors may conceivably occur. There is therefore a need to ascertain the full range potential of CHIKV tropism, fully understand the cellular responses triggered during the acute the convalescent phases, and explore possible cell types that might be the source of chronic problems associated with CHIKV infection.

The reaction of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and one-electron oxidants with cytosine derivatives produces numerous oxidation products, which have been identified in large part by model studies with monomer's and short oligonucleotides. Here, we developed an analytical method based on LC-MS/MS to detect 10 oxidized bases in DNA, including 5 oxidation products of cytosine. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the measurement of base damage in isolated calf thymus DNA exposed to ionizing radiation in aerated aqueous solutions (0-200 Gy) and to well-known Fenton-like reactions (Fe2+ or Cu+ with H2O2 and ascorbate). The following cytosine modifications were quantified as modified 2'-deoxyribonucleosides upon exposure of DNA to ionizing radiation in aqueous aerated solution: 5-hydroxyhydantoin (Hyd-Ura) > 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHUra) > 5-hydroxycytosine (5-OHCyt) > 5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrouracil (Ura-Gly) > 1-carbamoyl-4,5-dihydroxy-2-oxoimidazolidine (Imid-Cyt). The total yield of cytosine oxidation products was comparable to that of thymine oxidation products (5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine (Thy-Gly), 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantotin (Hyd-Thy), 5(hydroxymethyl)uracil (5-HmUra), and 5-formyluracil (5-ForUra)) as well as the yield of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua). The major oxidation product of cytosine in DNA was Hyd-Ura. In contrast, the formation of Imid-Cyt was a minor pathway of DNA damage, although it is the major product arising from irradiation of the monomers, cytosine, and 2'-deoxycytidine. The reaction of Fenton-like reagents with DNA gave a different distribution of cytosine derived products compared to ionizing radiation, which likely reflects the reaction of metal ions with intermediate peroxyl radicals or hydroperoxides. The analysis of the main cytosine oxidation products will help elucidate the complex mechanism of oxidative degradation of cytosine in DNA and probe the consequences of these reactions in biology and medicine.

In this work, we have established the siderophore profile of S. putrefaciens in cultures augmented with the native PB precursor putrescine and in putrescine-depleted cultures. Compared to base medium, PB increased by two-fold in cultures of S. putrefaciens with 10 mM NaCl and 20 mM exogenous putrescine. In cultures augmented with 1,4-diaminobutan-2-one (DAB), PB decreased with only 0.02-fold PB detectable at 10 mM DAB. As an ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) inhibitor, DAB depleted levels of endogenous putrescine which attenuated downstream PB assembly. Under putrescine-depleted conditions, S. putrefaciens produced as its replacement siderophore the cadaverine-based desferrioxamine B (DFO-B), as characterised by ESI-MS of the FeIII-loaded form (m/zobs 614.13; m/zcalc 614.27). A third siderophore, independent of DAB, was observed in low levels. LC/MS Analysis of the FeIII-loaded extract gave m/zobs 440.93, which, formulated as a 1?:?1 FeIII complex with a macrocyclic dihydroxamic acid, comprising one putrescine- and one cadaverine-based precursor (m/zcalc 440.14). These results show that the production of native PB or non-native DFO-B by S. putrefaciens can be directed though upstream inhibition of ODC. This approach could be used to increase the molecular diversity of siderophores produced by S. putrefaciens and to map alternative diamine-dependent metabolites.

Within pancreatic b cells, every T1D autoantigen is in one way or another linked to the secretory pathway. Together, these autoantigens play diverse roles in glucose regulation, metabolism of biogenic amines, as well as the regulation, formation, and packaging of secretory granules. The mechanism(s) by which immune tolerance to islet-cell antigens is lost during the development of T1D, remains unclear. Antigenic peptide creation for immune presentation may potentially link to the secretory biology of b cells in a number of ways, including proteasomal digestion of misfolded products, exocytosis and endocytosis of cell-surface products, or antigen release from dying b cells during normal or pathological turnover. In this context, we evaluate the biochemical nature and immunogenicity of the major autoantigens in T1D including (pro) insulin, GAD65, ZnT8, IA2, and ICA69.

The disease is marked by mucus hyperproduction and plugging in many organs, which are usually most fatal in the airways of CF patients, once the problem of meconium ileus at birth is resolved. After the CF gene, CFTR, was cloned and its protein product identified as a cAMP-regulated Cl- channel, causal mechanisms underlying the strong mucus phenotype of the disease became obscure. Here we focus on mucin genes and polymeric mucin glycoproteins, examining their regulation and potential relationships to a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Detailed examination of CFTR expression in organs and different cell types indicates that changes in CFTR expression do not always correlate with the severity of CF disease or mucus accumulation. Thus, the mucus hyperproduction that typifies CF does not appear to be a direct cause of a defective CFTR but, rather, to be a downstream consequence. In organs like the lung, up-regulation of mucin gene expression by inflammation results from chronic infection; however, in other instances and organs, the inflammation may have a non-infectious origin. The mucus plugging phenotype of the beta-subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel (beta ENaC)-overexpressing mouse is proving to be an archetypal example of this kind of inflammation, with a dehydrated airway surface/concentrated mucus gel apparently providing the inflammatory stimulus. Data indicate that the luminal HCO3- deficiency recently described for CF epithelia may also provide such a stimulus, perhaps by causing a mal-maturation of mucins as they are released onto luminal surfaces. In any event, the path between CFTR dysfunction and mucus hyperproduction has proven tortuous, and its unraveling continues to offer its own twists and turns, along with fascinating glimpses into biology.

Adipose tissue not only provides energy for growth, reproduction and immune function, but also secretes and receives diverse signaling molecules that coordinate energy allocation between these functions in response to ecological conditions. Importantly, many relevant ecological cues act on growth and physique, with adiposity responding as a counterbalancing risk management strategy. The large number of individual alleles associated with adipose tissue illustrates its integration with diverse metabolic pathways. However, phenotypic variation in age, sex, ethnicity and social status is further associated with different strategies for storing and using energy. Adiposity therefore represents a key means of phenotypic flexibility within and across generations, enabling a coherent life-history strategy in the face of ecological stochasticity. The sensitivity of numerous metabolic pathways to ecological cues makes our species vulnerable to manipulative globalized economic forces. The aim of this article is to understand how human adipose tissue biology interacts with modern environmental pressures to generate excess weight gain and obesity. The disease component of obesity might lie not in adipose tissue itself, but in its perturbation by our modern industrialized niche. Efforts to combat obesity could be more effective if they prioritized 'external' environmental change rather than attempting to manipulate 'internal' biology through pharmaceutical or behavioral means.

More than 50 years ago, Otto G. Edholm proposed that ""the differences between the intakes of food [of individuals] must originate in differences in the expenditure of energy"". However, a relationship between energy expenditure and energy intake within any one day could not be found, although there was a correlation over 2 weeks. This issue was never resolved before interest in integrative biology was replaced by molecular biochemistry. Using a psychobiological approach, we have studied appetite control in an energy balance framework using a multi-level experimental system on a single cohort of overweight and obese human subjects. This has disclosed relationships between variables in the domains of body composition [fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM)], metabolism, gastrointestinal hormones, hunger and energy intake. In this Commentary, we review our own and other data, and discuss a new formulation whereby appetite control and energy intake are regulated by energy expenditure. Specifically, we propose that FFM (the largest contributor to resting metabolic rate), but not body mass index or FM, is closely associated with self-determined meal size and daily energy intake. This formulation has implications for understanding weight regulation and the management of obesity.

Such similarities do not necessarily demonstrate causal links, but instead suggest that specific causes of and metabolic disturbances associated with obesity play a pathogenic role in the development of co-morbid disorders, potentially even before obesity develops. Metabolomics - the systematic study of metabolites, which are small molecules generated by the process of metabolism - has been important in elucidating the pathways underlying obesity-associated co-morbidities. This review covers how recent metabolomic studies have advanced biomarker discovery and the elucidation of mechanisms underlying obesity and its co-morbidities, with a specific focus on metabolic syndrome and psychotic disorders. The importance of identifying metabolic markers of disease-associated intermediate phenotypes - traits modulated but not encoded by the DNA sequence - is emphasized. Such markers would be applicable as diagnostic tools in a personalized healthcare setting and might also open up novel therapeutic avenues.

The DBDs confer gene target site specificity, whereas LBDs serve as control switches for NHR function. For many NHRs, both endogenous and synthetic small molecule ligands bind to small pockets within the LBDs, resulting in conformational changes that regulate transcriptional activity. This property of NHRs has been exploited by the pharmaceutical industry for therapeutic targeting of a wide variety of diseases, ranging from inflammatory diseases and cancer to endocrine and metabolic diseases. Th17 cells are CD4+ T helper effector cells that express several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A, and the actions of these cells have been linked to multiple human autoimmune diseases. Our laboratory previously identified the NHR ROR?t, an immune cell-specific isoform of ROR? (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma), as a key transcription factor for the development of Th17 cells both in human and mouse. Although endogenous ligands for ROR?t have not yet been reported, it is thought that ROR?t activity and Th17-cell development can be modulated with highly specific small molecules that bind to the ROR?t LBD and displace its endogenous ligands. Recent studies from multiple groups have reported the activities of such inhibitors. In this mini review, we describe how ROR?t inhibitors were identified and how they may contribute to our understanding about ROR?t and its biology.

It offers the possibility of identifying new essential targets and consequently developing new resistance transgenes. To validate the potential of Mi-Rpn7 as a target for controlling root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and to evaluate the feasibility of our modified platform for assessing silencing phenotypes, we knocked down the Rpn7 gene of M. incognita using RNAi in vitro and in vivo. After soaking with 408-bp Rpn7 dsRNA, pre-parasitic second-stage juvenile (J2) nematodes showed specific transcript knockdown, resulting in an interrupted locomotion in an attraction assay with Pluronic gel medium, and consequently in a reduction of nematode infection ranging from 55.2% to 66.5%. With in vivo expression of Rpn7 dsRNA in transformed composite plants, the amount of egg mass per gram root tissue was reduced by 34% (P < 0.05) and the number of eggs per gram root tissue was reduced by 50.8% (P < 0.05). Our results demonstrated that the silencing of the Rpn7 gene in M. incognita J2s significantly reduced motility and infectivity. Although it does not confer complete resistance, Mi-Rpn7 RNAi in hairy roots produced significant negative impacts on reproduction and motility of M. incognita.

A complete and accurate description of the metabolic network for human and other organisms is essential to foster new biological discoveries. Previous research has shown, however, that the level of agreement among pathway databases is surprisingly low. We investigated whether the lack of consensus among databases can be explained by an inaccurate representation of the knowledge described in scientific literature. As an example, we focus on the well-known tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and evaluated the description of this pathway as found in a comprehensive selection of 10 human metabolic pathway databases. Remarkably, none of the descriptions given by these databases is entirely correct. Moreover, consensus exists on only 3 reactions. Mistakes in pathway databases might lead to the propagation of incorrect knowledge, misinterpretation of high-throughput molecular data, and poorly designed follow-up experiments.

In mammals, using conditional cell ablation, two mutually exclusive mechanisms involving either intrinsic or extrinsic programs have been described to control organ size. The mammary gland is an ideal model for such studies, since it undergoes size and morphological changes during puberty and pregnancy. The role of stem cells in controlling mammary epithelial tree size is unclear, although mammary stem cells are able to reconstitute a functional organ on transplantation. Here, we show that mammary gland cellularity was strictly dependent on mammary stem cell number, even following a 20-fold expansion of the mammary stem cell pool at puberty and transient 3-fold expansions with each pregnancy. In addition, the expansion of the mammary stem cell pool was hormone dependent, as demonstrated by female bilateral ovariectomies during puberty and transplants of male-derived cells into female recipients. In these transplants, apart from a mammary stem cell expansion, we also observed the donor cells reconstituting functional mammary glands, developing alveolar structures, and secreting milk after the recipient's parturition. Taken together, these data suggest that in the mammary gland, there is a third organ size control mechanism, combining intrinsic cues throughout the organism's lifetime, with extrinsic hormone signals at particular developmental windows (puberty, pregnancy), where an expansion of the mammary stem cell pool occurs. This mechanism might have strong implications for the understanding of mammary tumorigenesis, since the expansion of the mammary stem cell pool precedes the generation of breast tumors.-Diaz-Guerra, E., Lillo, M.

Multiple signals including hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, insulin and transforming growth factor beta orchestrate these responses and are integrated during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. To investigate how these inputs influence DNA synthesis as a measure for proliferation, we established a large-scale integrated logical model connecting multiple signaling pathways and the cell cycle. We constructed our model based upon established literature knowledge, and successively improved and validated its structure using hepatocyte-specific literature as well as experimental DNA synthesis data. Model analyses showed that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways was sufficient and necessary for triggering DNA synthesis. In addition, we identified key species in these pathways that mediate DNA replication. Our model predicted oncogenic mutations that were compared with the COSMIC database, and proposed intervention targets to block hepatocyte growth factor-induced DNA synthesis, which we validated experimentally. Our integrative approach demonstrates that, despite the complexity and size of the underlying interlaced network, logical modeling enables an integrative understanding of signaling-controlled proliferation at the cellular level, and thus can provide intervention strategies for distinct perturbation scenarios at various regulatory levels.

The hybrid model for the dynamic flux balance analysis included a stoichiometric genome-scale metabolic model as a static part and dynamic equations for the uptake of glucose and the cessation of respirative metabolism. The yeast consensus genome-scale metabolic model [Herrgard MJ et al. (2008) Nat Biotechnol 26, 1155-1160; Dobson PD et al.

Dynamic flux balance analysis captured well the essential features of the dynamic metabolic behaviour of S. cerevisiae during adaptation to anaerobiosis. Modelling and simulation enabled the identification of short time-scale flux distribution dynamics under the transition to anaerobic metabolism, during which the specific growth rate was reduced, as well as longer time-scale process dynamics when the specific growth rate recovered. Expression of the metabolic genes was set into the context of the identified dynamics.

The cell cycle is a complex system regulated by molecules that are integrated into functional modules to ensure genome integrity and faithful cell division. In budding yeast, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk1/Clb) drive cell cycle progression, being activated and inactivated in a precise temporal sequence. In this module, which we refer to as the 'Clb module', different Cdk1/Clb complexes are regulated to generate waves of Clb activity, a functional property of cell cycle control. The inhibitor Sic1 plays a critical role in the Clb module by binding to and blocking Cdk1/Clb activity, ultimately setting the timing of DNA replication and mitosis. Fifteen years of research subsequent to the identification of Sic1 have lead to the development of an integrative approach that addresses its role in regulating the Clb module. Sic1 is an intrinsically disordered protein and achieves its inhibitory function by cooperative binding, where different structural regions stretch on the Cdk1/Clb surface. Moreover, Sic1 promotes S phase entry, facilitating Cdk1/Clb5 nuclear transport, and therefore revealing a double function of inhibitor/activator that rationalizes a mechanism to prevent precocious DNA replication. Interestingly, the investigation of Clb temporal dynamics by mathematical modelling and experimental validation provides evidence that Sic1 acts as a timer to coordinate oscillations of Clb cyclin waves. Here we review these findings, focusing on the design principle underlying the Clb module, which highlights the role of Sic1 in regulating phase-specific Cdk1/Clb activities.

A widely used tool within such analysis is hypothesis testing, which focuses on model rejections. However, the fact that a systems biology model is non-rejected is often a relatively weak statement, as such models usually are highly over-parametrized with respect to the available data, and both parameters and predictions may therefore be arbitrarily uncertain. For this reason, we formally define and analyse the concept of a core prediction. A core prediction is a uniquely identified property that must be fulfilled if the given model structure is to explain the data, even if the individual parameters are non-uniquely identified. It is shown that such a prediction is as strong a conclusion as a rejection. Furthermore, a new method for core prediction analysis is introduced, which is beneficial for the uncertainty of specific model properties, as the method only characterizes the space of acceptable parameters in the relevant directions. This avoids the curse of dimensionality associated with the generic characterizations used by previously proposed methods. Analysis on examples shows that the new method is comparable to profile likelihood with regard to practical identifiability, and thus generalizes profile likelihood to the more general problem of observability. If used, the concepts and methods presented herein make it possible to distinguish between a conclusion and a mere suggestion, which hopefully will contribute to a more justified confidence in systems biology analyses.

By spreading within their historical range, attaining extreme abundances, and exerting severe per-capita effects as a result of predation or competition, native invaders can create an unusual set of challenges for science, management, policy, and society. Identifying when, where, and why species become invaders in their native ranges requires additional scientific inquiry, outside the current focus of invasion biology. Management strategies often mitigate the symptoms rather than address the causes of problematic native species invasions. Convincing stakeholders to comply with management actions aimed at controlling native invaders creates societal challenges and policy makers must prioritize goals from varied and often conflicting human interests.

However, little is known about its effects in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. We investigated the clinical significance, biologic effects, and mechanisms of dysregulated KLF4 signaling. METHODS: We performed microarray analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. We used molecular biology analyses and animal models to evaluate activation and function of KLF4-vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway. RESULTS: Expression of KLF4 protein was decreased or lost in primary HCC samples, in particular, lymph node metastases, compared with normal liver tissues. Loss of KLF4 from primary tumors was significantly associated with reduced survival time and was identified as a prognostic marker. Most human HCC cell lines had losses or substantial decreases in levels of KLF4. Exogenous expression of KLF4 in HCC cells upregulated expression of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and inhibited their migration, invasion, and proliferation in vitro. When these cells were injected into mice, tumors grew more slowly and metastatsis was inhibited, compared with HCC cells that did not express KLF4. VDR is a direct transcriptional target of KLF4; we identified 2 sites in the VDR promoter that bound specifically to KLF4. Increased expression of VDR sensitized tumor cells to the inhibitory effects of vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: KLF4 binds to the promoter of VDR to regulate its expression; levels of KLF4 are reduced and levels of VDR are increased in HCC cell lines and primary tumor samples. Expression of KLF4 in HCC cells sensitizes them to the anti-proliferative effects of VD3. This pathway might be manipulated to prevent or treat liver cancer.

Several studies have investigated the association between NHPH and human disease, including Crohn's disease, lithiasis, liver disease, coronary disease, gastritis, and pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers. Novel Helicobacter taxa were identified in new vertebrate hosts, and new methodologies in the fields of identification of Helicobacter spp. and evaluation of antibiotic resistance were described. The genome of the first human-derived gastric NHPH strain (Helicobacter bizzozeronii CIII-1) was sequenced, and several studies elucidated functions of different genes in NHPH. A number of important investigations regarding pathogenesis and immunopathobiology of NHPH infections have been published including the description of a new urease in Helicobacter mustelae. Finally, the effects of the gut microbiota and probiotics on NHPH infections were investigated.

A young barn owl can adapt to imposed environmental changes, such as artificial visual distortion caused by wearing a prism. This adjustment process has been modeled mathematically and the model replicates the sensory map realignment of barn owl superior colliculus (SC) through axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. This allows the biological mechanism to be transferred to an artificial computing system and thereby imbue it with a new form of adaptability to the environment. The model is demonstrated in a real-time robot environment. Results of the experiments are compared with and without prism distortion of vision, and show improved adaptability for the robot. However, the computation speed of the embedded system in the robot is slow. A digital and analog mixed signal very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit has been fabricated to implement adaptive sensory pathway changes derived from the SC model at higher speed. VLSI experimental results are consistent with simulation results.

Therefore to study the biology and pathophysiology of pigmentation and vitiligo, reliable in vitro skin pigmentation models are required. Aim: In this study, we used primary cultured melanocytes and keratinocytes to prepare the skin co-culture model in control and vitiligo patients. Methods: The skin grafts were taken from control and patients of vitiligo. In vitro co-culture was prepared after culturing primary melanocytes and keratinocytes. Co-cultures were treated with melanogenic stimulators and inhibitors and after that tyrosinase assay, MTT assay and melanin content assay were performed. Results: Melanocytes and keratinocytes were successfully cultured from control and vitiligo patients and after that co-culture models were prepared. After treatment of co-culture model with melanogenic stimulator we found that tyrosinase activity, cell proliferation and melanin content increased whereas after treatment with melanogenic inhibitor, tyrosinase activity, cell proliferation and melanin content decreased. We also found some differences in the control co-culture model and vitiligo co-culture model. Conclusion: We successfully constructed in vitro co-culture pigmentation model for control and vitiligo patients using primary cultured melanocytes and keratinocytes. The use of primary melanocytes and keratinocytes is more appropriate over the use of transformed cells. The only limitation of these models is that these can be used for screening small numbers of compounds.

The thoroughly sessile habit of adults also belies the highly mobile and complex nature of their larval stages. Given these and other remarkable innovations in their natural history, it is perhaps not surprising that barnacles present a spectrum of opportunities for study. This symposium integrates research on barnacles in the areas of larval biology, biofouling, reproduction, biogeography, speciation, population genetics, ecological genomics, and phylogenetics. Pioneering comparisons are presented of metamorphosis among barnacles from three major lineages. Biofouling is investigated from the perspectives of biochemical and biomechanical mechanisms. Tradeoffs in reproductive specializations are scrutinized through theoretical modeling and empirical validation. Patterns of endemism and diversity are delineated in Australia and intricate species boundaries in the genus Chthamalus are elucidated for the Indo-Pacific. General methodological concerns with population expansion studies in crustaceans are highlighted using barnacle models. Data from the first, draft barnacle genome are employed to examine location-specific selection. Lastly, barnacle evolution is framed in a deep phylogenetic context and hypothetical origins of defined characters are outlined and tested. ", Zoology 10.1093/icb/ics042,Barnacles and Biofouling,"Abstract: Biofouling, the attachment and growth of organisms on submerged, man-made surfaces, has plagued ship operators for at least 2500 years. Accumulation of biofouling, including barnacles and other sessile marine invertebrates, increases the frictional resistance of ships' hulls, resulting in an increase in power and in fuel consumption required to make speed. Scientists and engineers recognized over 100 years ago that in order to solve the biofouling problem, a deeper understanding of the biology of the organisms involved, particularly with regard to larval settlement and metamorphosis and adhesives and adhesion, would be required. Barnacles have served as an important tool in pursuing this research. Over the past 20 years, the pace of these studies has accelerated, likely driven by the introduction of environmental regulations banning the most effective biofouling control products from the market. Research has largely focused on larval settlement and metamorphosis, the development of new biocides, and materials/surface science. Increased research has so far, however, failed to result in commercial applications. Two recent successes (medetomidine/Selektope (R), surface-bound noradrenaline) build on our improving understanding of the role of the larval nervous system in mediating settlement and metamorphosis. New findings with regard to the curing of barnacle adhesives may pave the way to additional successes. Although the development of most current biofouling control technologies remains largely uninfluenced by basic research on, for example, the ability of settling larvae to perceive surface cues, or the nature of the interaction between organismal adhesives and the substrate, newly-developed materials can serve as useful probes to further our understanding of these processes.

This makes them ideal models for studying evolutionary adaptations of the larval and adult body-plan, lifestyle, and reproduction. Surprisingly, despite all the work published since Darwin's seminal monographs, few studies have tested evolutionary hypotheses about Thecostraca within a phylogenetic context. In this review, we combine a Bayesian phylogenetic method and multilocus sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of 12 key thecostracan phenotypic traits associated with their lifecycle, larval biology, reproduction, and adult morphology. Our analyses show that thecostracan biological diversity resulted both from unique innovations and from events of convergence. This provides an opportunity to reevaluate previous classifications of the Thecostraca and the theories relating to the origin and diversification of this taxon.

The floral anatomy of xyrid species was studied, to contribute to the understanding of the relationships within the group. Both Eriocaulaceae and Xyridaceae have petals with elongated epidermal cells with straight walls, epipetalous stamens, staminodes, anthers with longitudinal dehiscence, an endothecium with band-like thickenings, and a style vascularized by the dorsal carpellary bundles; these characteristics thus corroborate the close relationship of these groups indicated by phylogenetic analyses. Mayacaceae is distinguished by the presence of papillose epidermal cells in the petals, a reduced inner whorl of stamens, poricidal anthers, an endothecium lacking thickenings, a style and stigma vascularized by the dorsal and ventral carpellary bundles, and the presence of an obturator in the ovary wall. A reduction in the inner whorl of fertile stamens also occurs in Juncaceae and Cyperaceae, linking Mayacaceae to the cyperids. The stylar appendages of Orectanthe (Xyridaceae) have been shown to be nectariferous and anatomically similar to those of Abolboda, differentiating these two genera from Xyris (Xyridoideae) and confirming their placement in Abolbodoideae. Stylar appendages also occur in Eriocaulaceae, with the same function, position, and vascularization, and are therefore homologous structures, reinforcing the phylogenetic proximity between Eriocaulaceae and Xyridaceae.

We tested these predictions in a characteristic Eurasian steppe plant, Stipa pennata, by inspecting 230 AFLP bands in 26 populations (345 individuals) along a 3300-km longitudinal gradient from the range core, in Russia, to the range periphery, in central Europe. Overall, our study species showed low genetic diversity within populations (mean proportion of polymorphic bands = 21.2%) and moderately high genetic differentiation among them (mean Phi(ST) = 0.29). As predicted, genetic diversity declined significantly from the range core to the periphery but was not correlated with population size. Pairwise genetic differentiation was significantly higher among peripheral populations than central populations but did not show a pronounced relationship with geographic distance. Our results indicate that peripheral populations may experience higher genetic drift and lower gene flow than their central counterparts, possibly because of smaller population sizes, spatial isolation, and a more complex landscape structure. In addition, historic range fluctuations and the mixed breeding system could have enhanced the observed patterns in our study species.

However, in suspecting that such analysis should be attentive to the concurrent individual and social co-constitution of behaviours, a sociological and post-structural interrogation of this characterization of body modification as a sovereign, denaturalizing endeavour is demanded. An engagement with the originary violence of Derridian deconstruction will duly re-conceive body modification practice as not something which introduces violence to corporeality. Rather, violence will present as a primordial differentiating process which bodies always already condition, and by which they are conditioned/produced/modified. The second issue at stake in this article will thus develop as a contestation to the characterization of body modification as an exclusive category of practice. Such practices do not arrive, pre-existing, but rather manifest as the originary violence/differentiation of bodies-as-modifications-which-modify. This re-defines modification from something that agentive subjects introduce to bodies, to something that subjects-as-bodies cannot help but be. Consequently, individual agency is not divorced from behaviour, but emerges as a corporeal, social production.

Thus, understanding how nest predation and failure vary in nature is important for understanding life history evolution and, moreover, for effective conservation. We used published data and unpublished records to study factors influencing nest predation and total failure in 138 populations of 90 species of Australian songbirds. Daily predation (average 2.0% d-1) and failure rates (2.9%) increased from temperate regions to the tropics, over the last four decades, and were lowest in temperate south-western Australia. Predation and failure were higher in smaller species, and failure rates were lower in species with closed nests than in species with open nests. There was no effect of nest height or nest site (ground, shrub, canopy) or social organization on nest predation or failure rates. Nest predation caused on average 72% of total nest failure, similar to other tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas. Our study spanning from the tropics to temperate regions and using > 10 000 nests confirmed that tropical birds faced higher nest failure rates. We identified an increase in nest depredation rates in the last four decades in Australia, suggesting that a large-scale ecological phenomenon must be responsible. It may include increases in predator abundances and/or ranges, possibly connected with human-caused habitat change. A global comparison of nest failure rates confirmed that predation is the main source of nest mortality in songbirds worldwide. We discuss implications of our results for the evolution of reproductive strategies and for the conservation of Australian birds.

However, the cellular redox processes governing the biomineralization of the mixed-valence iron oxide have remained unknown. Here, we show that in the alphaproteobacterium Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, magnetite biomineralization is linked to dissimilatory nitrate reduction. A complete denitrification pathway, including gene functions for nitrate (nap), nitrite (nir), nitric oxide (nor), and nitrous oxide reduction (nos), was identified. Transcriptional gusA fusions as reporters revealed that except for nap, the highest expression of the denitrification genes coincided with conditions permitting maximum magnetite synthesis. Whereas microaerobic denitrification overlapped with oxygen respiration, nitrate was the only electron acceptor supporting growth in the entire absence of oxygen, and only the deletion of nap genes, encoding a periplasmic nitrate reductase, and not deletion of nor or nos genes, abolished anaerobic growth and also delayed aerobic growth in both nitrate and ammonium media. While loss of nosZ or norCB had no or relatively weak effects on magnetosome synthesis, deletion of nap severely impaired magnetite biomineralization and resulted in fewer, smaller, and irregular crystals during denitrification and also microaerobic respiration, probably by disturbing the proper redox balance required for magnetite synthesis. In contrast to the case for the wild type, biomineralization in Delta nap cells was independent of the oxidation state of carbon substrates. Altogether, our data demonstrate that in addition to its essential role in anaerobic respiration, the periplasmic nitrate reductase Nap has a further key function by participating in redox reactions required for magnetite biomineralization.

To evaluate the effects of the DPP4 inhibitor linagliptin on beta-cell mass and insulinitis, we examined the progression of diabetes (blood glucose >11 mmol/l) in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with terminal stereological assessment of cellular pancreatic changes. Female NOD mice were fed a normal chow diet or a diet containing linagliptin 0.083 g/kg chow for 60 days. At study end, the incidence of diabetes in linagliptin-treated mice was reduced by almost 50% compared with vehicle (10 of 31 mice vs 18 of 30 mice, P=0.021). The total islet mass and total beta-cell mass, identified by insulin immunoreactivity, were greater in non-diabetic linagliptin-treated mice compared with nondiabetic vehicle-treated mice (P<0.01 for both) but were greatly reduced in diabetic mice irrespective of treatment. No changes were seen in the alpha, delta and gamma endocrine cell pool. Moreover, the total mass of lymphocyte insulinitis was significantly reduced in linagliptin-treated mice compared with vehicle. The data indicate that linagliptin treatment delays the onset of diabetes in NOD mice by protecting beta-cell mass.

In the past few years there have been numerous advances in all aspects of NETs including: an understanding of their unique pathogenesis; specific classification systems developed which have prognostic value; novel methods of tumor localization developed; and novel treatment approaches described. In patients with advanced metastatic disease these include the use of newer chemotherapeutic approaches, an increased understanding of the role of surgery and cytoreductive methods, the development of methods for targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents, and the development of targeted medical therapies (everolimus, sunitinib) based on an increased understanding of the disease biology. Although pNETs and gastrointestinal NETs share many features, recent studies show they differ in pathogenesis and in many aspects of diagnosis and treatment, including their responsiveness to different therapies. Because of limited space, this review will be limited to the advances made in the management and treatment of patients with advanced metastatic pNETs over the past 5 years.

In the case of renal vessels, sex differences could influence processes like regulation of blood pressure and ion balance. Angiotensin II and nitric oxide are important regulators of renal vascular tone. Females have higher nitric oxide synthase expression, nitric oxide bioavailability and ratio of angiotensin II type 2/type 1 receptors. Thus, our objective was to examine whether renal interlobar arteries present sex differences in their response to angiotensin II, and whether angiotensin II type 2 receptors play a role in such differences.Methods: We investigated the isometric contraction and relaxation of interlobar arteries from female and male mice under blockade of nitric oxide synthases and angiotensin II type 2 receptors. We also investigated the expression of angiotensin II receptors (type 1 and 2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase.Results: Significantly less intense contraction to angiotensin II were seen in arteries from females in comparison to male mice. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthases and endothelial removal abolished this difference. Angiotensin II type 2 receptors blockade enhanced contraction to angiotensin II in females, but not in males. Endothelial-dependent vasodilation was more dependent on nitric oxide in females than in males. Expression of angiotensin II type 1 and type 2 receptors was similar between sexes. Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was higher in females.Conclusion: A sex-specific, nitric oxide-mediated effect via angiotensin II type 2 receptors underlies the sex differences in the response of interlobar arteries to angiotensin II. Our findings may help understanding sex differences in renal hemodynamics and blood pressure control.

This approach has yielded a plethora of new preclinical therapeutics directed at novel targets within oncology. In many ways, the evolution of molecular imaging agents as diagnostic probes mirrors that of chemotherapeutics; yet despite an increasing number of PET and SPECT radiotracers being evaluated in human trials, relatively few agents have found widespread use in clinical oncology.

In this article, we argue that PET has enormous potential to deliver clinically relevant information on disease dynamics that extends beyond mapping the density and spatial distribution of a target.

The tools currently available to risk-stratify patients are limited. This study assessed the prognostic utility of metabolic measurements derived from F-18-FDG PET compared with previously proposed prognostic scoring systems. Methods: Preoperative F-18-FDG PET/CT studies from a series of 30 patients who underwent liver resection for CRLM after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were evaluated. Quantitative F-18-FDG PET analysis calculated the maximum and mean standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and tumor glycolytic volume (TGV) as measures of the metabolic activity of tumors. The predictive value of these parameters was compared with that of 4 prognostic scores developed by Fong, Iwatsuki, Nordlinger, and Rees. Results: High MTV and TGV in patients before metastasectomy were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (MTV: P = 0.001; TGV: P = 0.004) and recurrence-free survival (MTV: P = 0.001, TGV; P = 0.002). Maximum and mean standardized uptake value did not show any significant predictive ability. Of the prognostic scores, prediction of outcome was most accurate using the Basingstoke index (area under the curve, 0.898).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chronic oxidative changes in membrane lipids and proteins found in many chronic diseases are not the result of accidental damage. Instead, these changes are the result of a highly evolved, stereotyped, and protein-catalyzed ""oxidative shielding"" response that all eukaryotes adopt when placed in a chemically or microbially hostile environment. The machinery of oxidative shielding evolved from pathways of innate immunity designed to protect the cell from attack and limit the spread of infection. Both oxidative and reductive stress trigger oxidative shielding. In the cases in which it has been studied explicitly, functional and metabolic defects occur in the cell before the increase in ROS and oxidative changes. ROS are the response to disease, not the cause. Therefore, it is not the oxidative changes that should be targeted for therapy, but rather the metabolic conditions that create them. This fresh perspective is relevant to diseases that range from autism, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer disease. Research efforts need to be redirected. Oxidative shielding is protective and is a misguided target for therapy. Identification of the causal chemistry and environmental factors that trigger innate immunity and metabolic memory that initiate and sustain oxidative shielding is paramount for human health.

Different approaches are used such as deterministic and stochastic models, models that describe cell growth and division explicitly or implicitly etc. Here we consider simple systems of unregulated (constitutive) gene expression and compare different mathematical descriptions systematically to obtain insight into the errors that are introduced by various common approximations such as describing cell growth and division by an effective protein degradation term. In particular, we show that the population average of protein content of a cell exhibits a subtle dependence on the dynamics of growth and division, the specific model for volume growth and the age structure of the population. Nevertheless, the error made by models with implicit cell growth and division is quite small. Furthermore, we compare various models that are partially stochastic to investigate the impact of different sources of (intrinsic) noise. This comparison indicates that different sources of noise (protein synthesis, partitioning in cell division) contribute comparable amounts of noise if protein synthesis is not or only weakly bursty. If protein synthesis is very bursty, the burstiness is the dominant noise source, independent of other details of the model. Finally, we discuss two sources of extrinsic noise: cell-to-cell variations in protein content due to cells being at different stages in the division cycles, which we show to be small (for the protein concentration and, surprisingly, also for the protein copy number per cell) and fluctuations in the growth rate, which can have a significant impact.

By numerically evolving gene regulatory networks, the proportionality between the phenotypic variances of epigenetic and genetic origins is confirmed. The former is given by the variance of the phenotypic fluctuation due to noise in the developmental process; and the latter, by the variance of the phenotypic fluctuation due to genetic mutation. The relationship suggests a link between robustness to noise and to mutation, since robustness can be defined by the sharpness of the distribution of the phenotype. Next, the proportionality between the variances is demonstrated to also hold over expressions of different genes (phenotypic traits) when the system acquires robustness through the evolution. Then, evolution under environmental variation is numerically investigated and it is found that both the adaptability to a novel environment and the robustness are made compatible when a certain degree of phenotypic fluctuations exists due to noise. The highest adaptability is achieved at a certain noise level at which the gene expression dynamics are near the critical state to lose the robustness. Based on our results, we revisit Waddington's canalization and genetic assimilation with regard to the two types of phenotypic fluctuations.

This is dependent on the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Understanding how LANA transcription is regulated thus aids our fundamental understanding of KSHV biology. Two hundred ninety-four base pairs are sufficient to regulate LANA transcription in response to the viral RTA protein and RBPj kappa. The same region controls K14/viral G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) transcription in the opposite direction. We used a quantitative analysis in conjunction with specific nucleotide substitutions and defined gain-of-function and loss-of-function RTA mutants to dissect this region. We used a bidirectional reporter driving red and green luciferase to study the LANApi and K14p promoters simultaneously. This established that LANApi/K14p functions as a canonical bidirectional promoter. Both were TATA dependent. K14p was favored by similar to 50-fold in this context. Eliminating the distal LANApi TATA box increased maximal output and lowered the induction threshold (T) of K14p even further. Two RBPj kappa binding sites were independently required; however, at high concentrations of RTA, direct interactions with an RTA-responsive element (RRE) could complement the loss of one RBPj kappa binding site. Intracellular Notch (ICN) was no longer able to activate RBPj kappa in the viral context. This suggests a model whereby KSHV alters ICN-RBPj kappa gene regulation. When the architecture of this pair of head-to-head RBPj kappa binding sites is changed, the sites now respond exclusively to the viral transactivator RTA and no longer to the host mediator ICN.

However, such specific N-linked glycosylation sites do not exist in some field PRRSV isolates. This implies that the existence of GP5-associated glycan per se is not vital to the virus life cycle. In this study, we found that mutation of individual glycosylation sites at N30, N35, N44, and N51 in GP5 did not affect virus infectivity in cultured cells. However, the mutants carrying multiple mutations at N-linked glycosylation sites in GP5 had significantly reduced virus yields compared with the wild-type (wt) virus. As a result, no viremia and antibody response were detected in piglets that were injected with a mutant without all N-linked glycans in GP5. These results suggest that the N-linked glycosylation of GP5 is critically important for virus replication in vivo. The study also showed that removal of N44-linked glycan from GP5 increased the sensitivity of mutant virus to convalescent-phase serum samples but did not elicit a high-level neutralizing antibody response to wt PRRSV. The results obtained from the present study have made significant contributions to better understanding the importance of glycosylation of GP5 in the biology of PRRSV.

LANA binds to KSHV terminal repeat (TR) DNA and tethers the viral episomes to host chromosomes through the association of chromatin-bound cellular proteins. TR elements serve as potential origin sites of KSHV replication and have been shown to play important roles in latent DNA replication and transcription of adjacent genes. Affinity chromatography and proteomics analysis using KSHV TR DNA and the LANA binding site as the affinity column identified topoisomerase II beta (TopoII beta) as a LANA-interacting protein. Here, we show that TopoII beta forms complexes with LANA that colocalize as punctuate bodies in the nucleus of KSHV-infected cells. The specific TopoII beta binding region of LANA has been identified to its N terminus and the first 32 amino acid residues containing the nucleosome-binding region crucial for binding. Moreover, this region could also act as a dominant negative to disrupt association of TopoII beta with LANA. TopoII beta plays an important role in LANA-dependent latent DNA replication, as addition of ellipticine, a selective inhibitor of TopoII, negatively regulated replication mediated by the TR. DNA break labeling and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay using biotin-16-dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase showed that TopoII beta mediates a transient DNA break on viral DNA. These studies confirm that LANA recruits TopoII beta at the origins of latent replication to unwind the DNA for replication.

", Virology 10.1101/lm.026849.112,Consolidation and translation regulation,"Abstract: mRNA translation, or protein synthesis, is a major component of the transformation of the genetic code into any cellular activity. This complicated, multistep process is divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation is the step at which the ribosome is recruited to the mRNA, and is regarded as the major rate-limiting step in translation, while elongation consists of the elongation of the polypeptide chain; both steps are frequent targets for regulation, which is defined as a change in the rate of translation of an mRNA per unit time. In the normal brain, control of translation is a key mechanism for regulation of memory and synaptic plasticity consolidation, i.e., the off-line processing of acquired information. These regulation processes may differ between different brain structures or neuronal populations. Moreover, dysregulation of translation leads to pathological brain function such as memory impairment. Both normal and abnormal function of the translation machinery is believed to lead to translational up-regulation or down-regulation of a subset of mRNAs. However, the identification of these newly synthesized proteins and determination of the rates of protein synthesis or degradation taking place in different neuronal types and compartments at different time points in the brain demand new proteomic methods and system biology approaches. Here, we discuss in detail the relationship between translation regulation and memory or synaptic plasticity consolidation while focusing on a model of cortical-dependent taste learning task and hippocampal-dependent plasticity. In addition, we describe a novel systems biology perspective to better describe consolidation.

Although diffuse staining is generally accepted as positive, the significance of partial staining has not been established, nor has the cutoff for extent of p16 staining that should be used to identify a tumor as HPV-related. From three other large studies utilizing p16 immunohistochemistry, we identified all cases with partial positive staining. The p16-stained slides were reviewed by three study pathologists for staining (nuclear and cytoplasmic) extent (in quartiles), and also for percentage that was confluent (ie, back-to-back cell staining). Tumors were histologically typed (keratinizing, non-keratinizing, or non-keratinizing with maturation) and tested for high-risk HPV by RNA in-situ hybridization and reverse-transcriptase PCR. For the 16 cases, there were two 4 + (13%), five 3 + (31%), six 2 + (38%), and three 1 + (19%) p16 staining tumors. Extent of staining ranged from 5 to 90% of cells positive with 25% or more confluent staining in 4/16 (25%). Of the 16 (31%) cases, 5 were HPV-related on the basis of RNA in-situ hybridization and reverse-transcriptase PCR. All of these cases had >50% p16 staining, 4/5 (80%) had more than 25% confluent staining, and 4/7 (57%) had non-keratinizing histological features. Only one of the p161 + /2 + tumors was HPV RNA-positive (by reverse-transcriptase PCR only and low level). All 1 + /2 + cases were keratinizing type or undifferentiated. By sensitive detection methods, most partial p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma cases with >50% staining harbor transcriptionally active HPV, and most HPV + tumors have significant amounts of confluent staining. Cases with <50% p16 staining and lacking significant confluent staining rarely harbor HPV. These results support that greater than 75% p16 staining or, alternatively, >50% staining combined with >25% confluent areas, are suitable cutoffs for defining positivity.

Understanding population genetic structure within a continuous population can give insights into social structure, movement across the landscape and contact between populations, which influence ecological interactions, reproductive dynamics or pathogen transmission. We investigated the genetic structure of a large population of deer spanning the area of Wisconsin and Illinois, USA, affected by chronic wasting disease. We combined multiscale investigation, landscape genetic techniques and spatial statistical modelling to address the complex questions of landscape factors influencing population structure. We sampled over 2000 deer and used spatial autocorrelation and a spatial principal components analysis to describe the population genetic structure. We evaluated landscape effects on this pattern using a spatial autoregressive model within a model selection framework to test alternative hypotheses about gene flow. We found high levels of genetic connectivity, with gradients of variation across the large continuous population of white-tailed deer. At the fine scale, spatial clustering of related animals was correlated with the amount and arrangement of forested habitat. At the broader scale, impediments to dispersal were important to shaping genetic connectivity within the population. We found significant barrier effects of individual state and interstate highways and rivers. Our results offer an important understanding of deer biology and movement that will help inform the management of this species in an area where overabundance and disease spread are primary concerns.

However, this assumption may overlook unorthodox, infrequent or cryptic sexuality. Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, is known to undergo non-Mendelian genetic exchange in the laboratory. In the field, evidence of extant genetic exchange is limited. In this study, we undertook intensive sampling of T. cruzi Discrete Typing Unit I in endemic eastern Colombia. Using Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we generated 269 biological clones from 67 strains. Each clone was genotyped across 24 microsatellite loci. Subsequently, 100 representative clones were typed using 10 mitochondrial sequence targets (3.76 Kbp total). Clonal diversity among humans, reservoir hosts and vectors suggested complex patterns of superinfection and/or coinfection in oral and vector-borne Chagas disease cases. Clonal diversity between mother and foetus in a congenital case demonstrates that domestic TcI genotypes are infective in utero. Importantly, gross incongruence between nuclear and mitochondrial markers is strong evidence for widespread genetic exchange throughout the data set. Furthermore, a confirmed mosaic maxicircle sequence suggests intermolecular recombination between individuals as a further mechanism of genetic reassortment. Finally, robust dating based on mitochondrial DNA indicates that the emergence of a widespread domestic TcI clade that we now name TcIDOM (formerly TcIa/VENDom) occurred 23 000 +/- 12 000 years ago and was followed by population expansion, broadly corresponding with the earliest human migration into the Americas.

Dendritic cells (DCs) orchestrate immune responses at various stages and bridge innate immunity and adaptive immunity. DCs are a family of cells consisting of various subsets distinguished by surface markers, locations, and transcription factors that govern their development, differentiation, and homeostasis. The complexity of DC subset biology has hindered the understanding of the functional differences among DC subsets. The subset expressing the surface molecule CD8 alpha is of particular interest, due to the efficiency of this DC subset in priming CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells and cross-presenting exogenous antigens to CD8(+) T cells. CD8 alpha (+) DCs maintain tolerance to autologous antigens at steady state, but when activated secrete IL-12, polarizing T helper (Th) 1 responses. Recently, novel DC subsets were found to be present in peripheral tissues and the relationship between CD8 alpha(+) DCs in lymphoid organs and DC subsets in peripheral tissues has been revealed. This review describes the pedigree of CD8 alpha (+) DCs and related subsets, including a history of the discovery of DC subsets and their functional characterization.

Although they are dominant in mixed species forests and widely distributed, there are frequent reports of regeneration failures. An adequate population of large oak advance reproduction is a critical prerequisite to successful oak regeneration, and hence sustainability of oak. But, many oak forests lack sufficient density of large and competitive oak advance reproduction. Artificial regeneration of oak by underplanting is done to supplement natural populations of oak seedlings or to introduce oak in stands where it is missing. Planting high quality seedlings is important. Silvicultural practices that regulate stand density such as thinning and the shelterwood method are needed to increase oak's regeneration potential by promoting accumulation and growth of natural and planted seedlings before the final regeneration harvest. Control of competing vegetation and herbivory are important elements in the regeneration prescription. Light in the understory is a limiting factor to the accumulation of large oak advance reproduction. Light levels (20-50 % +) sufficient for biomass production in oak reproduction result through management of stand density and other competing vegetation. We review and synthesize the literature on silvicultural approaches to using artificial regeneration to obtain successful oak regeneration that is grounded in fundamental principles of oak biology and ecology. Principles of oak regeneration presented here may also have relevance to other hydric, mesic and dry-mesic forest environments.

These remains allowed us to obtain a first overview of the prey of barn owls on that island, knowing that elsewhere mammals constitute the major prey group. The dominant prey species were banded geckos (Gekko vittatus-47% of prey individuals found in our bone sample) followed by rats (Rattus spp.-35%). Also present were lesser numbers of other gecko species (Gehyra oceanica, Nactus multicarinatus), skinks (Emoia spp.), birds, and bats. Data show that nocturnal birds of prey remain important predators of large geckos on Toga Island. This finding contradicts interpretations of other late historical (following human colonisation), non-cultural bone assemblages from barn owls from other Pacific islands, where rats have replaced geckos as primary prey. The same situation as reported on Toga Island occurs in other places like the Canary Islands where barn owls also prey predominantly on an endemic gecko species. These observations suggest that the barn owl is an opportunistic predator taking whatever prey is available. The unanswered question is why geckos are the most frequent prey of barn owls on some islands and not on others.

In total, 1505 beetles from 90 species were collected using modified Malaise traps. Native wetland vegetation had significantly lower beetle species richness than willow-dominated vegetation and was dominated by herbivores, whereas detritivores characterised willow-dominated vegetation. Beetle abundance was highest in the willow-dominated vegetation and mostly comprised detritivores. In contrast, beetle abundance was lowest in native wetland vegetation, but had even proportions of herbivores and detritivores. Native wetland vegetation had a high proportion of native beetles present. As grey willows invaded, introduced beetles became more common. The beetle community composition differed significantly between grey willow-dominated vegetation and native wetland vegetation. These compositional differences were mainly due to the increasing complexity of vegetation structure following grey willow invasion. The beetle communities within restored native wetland vegetation were most similar to those within the native wetland vegetation. From a conservation perspective, these results are encouraging and suggest that, although grey willows dramatically alter the composition of beetle communities present, these communities can be restored to a beetle fauna that is similar to those found within native wetland through the removal of the willows.

We have used a combination of affinity-purification methods and proteomics approaches to isolate these complexes and assess protein dynamics with respect to pADPr metabolism. As a first approach, we developed a substrate trapping strategy by which we demonstrate that a catalytically inactive Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) mutant can act as a physiologically selective bait for the isolation of specific pADPr-binding proteins through its macrodomain-like domain. In addition to antibody-mediated affinity-purification methods, we used a pADPr macrodomain affinity resin to recover pADPr-binding proteins and their complexes. Second, we designed a time course experiment to explore the changes in the composition of pADPr-containing multiprotein complexes in response to alkylating DNA damage-mediated PARP activation. Spectral count clustering based on GeLC-MS/MS analysis was complemented with further analyses using high precision quantitative proteomics through isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)- and Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics. Here, we present a valuable resource in the interpretation of systems biology of the DNA damage response network in the context of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and provide a basis for subsequent investigations of pADPr-binding protein candidates.

Given the potential usefulness of such a system, we have developed one for mammalian 18S rRNA. We inserted a sequence tag into expansion segment 3 of mouse 18S rRNA to monitor expression and cleavage by hybridization. Mutations were identified that confer resistance to pactamycin, allowing functional analysis of 40S ribosomal subunits containing synthetic 18S rRNAs by selectively blocking translation from endogenous (pactamycin-sensitive) subunits. rRNA constructs were suitably expressed in transfected cells, shown to process correctly, incorporate into approximate to 15% of 40S subunits, and function normally based on various criteria. After rigorous analysis, the system was used to investigate the importance of sequences that flank 18S rRNA in precursor transcripts. Although deletion analysis supported the requirement of binding sites for the U3 snoRNA, it showed that a large segment of the 5' external transcribed spacer and the entire first internal transcribed spacer, both of which flank 18S rRNA, are not required. The success of this approach opens the possibility of functional analyses of ribosomes, with applications in basic research and synthetic biology.

In an attempt to address this problem with synthetic biology tools, we designed a panel of short chimeric alpha,beta-triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) and studied their interaction with fluorescently labelled duplex hairpins using various techniques. The hybridization of hairpin with an array of chimeric probes suggests that recognition of double-stranded DNA follows complicated rules combining reversed Hoogsteen and non-canonical homologous hydrogen bonding. In the presence of magnesium ions, chimeric TFOs are able to form highly stable alpha,beta-triplexes, as indicated by native gel-electrophoresis, on-array thermal denaturation and fluorescence-quenching experiments. CD spectra of chimeric triplexes exhibited features typically observed for anti-parallel purine triplexes with a GA or GT third strand.

We build on research on epistemic cultures and knowing in practice to develop empirically grounded theory for the role of digital science in complex innovation. We propose that digitalization creates a new form of knowledge that provides essential complementary insights for complex innovation that cannot exist otherwise. However, digitalization also creates new knowledge boundaries that concern central activities of innovation.

Halicephalobus gingivalis is a free-living bacterivorous nematode and a known facultative parasite of horses with a strong indication of some form of tolerance to common anthelmintic drugs. This research presents the results of an in vitro study on the anthelmintic tolerance of several isolates of Halicephalobus to thiabendazole and ivermectin using an adaptation of the Micro-Agar Larval Development Test hereby focusing on egg hatching and larval development. Panagrellus redivivus and Panagrolaimus superbus were included as a positive control.

Our results further reveal a remarkable trend of increasing tolerance from fully free-living isolates towards horse-associated isolates. In vitro anthelmintic testing with free-living and facultative parasitic nematodes offers the advantage of observing drug effect on the complete life cycle as opposed to obligatory parasites that can only be followed until the third larval stage.

Phytopathology 102:827-840.The bacterial canker of kiwifruit caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae is a severe threat to kiwifruit production worldwide. Many aspects of P syringae pv. actinidiae biology and epidemiology still require in-depth investigation. The infection by and spread of P syringae pv. actinidiae in xylem and phloem was investigated by carrying out artificial inoculation experiments with histological and dendrochronological analyses of naturally diseased plants in Italy. We found that the bacterium can infect host plants by entering natural openings and lesions. In naturally infected kiwifruit plants, P syringae pv. actinidiae is present in the lenticels as well as in the dead phloem tissue beneath the lenticels, surrounded by a lesion in the periderm which appears to indicate the importance of lenticels to kiwifruit infection. Biofilm formation was observed outside and inside plants. In cases of advanced stages of P syringae pv. actinidiae infection, neuroses of the phloem occur, which are followed by cambial dieback and most likely by infection of the xylem. Anatomical changes in wood such as reduced ring width, a drastic reduction in vessel size, and the presence of tyloses were observed within several infected sites. In the field, these changes occur only a year after the first leaf symptoms are observed suggesting a significant time lapse between primary and secondary symptoms. It was possible to study the temporal development of P. syringae pv. actinidiae-induced cambial dieback by applying dendrochronology methods which revealed that cambial dieback occurs only during the growing season.

Cdc42 activation was measured after ET-1 treatment of HTR-8/SVneo cells. To determine the ET receptor subtype involved in ET-1-mediated Cdc42 activation, experiments were performed in the presence of ETA and ETB receptor antagonists. Finally, using siRNA we knocked down the expression of Cdc42 to examine the involvement of Cdc42 in the regulation of ET-1-stimulated trophoblast cell migration.Results: ET-1 was shown to have a dose-dependent effect on trophoblast migration. At low concentrations of ET-1 (0.1 nmol/L) ET-1 had a stimulatory effect on cell migration. ET-1 (10 nmol/L) increased HTR-8/svneo cell migration index by 2.5 fold. ET-1 (10 nmol/L) elevated protein level and activity of Cdc42. ET1 induced activation of Cdc42 GTPase was mediated by both ETA and ETB. ET-1-induced cell migration was shown to be inhibited by Cdc42 siRNA.The inhibition was not mitigated by the addition of ET-1, suggesting that Cdc42 plays an important role in trophoblast migration and is obligatory for ET-1 action.Conclusions: ET-1 stimulates EVT migration through Cdc42 activation.

Molecular biology techniques offer the most efficient approach to address these concerns. Inducible plant defense responses include the production of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and chitinases are very important PR proteins. We collected 30 chitinase like genes, three from our full-length cDNA library of Brassica rapa cv. Osome and 27 from Brassica databases. Sequence analysis and comparison study confirmed that they were all class I-V and VII chitinase genes. These genes also showed a high degree of homology with other biotic stress resistance-related plant chitinases. An organ-specific expression of these genes was observed and among these, seven genes showed significant responses after infection with Fusarium oxysporum tsp. conglutinans in cabbage and sixteen genes showed responsive expression after abiotic stress treatments in Chinese cabbage. BrCLP1, 8, 10, 17 and 18 responded commonly after biotic and abiotic stress treatments indicating their higher potentials.

The nuclear pore complex (NPC) contains multiple Q/N-rich proteins whose self-assembly has also been proposed to underlie structural and functional properties of the NPC. Here we show that an essential sequence feature of these proteins-repeating GLFG motifs-strongly promotes their self-assembly into amyloids with characteristics of prions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Nup100 can form bona fide prions, thus establishing a previously undiscovered ability of yeast GLFG nucleoporins to adopt this conformational state in vivo.

ArmRPs can form the basis of modular peptide recognition and the ArmRP version on which synthetic libraries are based must be as stable as possible. The 42-residue internal Arm repeats had been designed previously using a sequence-consensus method. Heteronuclear NMR revealed unfavorable interactions present at neutral but absent at high pH. Two lysines per repeat were involved in repulsive interactions, and stability was increased by mutating both to glutamine. Five point mutations in the capping repeats were suggested by the analysis of positional fluctuations and configurational entropy along multiple MD simulations. The most stabilizing single C-cap mutation Q240L was inferred from explicit solvent MD simulations, in which water penetrated the ArmRP. All mutants were characterized by temperature- and denaturant-unfolding studies and the improved mutants were established as monomeric species with cooperative folding and increased stability against heat and denaturant. Importantly, the mutations tested resulted in a cumulative decrease of flexibility of the folded state in silico and a cumulative increase of thermodynamic stability in vitro. The final construct has a melting temperature of about 85 degrees C, 14.5 degrees higher than the starting sequence. This work indicates that in silico studies in combination with heteronuclear NMR and other biophysical tools may provide a basis for successfully selecting mutations that rapidly improve biophysical properties of the target proteins.

The physiological process of ovulation in the normal ovary involves various chemokines that mediate the healing of the ruptured endometrium. It is now being reported that many of these chemokines are also associated with the cancer of the ovary. Chronic inflammation underlies the progression of ovarian cancer; therefore, it raises the possibility that chemokines are involved in the inflammatory process and mediate immune responses that may favour or inhibit tumour progression. Ovarian cancer is a gynaecological cancer responsible for highest rate of mortality in women. Although there have been several investigations and advances in surgery and chemotherapy, the survival rate for this disease remains low. This is mainly because of a lack of specific symptoms and biomarkers for detection. In this review, we have discussed the emerging role of the CXC chemokines in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The CXC group of chemokines is gaining importance in the field of ovarian cancer for being angiostatic and angiogenic in function. While there have been several studies on the angiogenesis function, emerging research shows that ELR- CXC chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, are angiostatic. Importantly, the angiostatic chemokines can inhibit the progression of EOC. Given that there are currently no biomarkers or specific therapeutic targets for the disease, these chemokines are emerging as promising targets for therapy.

This test requires relatively large animal numbers, given that parental and offspring generations are involved. In vitro assay designs and systems biology paradigms are being developed to reduce animal use and to improve prediction of human hazard. Such approaches could benefit from the long-term experience with animal protocols and more specifically from information on the relevance of effects observed in these tests for developmental toxicity. Therefore, we have analyzed relative parameter sensitivity in 22 publicly available developmental toxicity studies, representing about one third of all classified developmental toxicants under European legislation. Maternal and fetal weight effects and fetal survival were most often affected parameters at the developmental Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (dLOAEL), followed by skeletal malformations. Specific end points such as cleft palate were observed in fewer studies at dLOAEL, but if observed may have been crucial in classification and labeling decisions. These results are similar to earlier studies using different selections of chemicals, indicating that in general classified developmental toxicants have a similar pattern of effects at the dLOAEL as chemicals in general. These findings are discussed within the perspective of the development of innovative alternative approaches to developmental hazard assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While O. mossambicus are now not commonly used as an aquaculture species, the biological traits that made them a popular culture species including tolerance to wide ranging ecological conditions, generalist dietary requirements and rapid reproduction with maternal care have also made them a 'model' invader. Self-sustaining populations now exist in almost every region to which they have been imported. In Australia, since their introduction in the 1970s, O. mossambicus have become established in catchments along the east and west coasts and have the potential to colonise other adjacent drainages. It is thought that intentional translocations are likely to be the most significant factor in their spread in Australia. The ecological and physical tolerances and preferences, reproductive behaviour, hybridization and the high degree of plasticity in the life history traits of O. mossambicus are reviewed. Impacts of O. mossambicus on natural ecosystems including competitive displacement of native species, habitat alteration, predation and as a vector in the spread of diseases are discussed. Potential methods for eradicating or controlling invasive populations of O. mossambicus including physical removal, piscicides, screens, environmental management and genetic technologies are outlined.

These formulae correspond to different curves and yield different parameter estimates with different biological interpretations.

Disciplines that are covered range from the taxonomy, genetics and systematics, through a variety of biological and ecological attributes, to biomarker and fisheries studies. The eurytopic nature of M. cephalus is emphasized, with the migratory life history covering a succession of very different aquatic environments (e.g. rivers, estuaries, coastal lakes/lagoons, marine littoral, open ocean), each of which is occupied for varying lengths of time, depending on the population characteristics within a region and the life-history stage of the species. Interpretation of these movements over time has been greatly enhanced by the use of otolith microchemistry which has enabled scientists to map out the different habitats occupied by individual fish at the different life stages. The range of physico-chemical attributes within these environments necessitates a wide tolerance to differing conditions, especially with regard to salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and temperature, all of which are discussed in this review. The importance of M. cephalus to the ecological functioning of coastal systems is emphasized, as well as the pivotal role that this species fulfills in fisheries in some parts of the world. The parasites range from internal trematode and cestode infestations, to external branchyuran and copepod parasites, which use M. cephalus as either an intermediate or final host. The value of the flathead mullet as a biomarker for the monitoring of the health of coastal habitats is discussed, as well as its potential as an indicator or sentinel species for certain ecosystems.

Commercial sturgeon aquaculture and conservation program requires broodfish management as well as biogeographical and biological knowledge. Therefore, control of sturgeon reproduction in captivity can become as a valid tool in the field of sustainable development. The main objectives of the present review were to summarize, describe and synthesize available data about neuroendocrine control of testicular development, spermiation induction, seminal plasma characteristics and factors affecting sperm quality. In sturgeon, puberty usually occurs late in life and adult males do not spawn on an annual basis. Gonadal differentiation and spermatogonia proliferation occurs at 1-2 and 2-3 year-old, respectively. In spermatogenesis, environmental stimuli affect hypothalamus to release GnRH, which induce FSH release from pituitary stimulating testicular androgenesis, which is involved in spermatogonial proliferation and spermatogenesis. At spawning season, GnRH stimulates LH production from pituitary, regulating 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one production in testis, which control sperm maturation. In captivity, hormonal treatment is essential to induce spermiation. Chemical and biochemical compounds of the seminal plasma are important to protect viability, motility and fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa. Several kinds of acrosomal enzymes have been identified in sturgeon seminal plasma; higher concentrations reported in the frozen/thawed than fresh sperm suggesting their origination from spermatozoa. Moreover, there are numerous factors that influence on sperm quality including temperature, methods for spermiation induction, stripping frequency and stress.

However, multicollinearity between environmental variables can hinder the identification of key factors when water qualityenvironment relationship is studied using traditional regression methods. This study utilized two alternative statistical methods, variation and hierarchical partitioning, to address these difficulties in studies of river water quality. Using these methods, we explored the effects of catchment physiography, climate and land use variables on total phosphorus and nitrogen, pH, water colour and dissolved oxygen during the years 19952005 in 32 boreal rivers in Finland. Catchment physiography and land use explained most of the variation in water quality, especially in phosphorus, nitrogen and water colour data. The strong correlations (rs?>?0.8) between agricultural land use and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations indicate that water quality is highly affected by agriculture in boreal regions. By determining the environmental drivers of different water quality variables, we can estimate the water quality of different catchments in response to environmental changes and identify areas that are sensitive to global changes. Our study shows that novel statistical methods integrated with geographic information system data and techniques provide deeper insights into water qualityenvironment relationships than traditional regression, and these should be considered when developing, for example, conservation planning for rivers.

Mucosal integrity is maintained by the luminal redox status of the glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) and cysteine/cystine (Cys/CySS) couples which also support luminal nutrient absorption, mucus fluidity, and a diverse microbiota. The epithelial layer is uniquely organized for rapid self-renewal that is achieved by the well-regulated processes of crypt stem cell proliferation and crypt-to-villus cell differentiation. The GSH/GSSG and Cys/CySS redox couples, known to modulate intestinal cell transition through proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis, could govern the regenerative potential of the mucosa. These two couples, together with that of the thioredoxin/thioredoxin disulfide (Trx/TrxSS) couple are the major intracellular redox systems, and it is proposed that they each function as distinctive redox control nodes or circuitry in the control of metabolic processes and networks of enzymatic reactions. Specificity of redox signaling is accomplished in part by subcellular compartmentation of the individual redox systems within the mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol wherein each defined redox environment is suited to the specific metabolic function within that compartment. Mucosal oxidative stress would result from the disruption of these unique redox control nodes, and the subsequent alteration in redox signaling can contribute to the development of degenerative pathologies of the intestine, such as inflammation and cancer.

The fibrinogen genes (FGB-FGA-FGG) are expressed almost exclusively in hepatocytes where their output is coordinated to ensure a sufficient mRNA pool for each chain and maintain an abundant plasma fibrinogen protein level. Fibrinogen gene expression is controlled by the activity of proximal promoters which contain binding sites for hepatocyte transcription factors, including proteins which influence fibrinogen transcription in response to acute-phase inflammatory stimuli. The fibrinogen gene cluster also contains cis regulatory elements; enhancer sequences with liver activities identified by sequence conservation and functional genomics. While the transcriptional control of this gene cluster is fascinating biology, the medical impetus to understand fibrinogen gene regulation stems from the association of cardiovascular disease risk with high level circulating fibrinogen. In the general population this level varies from about 1.5 to 3.5 g/l. This variation between individuals is influenced by genotype, suggesting there are genetic variants contributing to fibrinogen levels which reside in fibrinogen regulatory loci. A complete picture of how fibrinogen genes are regulated will therefore point towards novel sources of regulatory variants. In this review we discuss regulation of the fibrinogen genes from proximal promoters and enhancers, the influence of acute-phase simulation, post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs and functional regulatory variants identified in genetic studies. Finally, we discuss the fibrinogen locus in light of recent advances in understanding chromosomal architecture and suggest future directions for researching the mechanisms that control fibrinogen expression.

In this review, we discuss the physiological basis of leaf-level responses to sunflecks and the mechanisms plants use to tolerate sudden changes in PFD and leaf temperature induced by sunflecks. We also examine the potential effects of climate change stresses (including elevated temperatures, rising CO2 concentrations and drought) on the ability of tree species to use sunflecks, and advocate more research to improve our predictions of seedling and tree carbon gain in future climates. Lastly, while we have the ability to model realistic responses of photosynthesis to fluctuating PFD, dynamic responses of photosynthesis to sunflecks are not accounted for in current models of canopy carbon uptake, which can lead to substantial overestimates of forest carbon fixation. Since sunflecks are a critical component of seasonal carbon gain for shaded leaves, sunfleck regimes and physiological responses to sunflecks should be incorporated into models to more accurately capture forest carbon dynamics.

Since the first documented case in 1954, sporadic cases and occasional outbreaks have been recorded with cases more consistently reported following the conflict in 1999. CCHF virus exists in enzootic cycles between wild animal species and ticks. The infection rates within ticks and hence the exposure to humans is determined by both the biology and seasonal dynamics of ticks, and the population dynamics and structure of the wild animals. These, in turn, are affected by complex interactions between climatic variables, changes in agricultural practices, land management, and wild animal density. If we are to understand the spatial and temporal occurrence of human disease, we must understand the ecology of the virus in nature.

The net growth rate of the tick populations increased in every scenario tested compared to the current climate baseline. These results support the expectations of increased tick survival and increased population turnover in future climate scenarios. We included a basic evaluation of host movement based on rules connected to altitude, slope, size of the near patches, and inter-patch distances in the real landscape over the target area. Data on landscape were obtained from medium-resolution MODIS satellite imagery, which allowed us to test the potential spread of the populations. Such a model of host dispersal linked to the process-driven life cycle model demonstrated that eastern (Turkey, Russia, and Balkans) populations of H. marginatum currently are well separated and have little mixing with western (Italy, Spain, and northern Africa) populations. The northern limit is marked by the cold areas in the Balkans, Alps, and Pyrenees. Under the warmer conditions predicted by the climate scenarios, the exchange of ticks throughout new areas, previously free of the vector, is expected to increase, mainly in the Balkans and southern Russia, over the limit of the mountain ranges.

Measurements of N2O flux were carried out on a weekly basis from April 2008 to August 2009 for a spring sown barley crop at Oak Park Research Centre, Carlow, Ireland. The soil was a free draining sandy loam typical of the majority of cereal growing land in Ireland. The aims of this study were to investigate the suitability of combining reduced tillage and a mustard cover crop (RT-CC) to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions from arable soils and to validate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model version (v. 9.2) for estimating N2O emissions. In addition, the model was used to simulate N2O emissions for two sets of future climate scenarios (period 2021-2060). Field results showed that although the daily emissions were significantly higher for RT-CC on two occasions (p < 0.05), no significant effect (p > 0.05) on the cumulative N2O flux, compared with the CT treatment, was found. DNDC was validated using N2O data collected from this study in combination with previously collected data and shown to be suitable for estimating N2O emissions (r (2) = 0.70), water-filled pore space (WFPS) (r (2) = 0.58) and soil temperature (r (2) = 0.87) from this field. The relative deviations of the simulated to the measured N2O values with the 140 kg N ha(-1) fertiliser application rate were -36 % for RT-CC and -19 % for CT. Root mean square error values were 0.014 and 0.007 kg N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively, indicating a reasonable fit. Future cumulative N2O fluxes and total denitrification were predicted to increase under the RT-CC management for all future climate projections, whilst predictions were inconsistent under the CT. Our study suggests that the use of RT-CC as an alternative farm management system for spring barley, if the sole objective is to reduce N2O emissions, may not be successful.

It yields an estimate of the number N of extraterrestrial communicating civilizations in the Galaxy given by the product N=Ns x fp x ne x fl x fi x fc x fL, where: Ns is the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy; fp is the fraction of stars that have planetary systems; ne is the number of planets in a given system that are ecologically suitable for life; fl is the fraction of otherwise suitable planets on which life actually arises; fi is the fraction of inhabited planets on which an intelligent form of life evolves; fc is the fraction of planets inhabited by intelligent beings on which a communicative technical civilization develops; and fL is the fraction of planetary lifetime graced by a technical civilization.The first three terms may be called ""the astrophysical terms"" in the Drake equation since their numerical value is provided by astrophysical considerations. The fourth term, fl, may be called ""the origin-of-life term"" and entails biology. The last three terms may be called ""the societal terms"" inasmuch as their respective numerical values are provided by anthropology, telecommunication science and ""futuristic science"", respectively.In this paper, we seek to provide a statistical estimate of the three societal terms in the Drake equation basing our calculations on the Statistical Drake Equation first proposed by this author at the 2008 IAC. In that paper the author extended the simple 7-factor product so as to embody Statistics. He proved that, no matter which probability distribution may be assigned to each factor, if the number of factors tends to infinity, then the random variable N follows the lognormal distribution (central limit theorem of Statistics). This author also proved at the 2009 IAC that the Dole (1964) [7] equation, yielding the number of Habitable Planets for Man in the Galaxy, has the same mathematical structure as the Drake equation. So the number of Habitable Planets follows the lognormal distribution as well. But the Dole equation is described by the first FOUR factors of the Drake equation. Thus, we may ""divide"" the 7-factor Drake equation by the 4-factor Dole equation getting the probability distribution of the last-3-factor Drake equation, i.e. the probability distribution of the SOCIETAL TERMS ONLY.

The transcension hypothesis proposes that a universal process of evolutionary development guides all sufficiently advanced civilizations into what may be called ""inner space,"" a computationally optimal domain of increasingly dense, productive, miniaturized, and efficient scales of space, time, energy, and matter, and eventually, to a black-hole-like destination. Transcension as a developmental destiny might also contribute to the solution to the Fermi paradox, the question of why we have not seen evidence of or received beacons from intelligent civilizations. A few potential evolutionary, developmental, and information theoretic reasons, mechanisms, and models for constrained transcension of advanced intelligence are briefly considered. In particular, we introduce arguments that black holes may be a developmental destiny and standard attractor for all higher intelligence, as they appear to some to be ideal computing, learning, forward time travel, energy harvesting, civilization merger, natural selection, and universe replication devices. In the transcension hypothesis, simpler civilizations that succeed in resisting transcension by staying in outer (normal) space would be developmental failures, which are statistically very rare late in the life cycle of any biological developing system. If transcension is a developmental process, we may expect brief broadcasts or subtle forms of galactic engineering to occur in small portions of a few galaxies, the handiwork of young and immature civilizations, but constrained transcension should be by far the norm for all mature civilizations.The transcension hypothesis has significant and testable implications for our current and future METI and SETI agendas. If all universal intelligence eventually transcends to black-hole-like environments, after which some form of merger and selection occurs, and if two-way messaging (a send-receive cycle) is severely limited by the great distances between neighboring and rapidly transcending civilizations, then sending one-way METI or probes prior to transcension becomes the only real communication option. But one-way messaging or probes may provably reduce the evolutionary diversity in all civilizations receiving the message, as they would then arrive at their local transcensions in a much more homogenous fashion. If true, an ethical injunction against one-way messaging or probes might emerge in the morality and sustainability systems of all sufficiently advanced civilizations, an argument known as the Zoo hypothesis in Fermi paradox literature, if all higher intelligences are subject to an evolutionary attractor to maximize their local diversity, and a developmental attractor to merge and advance universal intelligence. In any such environment, the evolutionary value of sending any interstellar message or probe may simply not be worth the cost, if transcension is an inevitable, accelerative, and testable developmental process, one that eventually will be discovered and quantitatively described by future physics. Fortunately, transcension processes may be measurable today even without good physical theory, and radio and optical SETI may each provide empirical tests.

It is however essential to develop high performance microbes that are capable of producing biofuels with very high efficiency in order to compete with the fossil fuel. Recently, the strategies for developing microbial strains by systems metabolic engineering, which can be considered as metabolic engineering integrated with systems biology and synthetic biology, have been developed. Systems metabolic engineering allows successful development of microbes that are capable of producing several different biofuels including bioethanol, biobutanol, alkane, and biodiesel, and even hydrogen. In this review, the approaches employed to develop efficient biofuel producers by metabolic engineering and systems metabolic engineering approaches are reviewed with relevant example cases. It is expected that systems metabolic engineering will be employed as an essential strategy for the development of microbial strains for industrial applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In habitats near the thermal range boundary, fluctuations in temperature may influence the ability of species to persist. Desert woodrats (Neotoma lepida Thomas, 1893) occupy one of the hottest and most extreme environments in the western hemisphere, Death Valley, California, despite limited adaptations for water conservation or efficient heat dissipation. Moreover, N. lepida have a relatively low tolerance for high temperature. Thus, we hypothesized temperature might influence both the timing and the duration of activity. To test this idea, we attached iButton sensors to 56 animals over a 2-year period and recorded activity. Each sensor was set to record at 5 or 15 min intervals and stored approximately 2000 records before retrieval. We found a strong relationship between ambient temperature and onset and duration of activity, influenced by both body size and gender. Neotoma lepida did not emerge until air temperature fell below 42 degrees C. As daily high temperatures increased, both sexes had fewer nightly activity bouts of shorter duration. Our results suggest that activity of N. lepida is constrained during the climatically intense summer months. Animals face a trade-off between remaining in the thermal safety of the den vs. emerging to obtain resources.

Recent studies demonstrate that a TF cistrome might differ among different organisms, tissue types and individuals. In a cell, a TF cistrome might differ among different physiological states, pathological stages and physiological and pathological conditions. It is, therefore, remarkable how highly plastic these binding profiles are, and how massively they can be reprogrammed in rapid response to intra/extracellular variations and during cell identity transitions and evolution. Biologically, cistrome reprogramming events tend to be followed by changes in transcriptional outputs, thus serving as transformative mechanisms to synchronically alter the biology of the cell. In this review, we discuss the molecular basis of cistrome plasticity and attempt to integrate the different mechanisms and biological conditions associated with cistrome reprogramming. Emerging data suggest that, when altered, these reprogramming events might be linked to tumor development and/or progression, which is a radical conceptual change in our mechanistic understanding of cancer and, potentially, other diseases.

This species reproduces from September to March, when ovigerous females are present and males construct their hoods. The monthly average air temperature fluctuates from 19.2 to 24.8 degrees C in this period. Hoods were constructed in accordance with the semilunar cycle of the breeding period; it lasted eight days, with the maximum frequency exactly on syzygy days (full or new moon). On a sunny full moon day in midsummer, males began to construct hoods 1.5 h after the substrate became exposed to the air, as the tide went out; the maximum density of hoods occurred after 3.5 h. The breeding patterns of most fiddler crabs of the world including U. leptodactyla are not determined by species-specific rules but by environmental conditions of the habitat, while other species respond in different manner to the same climatic conditions. Construction of hoods by males is a secure indication of the reproductive period of the fiddler crab U. leptodactyla from southern Brazil. The timing of hood construction within a day is similar to that in its consubgeneric species in spite of differences in local climatic conditions.

We collected the shrimps using minnow-traps in 12 first- and second-order streams in dry and rainy seasons.

Males were more abundant and larger than females in all species of Macrobrachium. All species had a few, large eggs. The abundance of M. nattereri was affected by stream size and temperature. The population structure of the studied species was different from those in other studies on shrimp populations in Central Amazonia and other regions of Brazil, indicating effects of sampling methods and the structure and size of water bodies on the population structure in different regions.

For example, NK cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells are capable of the direct engagement of infected cells and the mediation of antiviral responses. Both NK and CD8 T cells depend on common gamma chain (gamma c) cytokine signals for their development and homeostasis. The gamma c cytokine IL-15 is very well characterized for its role in promoting the development and homeostasis of NK cells and CD8 T cells, but emerging literature suggests that IL-15 mediates the anti-viral responses of these cell populations during an active immune response. Both NK cells and CD8 T cells must become activated, migrate to sites of infection, survive at those sites, and expand in order to maximally exert effector functions, and IL-15 can modulate each of these processes. This review focuses on the functions of IL-15 in the regulation of multiple aspects of NK and CD8 T cell biology, investigates the mechanisms by which IL-15 may exert such diverse functions, and discusses how these different facets of IL-15 biology may be therapeutically exploited to combat viral diseases.

Effective medical treatment for SSc is lacking because the etiology and pathogenesis of SSc are not fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, regulatory, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs that negatively modulate gene expression by either promoting the degradation of mRNA or down-regulating the protein production by translational repression. Among them, miRNA-29 is recently discovered as a class of miRNAs which is related to fibrotic disease. Numerous evidences have confirmed that miRNA-29 involved in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulated organ fibrosis. These findings revealed a potential and appealing role for miRNA-29 as SSc therapeutic targets.Areas covered: This review provides a comprehensive view on the biogenesis and functions of miRNAs. We also discuss the aberrant expression of miRNA-29 in SSc, and summarize current understanding of miRNA-29 involved in the process of fibrosis. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting miRNA-29 in SSc.Expert opinion: Although the exact pathogenesis of SSc still remains to be clarified, Targeting miRNA-29 may serve as a promising therapy strategy.

In order to investigate the biology of smoldering myeloma patients with high risk of progression, we analyzed the genomic characteristics by FISH, SNP-arrays and gene expression profile of a group of patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma included in a multicenter randomized trial. Chromosomal abnormalities detected by FISH and SNP-arrays at diagnosis were not associated to risk of progression to symptomatic myeloma. However, the overexpression of four SNORD genes (SNORD25, SNORD27, SNORD30 and SNORD31) was correlated with shorter time to progression (P<0.03). When plasma cells from high-risk smoldering patients who progressed to symptomatic myeloma were sequentially analyzed, newly acquired lesions together with an increase in the proportion of plasma cells carrying a given abnormality were observed. These findings suggest that gene expression profiling is a valuable technique to identify smoldering myeloma patients with high risk of progression.

This Bayesian approach with a prior based on the Gibbs distribution provides an efficient means to integrate multiple sources of biological data.

Identifying novel avenues for treating and preventing such pathologies is necessary and complicated by the complexity of interacting immune pathways in the gut, where effector and inflammatory immune cells are regulated by anti-inflammatory or regulatory cells. Here we present new advances in the development of the ENteric Immunity SImulator (ENISI), a simulator of GI immune mechanisms in response to resident commensal bacteria as well as invading pathogens and the effect on the development of intestinal lesions. ENISI is a tool for identifying potential treatment strategies that reduce inflammation-induced damage and, at the same time, ensure pathogen removal by allowing one to test plausibility of in vitro observed behavior as explanations for observations in vivo, propose behaviors not yet tested in vitro that could explain these tissue-level observations, and conduct low-cost, preliminary experiments of proposed interventions/treatments. An example of such application is shown in which we simulate dysentery resulting from Brachyispira hyodysenteriae infection and identify aspects of the host immune pathways that lead to continued inflammation-induced tissue damage even after pathogen elimination.

On recurrence, a repeat CRS/HIPEC is a treatment option.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of 868 CRS/HIPEC procedures was performed. Type of primary, functional status, completion of resection, hospitalization, morbidity, mortality, and survival were reviewed.RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (7.7%) underwent a second CRS/HIPEC, including 33 patients with appendiceal primaries, 8 ovarian, 7 mesotheliomas, 4 colon cancers, and 10 various malignancies. Median follow-up was 60.8 months. Median overall survival in months was 85.3 for appendiceal cancer, 52.9 for mesothelioma, 60.1 for ovarian, and 137.4 for colon cancer. R1 resection was achieved in 43.5% after both procedures. Median survival after the second cytoreduction was 52.1 months for appendiceal cancer, 21.8 for mesothelioma, 53.9 for ovarian, and 55.7 for colon cancer. Median survival was 55.7 months for R1 resection, 20.3 months for R2a resection, and 15.5 months for R2b-R2c. Median ICU and hospital stay was 1 and 7.5 days, respectively. The 30-day morbidity after the second CRS/HIPEC was 48.4% and mortality was 3.2%. In multivariate analysis, the R status of the second CRS/HIPEC (p = 0.013) and the interval between the 2 procedures (p = 0.009) were significant in predicting improved survival.CONCLUSIONS: In experienced tertiary centers and for selected patients, a repeat CRS/HIPEC procedure has morbidity and mortality similar to the initial cytoreduction. Survival depends primarily on the completion of the repeat cytoreduction and favorable biology of the tumor. (J Am Coll Surg 2012;215:412-417.

DNA replication allows for the faithful duplication of the genome, whereas DNA repair pathways preserve DNA integrity in response to damage originating from endogenous and exogenous sources.

Such a balance is important for maintaining viability while providing an opportunity for the advantageous selection of mutations when faced with a changing environment.

Among their most intriguing characteristics are their compartmentalized cell plan and archaeon-like cell wall. Here we review our current knowledge about anammox cell biology. The anammox cell is divided into three separate compartments by bilayer membranes. The anammox cell consists of (from outside to inside) the cell wall, paryphoplasm, riboplasm, and anammoxosome. Not much is known about the composition or function of both the anammox cell wall and the paryphoplasm compartment. The cell wall is proposed to be proteinaceous and to lack both peptidoglycan and an outer membrane typical of Gram-negative bacteria. The function of the paryphoplasm is unknown, but it contains the cell division ring. The riboplasm resembles the standard cytoplasmic compartment of other bacteria; it contains ribosomes and the nucleoid. The anammoxosome occupies most of the cell volume and is a so-called ""prokaryotic organelle"" analogous to the eukaryotic mitochondrion. This is the site where the anammox reaction takes place, coupled over the curved anammoxosome membrane, possibly giving rise to a proton motive force and subsequent ATP synthesis.

By focusing on events in a single clonal population undergoing a single transition, we discuss how environmental cues and changes in growth rate initiate a multiplicity of adaptive pathways. Adaptation is a comprehensive process, and stochastic, regulatory, epigenetic, and mutational changes can contribute to fitness and overlap in timing and frequency. We identify culture history as a major determinant of both regulatory adaptations and microevolutionary change. Population history before a transition determines heterogeneities due to errors in translation, stochastic differences in regulation, the presence of aged, damaged, cheating, or dormant cells, and variations in intracellular metabolite or regulator concentrations. It matters whether bacteria come from dense, slow-growing, stressed, or structured states. Genotypic adaptations are history dependent due to variations in mutation supply, contingency gene changes, phase variation, lateral gene transfer, and genome amplifications. Phenotypic adaptations underpin genotypic changes in situations such as stress-induced mutagenesis or prophage induction or in biofilms to give a continuum of adaptive possibilities. Evolutionary selection additionally provides diverse adaptive outcomes in a single transition and generally does not result in single fitter types. The totality of heterogeneities in an adapting population increases the chance that at least some individuals meet immediate or future challenges. However, heterogeneity complicates the adaptomics of single transitions, and we propose that subpopulations will need to be integrated into future population biology and systems biology predictions of bacterial behavior.

Mature a-factor is derived from a precursor with a C-terminal CAAX motif that directs a series of posttranslational reactions, including prenylation, endoproteolysis, and carboxylmethylation. Historically, a-factor has served as a valuable model for the discovery and functional analysis of CAAX-processing enzymes. In this review, we discuss the three modules comprising the a-factor biogenesis pathway: (i) the C-terminal CAAX-processing steps carried out by Ram1/Ram2, Ste24 or Rce1, and Ste14; (ii) two sequential N-terminal cleavage steps, mediated by Ste24 and Axl1; and (iii) export by a nonclassical mechanism, mediated by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter Ste6. The small size and hydrophobicity of a-factor present both challenges and advantages for biochemical analysis, as discussed here. The enzymes involved in a-factor biogenesis are conserved from yeasts to mammals. Notably, studies of the zinc metalloprotease Ste24 in S. cerevisiae led to the discovery of its mammalian homolog ZMPSTE24, which cleaves the prenylated C-terminal tail of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A. Mutations that alter ZMPSTE24 processing of lamin A in humans cause the premature-aging disease progeria and related progeroid disorders. Intriguingly, recent evidence suggests that the entire a-factor pathway, including all three biogenesis modules, may be used to produce a prenylated, secreted signaling molecule involved in germ cell migration in Drosophila. Thus, additional prenylated signaling molecules resembling a-factor, with as-yet-unknown roles in metazoan biology, may await discovery.

We used affinity purification of protein complexes coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to generate a high-resolution protein interaction map of the three homologous p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in Drosophila and assessed the utility of such a map in defining the extent of common and unique functions. We found a correlation between the depth of integration of individual p38 kinases into the protein interaction network and their functional significance in cultured cells and in vivo. Based on these data, we propose a central role of p38b in the Drosophila p38 signaling module, with p38a and p38c playing more peripheral, auxiliary roles. We also present the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that an evolutionarily conserved complex of p38b with glycogen synthase links stress sensing to metabolic adaptation.

In addition to known xyloglucan biosynthetic genes, a previously uncharacterized putative xyloglucan galactosyltransferase was identified. Analysis of an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant line defective in the corresponding ortholog (AT5G62220) revealed that this gene shows no redundancy with the previously characterized xyloglucan galactosyltransferase, MUR3, but is required for galactosyl-substitution of xyloglucan at a different position. The gene was termed XLT2 for Xyloglucan L-side chain galactosylTransferase position 2. It represents an enzyme in the same subclade of glycosyltransferase family 47 as MUR3. A double mutant defective in both MUR3 (mur3.1) and XLT2 led to an Arabidopsis plant with xyloglucan that consists essentially of only xylosylated glucosyl units, with no further substitutions.

Although some genes were reported to be involved in anther development, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of these genes is unclear. lfr-2 (leaf and flower related-2), the null allele of Arabidopsis thaliana LFR (LEAF AND FLOWER RELATED), was male-sterile. The anthers of lfr-2 plants were defective in sporogenous cell formation, tapetum development, and pollen development. In agreement with these phenotypes, expression studies showed that LFR was expressed in all cell layers of the anther, and that expression was particularly strong in the tapetal cells and pollen grains. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that LFR is required for the normal transcription of some anther development-related genes, such as AMS, CALS5, and DYT1, MS1 and MS2, and ROXY2. Genetic analysis showed that SPL was epistatic to LFR while LFR was epistatic to DYT1. We propose that LFR may be a crucial component in the regulation of a genetic network that modulates anther development.

We analyzed the monocyte proteome for potential markers that would enhance the ability to screen for early inflammatory status in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using proteomic technologies. Monocytic cells (THP-1) were primed with high glucose (HG), their protein profiles were analyzed using 2DE and the downregulated differentially expressed spots were identified using MALDI TOF/MS. We selected five proteins that were secretory in function with the help of bioinformatic programs. A predominantly downregulated protein identified as cyclophilin A (sequence coverage 98%) was further validated by immunoblotting experiments. The cellular mRNA levels of cyclophilin A in various HG-primed cells were studied using qRT-PCR assays and it was observed to decrease in a dose-dependent manner. LC-ESI-MS was used to identify this protein in the conditioned media of HG-primed cells and confirmed by Western blotting as well as ELISA. Cyclophilin A was also detected in the plasma of patients with diabetes. We conclude that cyclophilin A is secreted by monocytes in response to HG. Given the paracrine and autocrine actions of cyclophilin A, the secreted immunophilin could be significant for progression of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes. Our study also provides evidence that analysis of monocyte secretome is a viable strategy for identifying candidate plasma markers in diabetes.

We examined the effect of nanoscale matrix anisotropy on EC organization and migration for vascular tissue engineering applications. Materials & methods: We developed a flow processing technique to generate anisotropic nanofibrillar collagen. Human ECs were cultured on aligned or on randomly oriented collagen, and their cellular alignment and cytoskeletal organization were characterized by immunofluorescence staining and time-lapse microscopy. Results: ECs were elongated along the direction of aligned collagen nanofibrils and had organized focal adhesions. Cellular protrusion migrated with greater directionality and higher velocity along the anisotropic nanofibrils compared with cells on random nanofibrils. The flow technique can be adapted to fabricate vascular grafts that support the endothelial phenotype. Conclusion: Aligned nanofibrillar collagen regulates EC organization and migration, which can significantly contribute to the development of vascular grafts.

Hermaphroditic flower exhibited protogynous dichogamy as stigma became receptive a day before anther dehiscence. Flowers produce moderately high number (16,280 +/- 324) of spherical and medium size (98.6 mu m x 87.3 mu m) pollen with pollen/ovule ratio of 120.6. Nitidulid beetles; Carpophilos domidiatus and Carpophilos hemipterous were identified as pollinators in terms of visitation frequency, pollination potential index score and pollination efficiency. However C. hemipterous was relatively effective pollinator than C. domidiatus. Floral traits and specific reward system of A. squamosa clearly exhibit obligate specialization by filtering only C. hemipterous and C. domidiatus as pollinators and thereby explicitly indicating canthrophilous pollination syndrome.

In this study, the life history of this species was studied in Mar del Plata harbour (Argentina), a fully marine area where a stable and dense population has been established. Growth, sex proportion, morphological relationships, size at maturity and reproductive cycle were analysed between March 2007 and March 2009. A total of 9 and 7 modal classes (M1-M9) were detected in the size frequency distributions of females and males, respectively. The modes of both sexes were the same until M4 but from M5 to M7 females were larger than males. The life span was about one year with a clear seasonal growth. Recruitment and reproductive periods were recorded from December to March and October to March, respectively. The total sex ratio was biased to females. Nevertheless, a clear predominance of males was observed in classes smaller than 5.25 mm carapace length (CL). Females reached maturity at a larger size in spring to early summer (October-January) than in late summer (February-March); the estimated sizes for 50% sexual maturity were 6.79 mm and 5.91 mm CL, respectively. The results showed great differences from a presumably native estuarine population (Japan), such as shorter life span, smaller maximum size and smaller size at maturity.

In this article, we investigate (i) the evolution that this newly developed trawl shrimp fishery may undergo when subjected to different management measures, and (ii) the most suitable extraction rates considering the uncertainties about the resource. We further analyse the effects that potential future fuel price increases and changes in the market may have on the fishery. Forecasting the biological and economic consequences of management actions, as well as the effects of market changes on inputs and outputs before they are applied, may help managers select the most suitable management options. We approach the problem by means of bio-economic simulation analysis.

The paper offers a novel approach to assess the impact of GxE and rGE on the way genetic and environmental causation can be partitioned. A probabilistic framework is developed, based on a quantitative genetic model that incorporates GxE and rGE, offering a rigorous way of interpreting heritability estimates. Specifically, given an estimate of heritability and the variance components associated with estimates of GxE and rGE, I arrive at a probabilistic account of the relative effect of genes and environment.

In current orthodox theory, this diverse range of population behaviors is described by many different equations-each with its own specific justification. Here, a single equation governing all the regimes is proposed together with the principle from which it derives. The principle is: The effect on the environment of a population's success is to alter that environment in a way that opposes the success.

Floquet theory is a mathematical tool to deal with such time periodic systems. It is not often applied in biology, because linkage between the mathematics and the biology is not available. To create this linkage, we derive the Floquet theory for natural systems. We construct a framework, where the rotation of the Earth is causing the periodicity. Within this framework the angular momentum operator is introduced to describe the Earth's rotation. The Fourier operators and the Fourier states are defined to link the rotation to the biological system. Using these operators, the biological system can be transformed into a rotating frame in which the environment becomes static. In this rotating frame the Floquet solution can be derived. Two examples demonstrate how to apply this natural framework. ", Mathematical & Computational Biology 10.1152/advan.00108.2011,How much structuring is beneficial with regard to examination scores?

A prospective study of three forms of active learning. Adv Physiol Educ 36: 207-212, 2012; doi: 10.1152/advan.00108.2011.-Many studies have demonstrated a superiority of active learning forms compared with traditional lecture. However, there is still debate as to what degree structuring is necessary with regard to high exam outcomes. Seventy-five students from a premedical school were randomly attributed to an active lecture group, a cooperative group, or a collaborative learning group. The active lecture group received lectures with questions to resolve at the end of the lecture. At the same time, the cooperative group and the collaborative group had to work on a problem and prepare presentations for their answers. The collaborative group worked in a mostly self-directed manner; the cooperative group had to follow a time schedule. For the additional work of preparing the poster presentation, the collaborative and cooperative groups were allowed 50% more working time. In part 1, all groups worked on the citric acid cycle, and in part 2, all groups worked on molecular genetics. Collaborative groups had to work on tasks and prepare presentations for their answers. At the end of each part, all three groups were subjected to the same exam. Additionally, in the collaborative and cooperative groups, the presentations were marked. All evaluations were performed by two independent examiners. Exam results of the active lecture groups were highest. Results of the cooperative group were nonsignificantly lower than the active lecture group and significantly higher than the collaborative group. The presentation quality was nonsignificantly higher in the collaborative group compared with the cooperative group. This study shows that active lecturing produced the highest exam results, which significantly differed from collaborative learning results. The additional elaboration in the cooperative and collaborative learning setting yielded the high presentation quality but apparently could not contribute further to exam scores. Cooperative learning seems to be a good compromise if high exam and presentation scores are expected.

Cancers arising in serrated lesions are usually in the proximal colon, and account for a disproportionate fraction of cancer identified after colonoscopy. We sought to provide guidance for the clinical management of serrated colorectal lesions based on current evidence and expert opinion regarding definitions, classification, and significance of serrated lesions. A consensus conference was held over 2 days reviewing the topic of serrated lesions from the perspectives of histology, molecular biology, epidemiology, clinical aspects, and serrated polyposis. Serrated lesions should be classified pathologically according to the World Health Organization criteria as hyperplastic polyp, sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P) with or without cytological dysplasia, or traditional serrated adenoma (TSA). SSA/P and TSA are premalignant lesions, but SSA/P is the principal serrated precursor of CRCs. Serrated lesions have a distinct endoscopic appearance, and several lines of evidence suggest that on average they are more difficult to detect than conventional adenomatous polyps. Effective colonoscopy requires an endoscopist trained in the endoscopic appearance of serrated lesions. We recommend that all serrated lesions proximal to the sigmoid colon and all serrated lesions in the rectosigmoid >5 mm in size, be completely removed. Recommendations are made for post-polypectomy surveillance of serrated lesions and for surveillance of serrated polyposis patients and their relatives.

The generation of a large sequence database has facilitated studies of the evolution and spread of the virus. Bayesian analyses indicate that currently circulating strains of RVFV are descended from an ancestral species that emerged from a natural reservoir in Africa when large-scale cattle and sheep farming were introduced during the 19th century. Viruses descended from multiple lineages persist in that region, through infection of reservoir animals and vertical transmission in mosquitoes, emerging in years of heavy rainfall to cause epizootics and epidemics. On a number of occasions, viruses from these lineages have been transported outside the enzootic region through the movement of infected animals or mosquitoes, triggering outbreaks in countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mauritania and Madagascar, where RVF had not previously been seen. Such viruses could potentially become established in their new environments through infection of wild and domestic ruminants and other animals and vertical transmission in local mosquito species. Despite their extensive geographic dispersion, all strains of RVFV remain closely related at the nucleotide and amino acid level. The high degree of conservation of genes encoding the virion surface glycoproteins suggests that a single vaccine should protect against all currently circulating RVFV strains. Similarly, preservation of the sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase across viral lineages implies that antiviral drugs targeting the enzyme should be effective against all strains. Researchers should be encouraged to collect additional RVFV isolates and perform whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, so as to enhance our understanding of the continuing evolution of this important virus.

During embryogenesis and in vivo stem cell differentiation, cells/tissues deploy epigenetic mechanisms to accomplish differentiation and give rise to the fully developed organism. Although a biochemistry description of cellular genetics and epigenetics is important, additional mechanisms are necessary to completely solve the problem of embryogenesis, especially differentiation and the spatiotemporal coordination of cells/tissues during morphogenesis. The cell state splitter and differentiation wave working-model was initially proposed to explain the homeostatic primary neural induction in amphibian embryos. Here the model is adopted to explain experimental findings on in vitro embryonic stem cell, pluripotency and differentiation. Moreover, since somatic cells can be reverted to a stem-cell-like pluripotent state through the laboratory procedure called epigenetic reprogramming, erection of a cell state splitter could be a key event in their successful reprogramming. Overall, the cell state splitter working-model introduces a bistable cytoskeletal mechanism that partially explains cell fate determination and biological development.

In the field of developmental biology, concerns about morphogenesis canalization are often framed as the French flag problem, questioning how each cell knows its own position in the whole system. Although chemical gradients have been suggested to provide positional information, there is no direct evidence that gradients are used to gain positional information. The chemical gradient hypothesis is based on the assumption that agents (e.g., cells) in a domain that locally interact with each other can generate a chemical gradient thanks to a global reference point. Instead of a chemical gradient, we here propose a model based on agents that are equipped with sociality that is based not on a global reference but rather on the ability to sense other neighboring agents, or potential resonance. The interaction among the agents with sociality, developed from undifferentiated types or tokens, is implemented using asynchronous updating automata equipped with potential resonance. We show that these automata can generate a French flag pattern that is very robust against perturbations without positional information by comparing automata with synchronous updating and asynchronous automata without potential resonance.

We give a brief overview of the field of developmental cognitive psychology.

These may be in the form of misconceptions, biases, or simply concepts that are difficult to learn and teach, and they occur at all levels of biological analysis (molecular, cellular, organismal, population, and ecosystem). We then introduce the notion of a cognitive construal and discuss specific examples of how these cognitive principles may explain what makes some misconceptions so alluring and some biological concepts so challenging for undergraduates. We will argue that seemingly unrelated misconceptions may have common origins in a single underlying cognitive construal. These ideas emerge from our own ongoing cross-disciplinary conversation, and we think that expanding this conversation to include other biological scientists and educators, as well as other cognitive scientists, could have significant utility in improving biology teaching and learning.

We use qualitative and quantitative methods to describe students' definitions, identify common misconceptions, and examine differences before and after instruction on genetic drift. We identify and describe five overarching categories that include 16 distinct misconceptions about genetic drift. The accuracy of students' conceptions ranges considerably, from responses indicating only superficial, if any, knowledge of any aspect of evolution to responses indicating knowledge of genetic drift but confusion about the nuances of genetic drift. After instruction, a significantly greater number of responses indicate some knowledge of genetic drift (p = 0.005), but 74.6% of responses still contain at least one misconception. We conclude by presenting a framework that organizes how students' conceptions of genetic drift change with instruction. We also articulate three hypotheses regarding undergraduates' conceptions of evolution in general and genetic drift in particular. We propose that: 1) students begin with undeveloped conceptions of evolution that do not recognize different mechanisms of change; 2) students develop more complex, but still inaccurate, conceptual frameworks that reflect experience with vocabulary but still lack deep understanding; and 3) some new misconceptions about genetic drift emerge as students comprehend more about evolution.

The fast pace, high enrollment, and high stakes of introductory science courses, however, limit students' opportunities to self-assess and modify learning strategies. The University of Washington's Biology Fellows Program (BFP) intervenes through a 20-session, premajors course that introduces students to the rigor expected of bioscience majors and assists their development as science learners. This study uses quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess whether the 2007-2009 BFP achieved its desired short- and long-term impacts on student learning. Adjusting for differences in students' high school grade point average and Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, we found that participation in the BFP was associated with higher grades in two subsequent gateway biology courses, across multiple quarters and instructors. Two to 4 yr after participating in the program, students attributed changes in how they approached learning science to BFP participation. They reported having learned to ""think like a scientist"" and to value active-learning strategies and learning communities. In addition, they reported having developed a sense of belonging in bioscience communities. The achievement of long-term impacts for a short-term instructional investment suggests a practical means to prepare diverse students for the rigors of science curricula.

Automated Analysis of Student Writing about Acid-Base Chemistry in Introductory Biology","Abstract: Students' writing can provide better insight into their thinking than can multiple-choice questions. However, resource constraints often prevent faculty from using writing assessments in large undergraduate science courses. We investigated the use of computer software to analyze student writing and to uncover student ideas about chemistry in an introductory biology course. Students were asked to predict acid-base behavior of biological functional groups and to explain their answers. Student explanations were rated by two independent raters. Responses were also analyzed using SPSS Text Analysis for Surveys and a custom library of science-related terms and lexical categories relevant to the assessment item. These analyses revealed conceptual connections made by students, student difficulties explaining these topics, and the heterogeneity of student ideas. We validated the lexical analysis by correlating student interviews with the lexical analysis. We used discriminant analysis to create classification functions that identified seven key lexical categories that predict expert scoring (interrater reliability with experts = 0.899). This study suggests that computerized lexical analysis may be useful for automatically categorizing large numbers of student open-ended responses. Lexical analysis provides instructors unique insights into student thinking and a whole-class perspective that are difficult to obtain from multiple-choice questions or reading individual responses.

This study tested the effect of exam format on critical-thinking skills. Multiple-choice (MC) testing is common in introductory science courses, and students in these classes tend to associate memorization with MC questions and may not see the need to modify their study strategies for critical thinking, because the MC exam format has not changed. To test the effect of exam format, I used two sections of an introductory biology class. One section was assessed with exams in the traditional MC format, the other section was assessed with both MC and constructed-response (CR) questions. The mixed exam format was correlated with significantly more cognitively active study behaviors and a significantly better performance on the cumulative final exam (after accounting for grade point average and gender). There was also less gender-bias in the CR answers. This suggests that the MC-only exam format indeed hinders critical thinking in introductory science classes. Introducing CR questions encouraged students to learn more and to be better critical thinkers and reduced gender bias. However, student resistance increased as students adjusted their perceptions of their own critical-thinking abilities.

Here, we present the crystal structure of ISG54, an ISG56 family protein with a novel RNA-binding structure. The structure shows that ISG54 monomers have 9 tetratricopeptide repeat-like motifs and associate to form domain-swapped dimers. The C-terminal part folds into a super-helical structure and has an extensively positively-charged nucleotide-binding channel on its inner surface. EMSA results show that ISG54 binds specifically to some RNAs, such as adenylate uridylate (AU)-rich RNAs, with or without 5' triphosphorylation. Mutagenesis and functional studies show that this RNA-binding ability is important to its antiviral activity. Our results suggest a new mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of this interferon-inducible gene 56 family member.

They may also form the basis of tissue engineering scaffolds, as these can direct cell adhesion and migration and promote new matrix synthesis. To better understand cell-matrix interactions on attractive gradients, we have used multiphoton excited (MPE) photochemistry to fabricate covalently linked micro-structured gradients from fibronectin (FN). The gradient design is comprised of a parallel series of individual linear gradients with overall dimensions of approximately 800 x 800 A mu m, where a linear dynamic range of nearly 10-fold in concentration was achieved. The adhesion dynamics of 3T3 fibroblasts were investigated, where the cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton became increasingly elongated and aligned with the direction of the gradient at increasing protein concentration. Moreover, the cell morphologies are distinct when adhered to regions of differing FN concentration but with similar topography. These results show that the fabrication approach allows investigating the roles of contact guidance and ECM cues on the cell-matrix interactions. We suggest this design overcomes some of the limitations with other fabrication methods, especially in terms of 3D patterning capabilities, and will serve as a new tool to study cell-matrix interactions.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms of the left-right asymmetry have been extensively investigated in the past decade and the developmental mechanisms of the syndrome have been considerably elucidated. Medical and surgical management and treatment of heterotaxy syndrome have advanced as well. However, prognosis of the disease still remains unsatisfactory because the syndrome is often associated with a combination of complicated congenital heart diseases. Management of heterotaxy patients, particularly those who have undergone the Fontan procedure, is now one of the most important issues in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease clinics.

Nonpolypoid lesions >= 20 mm, whether sessile or flat and laterally spreading, are forms of advanced mucosal neoplasia that cannot be managed by conventional polypectomy and are often referred for surgery. However, the majority of these lesions when carefully assessed are found to be noninvasive and can be safely and effectively treated by advanced endoscopic techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection with resultant cost, morbidity, and mortality benefits. Lesion assessment is a critical component. Enhanced imaging methods provide the opportunity for accurate pathological characterization, informing treatment decisions, without the need for previous histologic confirmation. Techniques of advanced endoscopic resection are still in evolution and further improvements, including hybrid techniques, bringing less technically challenging and shorter procedures with superior safety can be reasonably expected in the next decade. Safety is a fundamental consideration. Methods of early recognition of complications, risk stratification, and management pathways are being developed and refined. Standardization, validation, and adoption of these technological developments will improve endoscopic interpretation and therapy and in combination with an increased understanding of adenoma molecular biology, will result in a progressively more individualized lesion-specific endoscopic approach. The future of advanced endoscopic resection in the colon is promising, and the next few years should see the boundaries of endoscopic resection expand well beyond the limits of what we know today.

We developed a new orthotopic animal model to determine the technical feasibility of axial arteriovenous bundle implantation and resultant angiogenesis.We asked whether arteriovenous bundles implanted in segmental allografts would increase cortical blood flow and angiogenesis compared to nonrevascularized frozen bone allografts and contralateral femoral controls.We performed segmental femoral allotransplantation orthotopically from 10 Brown Norway rats to 20 Lewis rats. Ten rats each received either bone allograft reconstruction alone (Group I) or allograft combined with an intramedullary saphenous arteriovenous flap (Group II). At 16 weeks, we measured cortical blood flow with the hydrogen washout method. We then quantified angiogenesis using capillary density and micro-CT vessel volume measurements.All arteriovenous bundles were patent. Group II had higher mean blood flow (0.12 mL/minute/100 g versus 0.05 mL/minute/100 g), mean capillary density (23.6% versus 2.8%), and micro-CT vessel volume (0.37 mm(3) versus 0.07 mm(3)) than Group I. Revascularized allografts had higher capillary density than untreated contralateral femora, while vessel volume did not differ and blood flow was lower.Axial surgical revascularization in orthotopic allotransplants can achieve strong angiogenesis and increases cortical bone blood flow.Poor allograft revascularization results in frequent complications of nonunion, infection, and late stress fracture. The presented technique of surgical revascularization could therefore offer a beneficial adjunct to clinical segmental bone allografting.

The storage and reuse of complex biodiversity data in central databases are becoming increasingly important, particularly in attempts to cope with the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystems. From the data side, the main challenge of biodiversity repositories is to deal with the highly interdisciplinary and heterogeneous character of standardized and unstandardized data and metadata covering information from genes to ecosystems. Furthermore, the technical improvements in data acquisition techniques produce ever larger data volumes, which represent a challenge for database structure and proper data exchange.The current study is based on comprehensive in-depth interviews and an online survey addressing IT specialists involved in database development and operation. The results show that metadata are already well established, but that non-meta data still is largely unstandardized across various scientific communities. For example, only a third of all repositories in our investigation use internationally unified semantic standard checklists for taxonomy. The study also showed that database developers are mostly occupied with the implementation of state of the art technology and solving operational problems, leaving no time to implement user's requirements. One of the main reasons for this dissatisfying situation is the undersized and unreliable funding situation of most repositories, as reflected by the marginally small number of permanent IT staff members. We conclude that a sustainable data management system that fosters the future use and reuse of these valuable data resources requires the development of fewer, but more permanent data repositories using commonly accepted standards for their long-term data. This can only be accomplished through the consolidation of hitherto widely scattered small and non-permanent repositories. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

Of interest here is the recent shift in focus from genetic to epigenetic/epigenomic research and the emergence and extension of resource provision to support this both at local and global scale. Biomedical text and numerical data mining are both considered, the first dealing with automated methods for analyzing research content and information extraction, and the second (broadly) with pattern recognition and prediction. Any summary and selection of resources is inherently limited, given the spectrum available, but the aim is to provide a guideline for the assessment and comparison of currently available provision, particularly as this relates to epigenetics/epigenomics.

Yunnan Province in China is a rich source of wild mushrooms and has experienced a temperature rise over recent decades. This has resulted in warmer temperatures but the impacts of these changes on mushroom production lack documentation. We collected data on the fruiting of the highly prized matsutake mushroom (Tricholoma matsutake) in West Yunnan, China over an 11 year period from 2000 to 2010. Fruiting phenology and productivity were compared against the driving meteorological variables using Projection to Latent Structure regression. The mushrooms appeared later in the season during the observation period, which is most likely explained by rising temperatures and reduced rain during May and June. High temperature and abundant rain in August resulted in good productivity. The climate response of matsutake production results from a sequence of processes that are possibly linked with regulatory signals and resource availability. To advance the knowledge of this complex system, a holistic research approach integrating biology, ecology, genetics, physiology, and phytochemistry is needed. Our results contribute to a general model of fungal ecology, which can be used to predict the responses of fungi to global climate change.

Most recently, SAMHD1 has been shown to be one of these factors. SAMHD1 is a nucleus-localized protein, and mutations in the gene are associated with Alcardi-Goutieres syndrome. As a triphosphohydrolase, it depletes the intracellular pool of dNTPs in myeloid cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, to a low level that establishes a precursor-deficient environment for the synthesis of lentiviral cDNA, thereby restricting viral replication in these host cells. However, some viruses evolve Vpx to recruit SAMHD1 onto the CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase in the cytoplasm for proteasome-dependent degradation, by which these viruses relieve SAMHD1-mediated restriction of primate lentivirus infection. In this review, we describe the latest knowledge of SAMHD1 biology.

A great deal of evidence has pointed to the role of adipokines and innate immune cells, in particular, adipose tissue macrophages, in the regulation of fat inflammation and glucose homeostasis. However, more recently, cells of the adaptive immune system, specifically B and T lymphocytes, have emerged as unexpected promoters and controllers of insulin resistance. These adaptive immune cells infiltrate obesity expanded VAT and through cytokine secretion and macrophage modulation dictate the extent of the local inflammatory response, thereby directly impacting insulin resistance. The remarkable ability of our adaptive immune system to regulate insulin sensitivity and metabolism has unmasked a novel physiological function of this system, and promises new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to manage the disease.

Transmission is largely via blood-to-blood contact. Following primary infection, a minority of individuals clear the infection predominantly via cellular immune mechanisms, whereas the majority become chronically infected. Recent data suggest that a third outcome may also be possible, termed 'occult' infection in which subjects who are known, or suspected to have previously been infected with HCV, no longer have viral RNA in their serum at levels detectable by sensitive commercial assays, but do have virus detected by ultra-sensitive techniques. Occult infection has also been detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which may indicate an extra-hepatic reservoir of the virus. Although the clinical significance of occult infection remains unknown, most authors have raised concerns of recrudescent infection. Here we critically review the published literature, suggest further avenues of investigation and propose that occult infection may be beneficial to the host by maintaining immunological memory to protect against reinfection.

To overcome the impediment of high homology among each of the sets, we designed a quantitative real-time PCR assay that incorporates the use of molecular beacon and locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes, and in some instances, LNA oligonucleotide inhibitors. We then measured IFN subtype expression by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and by purified monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and -dendritic cells (MDDC) in response to poly I:C, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), imiquimod and CpG oligonucleotides. We found that in response to poly I: C and LPS, monocytes, MDM and MDDC express a subtype pattern restricted primarily to IFN-beta and IFN-lambda 1. In addition, while CpG elicited expression of all type I IFN subtypes by pDC, imiquimod did not. Furthermore, MDM and mDC highly express IFN-lambda, and the subtypes of IFN-lambda are expressed hierarchically in the order IFN-lambda 1 followed by IFN-lambda 2, and then IFN-lambda 3. These data support a model of coordinated cell- and ligand-specific expression of types I and III IFN. Defining IFN subtype expression profiles in a variety of contexts may elucidate specific roles for IFN subtypes as protective, therapeutic or pathogenic mediators.

Here we showed that EC immunization of normal mice with 2,4-dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) applied on the skin in the form of a patch induces a state of subsequent unresponsiveness due to regulatory T cells (Treg) that inhibited sensitization and elicitation of effector T-cell responses. Suppression is transferable in vivo by TCR alpha beta(+) CD4(+) CD25(+) lymphocytes harvested from lymph nodes (LNs) of skin-patched animals. Flow cytometry revealed that EC immunization with DNP-BSA increased TCR alpha beta(+) CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) lymphocytes in subcutaneous LNs, suggesting that observed suppression was mediated by Treg cells. Further, in vitro experiments showed that EC immunization with DNP-BSA prior to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzen sensitization suppressed LN cell proliferation and inhibited production of TNF-alpha, IL-12 and IFN-gamma. Using a transwell system or anti-CTLA-4 mAb, we found that EC induced suppression required direct Treg-effector cell contact and is CTLA-4-dependent.

In the present study, the role of PMN-II on the production of human beta-defensins (HBDs), important molecules on host antimicrobial innate immunities, by human keratinocytes was studied. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were cultured with neutrophils (PMNs) isolated from burn patients or healthy volunteers in dual-chamber transwells. Culture fluids harvested 24 h after cultivation were assayed for HBDs using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Also, these culture fluids were assayed for their antimicrobial activities by a standard colony-counting method using Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the results, PMNs isolated from peripheral blood of burn patients were confirmed as PMN-II, because these cells produced CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), but not interleukin (IL)-12 and CC-chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3). Culture fluids of NHEK transwell-cultured with healthy PMNs exhibited strong killing activities against P. aeruginosa (96% inhibition), however, the growth of bacteria was not dramatically inhibited by the culture fluids of NHEK transwell-cultured with burn-patient PMNs (36% inhibition). IL-12 and CCL3 containing culture fluids of healthy PMNs stimulated with the bacterial antigen or rCCL3 and rIL-12 enhanced the production of HBD2 and HBD3 by NHEK, whereas CCL2 containing culture fluids of burn-patient PMN stimulated with the antigen or rCCL2 inhibited the HBD production by NHEK. These results indicate that PMN-II appearing in association with burn injury contribute to the decreased production of HBDs in thermally injured patients.

Deciphering the signals that induce IL-21 production in CD4(+) T cells and those triggered by IL-21 in B cells are, therefore, of importance for understanding the generation of antibody (Ab) responses. Here, we show that IL-6 increased IL-21 production by human CD4(+) T cells, particularly in those that express the transcriptional regulator B cell lymphoma (BCL) 6, which is required in mice for the development of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5(+)) IL-21-producing T follicular helper (T-FH) cells. However, retroviral overexpression of BCL6 in total human CD4(+) T cells only transiently increased CXCR5, the canonical T-FH-defining surface marker. We show here that IL-21 was required for the induction of Ab production by IL-6. In IL-21-treated B cells, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 was required for optimal immunoglobulin production and upregulation of PR domain containing 1 (PRDM1(+)), the master plasma cell factor. These results, therefore, demonstrate the critical importance of STAT3 activation in B cells during IL-21-driven humoral immunity and suggest that BCL6 expression, although not sufficient, may serve as a platform for the acquisition of a T-FH-like phenotype by human CD4(+) T cells.

The contribution of Treg to the prevention of autoimmunity and the maintenance of immune homoestasis is the subject of ongoing interest, as alterations in Treg numbers and function are implicated in a wide range of diseases. The in vitro benchmark for determining Treg function is suppression of proliferation of unmatched effector T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) over a 3-6-day time period. As an alternative to this assay, we show that a 7-h CD154 expression assay is rapid, simple and provides a reliable readout of suppressor function. Using multiple Treg-like cell types including natural (n)Treg, inducible (i)Treg and Treg cell lines, we show that suppression of CD154 expression is a surrogate for suppression of proliferation. We propose this as a suitable alternative to the MLR assay, as it is rapid and may be more amenable to high-throughput screening, analysing large cohorts of clinical samples or assaying transiently suppressive populations.

One particular area of interest is targeting mechanisms of immune tolerance. Using a murine model of mesothelioma, we investigated the roles of regulatory T-cells, intratumoural transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and the negative regulator molecule cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) in immune tolerance to tumours. It was found that treatments targeting a single negative regulator molecule mechanism were not as effective against tumours as targeting multiple mechanisms simultaneously. Most importantly, it was found that a combined triple treatment of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-CTLA-4 mAb and TGF-beta soluble receptor resulted in long-term clearance of tumours and memory against tumour rechallenge. These data suggest that clinical application of immunotherapies against tumours may be improved by simultaneously targeting multiple mechanisms of immune suppression.

For instance, lineage-and stage-specific expression of Cd4 and ThPOK is controlled by a transcriptional silencer embedded in each locus, whose activity requires bindings of Runx complexes. The evolutionarily conserved VWRPY pentapeptide sequences in Runx proteins have been shown to be responsible for repressive function as a platform to recruit Groucho/TLE transcriptional corepressors. However, it remains elusive whether requirement for the VWRPY motif differs among Runx target genes. By examining mice lacking VWRPY motifs in both Runx1 and Runx3 proteins, here, we show a full and partial derepression of Cd4 and ThPOK in CD8-linegae T cells, respectively. Thus, whereas Cd4 silencing completely depends on the VWRPY motif, both VWRPY-dependent and -independent mechanisms operate to repress ThPOK gene. These results indicate that Runx proteins utilize different modes to repress expression of different target genes.

However, the role of IL-27 and how it regulates IL-21 from human CD8(+) T cells is unclear. Here, we show that the IL-27 receptor is expressed on human CD8(+) T cells and stimulation of human naive CD8(+) T cells in the presence of IL-27 leads to an increase in IL-21 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production. IL-21 induction in IL-27-stimulated human CD8(+) T cells correlates specifically with expression of the transcription factor T-bet. IL-27 stimulation of naive CD8(+) T cells induces a double-positive T-bet(+) IL-21(+) expressing CD8(+) T-cell population. Furthermore, IL-27 stimulation of human naive CD8(+) T cells greatly increases expression of granzyme B. Antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-21 abrogates IL-27-induced granzyme B expression. Moreover, direct addition of IL-21 greatly amplifies granzyme B expression in human naive CD8(+) T cells. Our findings identify IL-27-induced IL-21 as a key autocrine regulator of granzyme B expression in human CD8(+) T cells.

The major functions of IL-22 in the intestine are the stimulation of epithelial cells to produce a wide variety of antibacterial proteins, the reinforcement of mucus barrier through stimulation of mucin 1 production under intestinal inflammatory conditions, and the enhancement of epithelial regeneration with goblet cell restitution. Through these beneficial functions, IL-22 contributes to the improvement of some types of experimental chronic colitis, which are mediated by T helper (Th)1 or Th2 responses. Most important, studies using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches have clearly demonstrated the ability of IL-22 to promote intestinal wound healing from acute intestinal injury. These findings highlight IL-22 as an attractive and promising target for future IBD therapy. Alternatively, the enormous progress in the field of IL-22 biology has also suggested more complicated mechanisms with the IL-22 pathway than previously predicted. This review article briefly summarizes previous and current knowledge on IL-22 particularly associated with intestinal inflammation. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2012;) ", Gastroenterology & Hepatology
