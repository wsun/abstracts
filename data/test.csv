Depending upon the discipline, complex systems theory has accrued many flavors. We are after a formal representation, a model that can predict the outcome of a complex adaptive system (CAS). In this article, we look at the nature of complexity, then provide a perspective based on discrete event systems (DEVS) theory. We pin down many of the shared features between CAS and artificial systems. We begin with an overview of network science showing how adaptive behavior in these scale-free networks can lead to emergence through stigmergy in CAS. We also address how both self-organization and emergence interplay in a CAS. We then build a case for the view that stigmergic systems are a special case of CAS. We then discuss DEVS levels of systems specifications and present the dynamic structure extensions of DEVS formalism that lends itself to a study of CAS and in turn, stigmergy. Finally, we address the shortcomings and the limitation of current DEVS extensions and propose the required augmentation to model stigmergy and CAS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.3109/15569527.2012.692135,Dendritic cells and the assessment in vitro of skin sensitizing potential,"Abstract: It is now well established that dendritic cells (DC) play pivotal roles in the initiation and orchestration of adaptive immune responses, including cutaneous immune responses to chemical allergens that drive the acquisition of skin sensitization. It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology. ", Ophthalmology; Toxicology 
10.3109/15569527.2012.684419,Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation secondary to external insult: an overview of the quantitative analysis of pigmentation,"Abstract: Context: Despite new technologies, few studies have quantified changes in melanocyte numbers associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to exogenous causes.

Objective: This article aims to review what is known about the pathogenesis of PIH secondary to external insults and its relationship to the resultant degree of quantitative changes in melanocytes.

Methods: We performed a review of articles exploring PIH resulting from external cutaneous insults retrieved through database searching. We reviewed relevant articles for the pathogenesis, histopathology, and quantitative changes in melanocytes related to specific etiologies of PIH. Methodologies to quantify pigmentation changes in dermatologic conditions with clinical hyperpigmentation were also explored.

Results: Significant increases in melanocyte counts of irritant affected skin is seen compared with melanocyte counts of unaffected skin. An increase in melanocyte counts was also found for spontaneous inflammatory dermatoses, even in the absence of clinical hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, changes in melanocyte density and appearance are also seen secondary to inflammation. In addition, increases in epidermal melanocytes are seen with cutaneous exposure to certain agents, and melanocyte increases vary by exposure agent.

Conclusions: The degree of hyperpigmentation related to the intensity and duration of exposure to the causative factors of PIH is essential to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease process. The application of new methodologies to determine quantitative changes in melanocytes elicited by specific causative inflammatory agents has implications to prevent PIH, add to knowledge about disease duration, to develop better treatments for PIH, and to aid our understanding of the biology of the melanocyte.

10.1002/jcp.24156,Regulation of lung fibroblast activation by annexin A1,"Abstract: Annexin-A1 (AnxA1) is a glucocorticoid-induced protein with multiple actions in the regulation of inflammatory cell activation. The contribution of AnxA1 to human cell biology is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of AnxA1 and its receptor, formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), to the regulation of inflammatory responses in human normal lung fibroblasts (NLF). Silencing constitutive AnxA1 expression in NLF using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with moderate but significant increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced proliferation and interleukin (IL)-6 production, accompanied by reduction of ERK and NF-kappa B activity. AnxA1 regulation of ERK and NF-kappa B activation was associated with effects on proliferation. Blocking FPR2 using the specific antagonist WRW4 mimicked the effects of AnxA1 silencing on TNF-induced proliferation, IL-6, ERK, and NF-kappa B activation. AnxA1 silencing also impaired inhibitory effects of glucocorticoid on IL-6 production and on the expression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), but blocking FPR2 failed to mimic these effects of AnxA1 silencing. These data suggest that AnxA1 regulates TNF-induced proliferation and inflammatory responses in lung fibroblasts, via effects on the ERK and NF-kappa B pathways, which depend on FPR2. AnxA1 also mediates effects of glucocorticoids and GILZ expression, but these effects appear independent of FPR2. These findings suggest that mimicking AnxA1 actions might have therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory lung diseases. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 476484, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
