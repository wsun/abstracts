This knowledge base of the inner ear's structure/function has been an essential factor for the design and construction of prosthetic devices to aid patients with deficits in their senses of hearing and balance. Prosthetic devices are now available for severely hearing impaired and deaf patients to restore hearing and are known as cochlear implants and auditory brain stem implants. A prosthetic device for patients with balance disorders is being perfected and is in an animal model testing phase with another prosthetic device for controlling intractable dizziness in Meniere's patients currently being evaluated in clinical testing. None of this would have been possible without the pioneering studies and discoveries of the investigators mentioned in this review and with the work of many other talented investigators to numerous to be covered in this review.

Sialylated glycans are of special interest because the terminal position of sialic acid (NeuAc) in glycans linked by different ways to subterminal monosaccharides has been shown to be involved in several biological processes, as occurs with gangliosides, which have been reported as being essential in spermatogenesis in mammals. Some glycan-binding proteins, the lectins, which specifically recognize glycan sequences, have been extensively used to characterize tissue and cell carbohydrates by means of cytochemical techniques. The aim of the present work was to determine the presence of NeuAc by means of histochemical techniques in the testis of Xenopus laevis, an animal model widely used in cell and molecular biology research. However, considering that some NeuAc-binding lectins are capable of binding to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), other GlcNAc-binding lectins were also assayed. The results showed that NeuAc is mainly expressed in the interstitium, and only a weak labelling in the male germ cells was observed. Most NeuAc was located in O-linked oligosaccharides, but some masked NeuAc in N-glycans were identified in primary and secondary spermatogonia and spermatocytes. By contrast, GlcNAc was widely expressed in all germ cell types. Deglycosylative pre-treatments suggest that both N- and O-glycans and/or glycolipids could be responsible for this labelling. In addition, GlcNAc in O-linked oligosaccharides has been identified in spermatogonial cells. The acrosome of spermatids was always negative. Variations of glycan expression have been found in different cell types, suggesting that glycosylation is modified during spermatogenetic development.

The aim of this study is to describe the reproductive biology of Caryophyllia inornata, a temperate species, and to increase the understanding of the reproductive strategies of Mediterranean corals. Samples of C. inornata were collected during SCUBA surveys at Elba island. Sexually active individuals displayed either male or female germ cells, showing a gonochoric sexuality. C. inornata exhibited an unusual pattern of embryogenesis. Embryos appeared throughout the whole year in males and in sexually inactive individuals, and they did not show a seasonal pattern of development, as usually expected for sexual reproduction. This observation suggests the possibility of asexual origin. These embryogenetic sexually inactive individuals were larger in size than the embryogenetic sexually active ones, and they might be senile polyps that preserve the ability to produce embryos only by agamic reproduction.

The pine seed chamber formed by the larva is also described and commented on. The simple larval chaetotaxy includes more of the minute posture sensing setae, proprioceptors, than expected from the lepidopteran larval ground plan. The excess of proprioceptors is suggested to be necessary for sensory input concerning the larval posture within the seed chamber. The trunk musculature includes an autapomorphic radial ventral musculature made up of unique multisegmental muscles. The combined presence of additional proprioceptors and the unique ventral musculature is proposed to be related to the larval movement within the confined space of the seed chamber, especially to a proposed somersault movement that allows the larva to orientate itself within the chamber.

Based on mitosis and meiosis, there are five periods: Mitosis of Oogonia, Active Meiosis I, Arrested Meiosis I, Active Meiosis II, and Arrested Meiosis II. The Periods are divided into six stages: Mitotic Division of Oogonia, Chromatin Nucleolus, Primary Growth, Secondary Growth, Oocyte Maturation and Ovulation. The Chromatin Nucleolus Stage is divided into four steps: Leptotene, Zygotene, Pachytene, and Early Diplotene. Oocytes in the last step possess one nucleolus, dispersed chromatin with forming lampbrush chromosomes and lack basophilic ooplasm. The Primary Growth Stage, characterized by basophilic ooplasm and absence of yolk in oocytes, is divided into five steps: One-Nucleolus, Multiple Nucleoli, Perinucleolar, Oil Droplets, and Cortical Alveolar. During primary growth, the Balbiani body develops from nuage, enlarges and disperses throughout the ooplasm as both endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi develop within it. Secondary growth or vitellogenesis has three steps: Early Secondary Growth, Late Secondary Growth and Full-Grown. The Oocyte Maturation Stage, including ooplasmic and germinal vesicle maturation, has four steps: Eccentric Germinal Vesicle, Germinal Vesicle Migration, Germinal Vesicle Breakdown and Resumption of Meiosis when complete yolk hydration occurs. The period is Arrested Meiosis II. When folliculogenesis is completed, the ovarian follicle, an oocyte and encompassing follicle cells, is surrounded by a basement membrane and developing theca, all forming a follicle complex. After ovulation, a newly defined postovulatory follicle complex remains attached to the germinal epithelium. It is composed of a basement membrane that separates the postovulatory follicle from the postovulatory theca. Arrested Meiosis I encompasses primary and secondary growth (vitellogenesis) and includes most of oocyte maturation until the resumption of meiosis (Active Meiosis II). The last stage, Ovulation, is the emergence of the oocyte from the follicle when it becomes an egg or ovum. J. Morphol. 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An important facial aspect is the display of bilateral symmetry, invoking the need to investigate aspects of symmetry and asymmetry separately when examining facial shape. Previous studies typically employed landmarks that provided only a sparse facial representation, where different landmark choices could lead to contrasting outcomes. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism is only tested as a difference of sample means, which is statistically the same as a difference in population location only. Within the framework of geometric morphometrics, we partition facial shape, represented in a spatially dense way, into patterns of symmetry and asymmetry, following a two-factor anova design. Subsequently, we investigate sexual dimorphism in symmetry and asymmetry patterns separately, and on multiple aspects, by examining (i) population location differences as well as differences in population variance-covariance; (ii) scale; and (iii) orientation. One important challenge in this approach is the proportionally high number of variables to observations necessitating the implementation of permutational and computationally feasible statistics. In a sample of gender-matched young adults (1825 years) with self-reported European ancestry, we found greater variation in male faces than in women for all measurements. Statistically significant sexual dimorphism was found for the aspect of location in both symmetry and asymmetry (directional asymmetry), for the aspect of scale only in asymmetry (magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry) and, in contrast, for the aspect of orientation only in symmetry. Interesting interplays with hypotheses in evolutionary and developmental biology were observed, such as the selective nature of the force underpinning sexual dimorphism and the genetic independence of the structural patterns of fluctuating asymmetry. Additionally, insights into growth patterns of the soft tissue envelope of the face and underlying skull structure can also be obtained from the results.

In this study, the conditioned media derived from chondrocyte/scaffold constructs were used to direct chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The porcine articular chondrocytes were seeded on the PGA/PLA scaffolds to form chondrocyte/scaffold constructs and were cultured to form engineered cartilage in vitro. The culture media were collected as conditioned media and used for chondrogenic induction of BMSC pellets (experimental group, Exp.). The chondrocyte pellets and BMSC pellets were cultured routinely as positive control (PC) and negative control (NC), respectively. After 4 weeks, the wet weight and GAG content in Exp. group and PC group were significantly higher than that in NC group. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis showed that cartilaginous tissue was formed with typical cartilage lacuna structure and positive staining of collagen Type II (Col II) in the peripheral area of the BMSC pellets in Exp. group. Gene expression of Sox9, Col II, and COMP in Exp. group and PC group were significantly higher than that in NC group. The growth factors in the conditioned media derived from human costal chondrocytes-scaffold constructs were tested by protein microassay. The conditioned media contained low levels of TGF-beta 1,2,3, IGF-1 and high levels of IGF-2, FGF-4, and IGFBP4,6, and so forth. The soluble factors derived from the engineered cartilage can induce chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs independently. Many cytokines may function in chondrogenesis in a coordinated way.

Here, we describe a captured specimen (26 cm living length) as the holotype of Allapasus aurantiacus n. gen., n. sp. The small proboscis is dome-shaped, and the collar is only slightly wider than deep; both of these body regions are more muscular than in other torquaratorids, which presumably facilitates burrowing. The proboscis complex, in contrast to that of shallow-living enteropneusts, lacks a pericardial sac and is located relatively posteriorly in the proboscis stalk. The stomochord is separated from the main course of the gut by the intervention of a small, plate-like proboscis skeleton lacking posterior horns. The most anterior region of the trunk houses the pharynx, in which the pharyngeal skeletal bars are not connected by synapticles. The postpharyngeal trunk comprises three intestinal regions: prehepatic, hepatic (with conspicuous sacculations), and posthepatic. On either side of the worm, a flap of body wall (lateral wing) runs the entire length of the trunk. The two lateral wings can wrap the body so their edges meet in the dorsal midline, although they often gape open along the pharyngeal region. The holotype is a female (presumably the species is gonochoric) with numerous ovaries located in the lateral wings along the pharyngeal region. Each larger ovary contains a single primary oocyte (up to 1,500 mu m in diameter) and bulges outwards in an epidermal pouch attached to the rest of the body by a slender stalk. Such externalized ovaries are unprecedented in any animal, and nothing is yet known of their role in the reproductive biology of A. aurantiacus. J. Morphol. 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Until now, histological studies of the nonmammaliaform cynodonts have focused only on postcranial material. Through the examination of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scans and serial thin sections, the current study provides a novel perspective on the structure and growth of the mandible of Tritylodon, a derived herbivorous cynodont from southern Africa. By tracking histological features across the serial thin sections, trends in relocation and modelling are documented for the growing Tritylodon mandible. For example, during growth, localized changes in the cross-sectional shape of the mandible occurred. Localized deposits of new lamellar and fibrolamellar bone on the lateral edge indicate widening of the mandible during different episodes of growth. The presence of radial channels indicates the deepening of the mandible at its anterior and posterior ends. The relocation of the paired mental foramina suggests that the mandibular body lengthened mainly in the posterior direction. The medial movement of a posterior postcanine tooth during growth and eruption is recorded in the histology. This histological assessment also documents the presence of Sharpeys fibres in the cellular cementum of the first incisor, providing novel and unequivocal evidence that it was attached to the Tritylodon jaw by a periodontal ligament. This is the first comprehensive study that uses histological analysis to document the growth dynamics of the mandible of a nonmammalian therapsid, thus providing a unique perspective of localized mandibular growth in a fossil animal.

The Mecoptera are unique in Holometabola for their larvae possessing a pair of compound eyes instead of stemmata. The ultrastructure of the larval eyes of the scorpionfly Panorpa dubia Chou and Wang, 1981 was investigated using transmission electron microscopy. Each ommatidium possesses a cornea, a tetrapartite eucone crystalline cone, eight retinula cells, two primary pigment cells, and an undetermined number of secondary pigment cells. The rhabdomeres of the eight retinula cells form a centrally-fused, tiered rhabdom of four distal and four proximal retinula cells. The rhabdomeres of the four distal retinula cells extend distally into a funnel shape around the basal surface of the crystalline cone. Based on the similarity of the larval eyes of Panorpidae to the eyes of the hemimetabolous insects and the difference from the stemmata of the holometabolous larvae, the evolutionary origin of the holometabolous larvae is briefly discussed.

This phenomenon is generally thought to result from sexual selection, but it is predicted that limited storage space in the body cavity and the difficulty of using the elongated organs should have constrained the evolution of extreme elongation, neutralizing any selective advantage. Therefore, in groups with long intromittent organs, features that overcome these constraints may have evolved or coevolved together with intromittent organ elongation. Using a comparative morphological approach and outgroup comparisons, we identified potential constraints and key novelties that may neutralize such constraints in the leaf beetle subfamily Criocerinae. Observations of the internal sac structure throughout Criocerinae were performed. Comparing the results with preceding studies from outgroups, a ground plan of the criocerine internal sac was constructed. Our analysis also identified specific features that are always correlated with extreme elongation: the rotation of whole internal-sac sclerites and the possession of a pocket in which to store the elongated flagellum. The pocket is thought to be formed by the rotation of the sclerites, markedly altering internal sac shape from the criocerine ground plan. Onlythe clades that have acquired this derived state contain species with an elongated flagellum that distinctly exceeds the median lobe length. It is presumed that these character correlations evolved independently three times. The detected character correlations corroborate the hypothesis that there are latent adaptive constraints for the evolution of extremely elongated intromittent organs. The constraints may have been neutralized by the alteration from the criocerine ground plan resulting in the formation of a storage pocket. In conclusion, deviation from the criocerine ground plan isconsidered to be the evolutionary innovation that neutralized the latent adaptive constraints of flagellum elongation in the subfamily Criocerinae.

Precocial bird species grow slowly, but have high mammillary density, while altricial bird species grow rapidly, but have low mammillary density. These results suggest an adaptation associated with growth rate and mode of development and show, moreover, that the mammillary layer is indicative of the breeding biology of the bird. J.

Gradually a more dynamic and historical understanding of human populations came to substitute for older classificatory and typological approaches in the colonial laboratory, leading to the creation of the field of human biology and challenges to scientific racism. Elite U.S. institutions and philanthropic foundations competed for the authority to define Pacific bodies and mentalities during this period.

The race statements played a key role in the establishment of the postwar liberal antiracist orthodoxy, and their history illuminates broader dynamics in the production of scientific scripts intended to influence political debates. The consensus was rooted in the synthesis of physical anthropology and population biology but depended on a parallel strengthening of antiracist social norms in the international community. As much as race, conflicts over the race statements were disputes over scientific authority-over who, if anyone, should be authorized to speak for science. Because international civil servants and activist scientists had to negotiate disciplinary, national, and international politics to achieve an acceptable consensus, a close reading of this history reveals the importance of shifting political and social meanings of equality on scientific statements of biological facts. Two central ironies that emerge are the shifting association of bell curves from representations of liberal racial tolerance to icons of enduring racism and the importance of increasing racial and national diversity in the international scientific community to discrediting biological determinism.

All of these codes emphasize the centrality of voluntary consent and set forth criteria that must be met before any research can be conducted.

One topic of intense interest is the search of specific behavioural mechanisms at stake at the individual level and from which the school properties emerges. This is fundamental for understanding how selective pressure acting at the individual level promotes adaptive properties of schools and in trying to disambiguate functional properties from non-adaptive epiphenomena. Decades of studies on collective motion by means of individual-based modelling have allowed a qualitative understanding of the self-organization processes leading to collective properties at school level, and provided an insight into the behavioural mechanisms that result in coordinated motion. Here, we emphasize a set of paradigmatic modelling assumptions whose validity remains unclear, both from a behavioural point of view and in terms of quantitative agreement between model outcome and empirical data. We advocate for a specific and biologically oriented re-examination of these assumptions through experimental-based behavioural analysis and modelling.

Motility of the rod-shaped cells of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus depends on two motility machineries, type IV pili (giving rise to S-motility) and the gliding motility apparatus (giving rise to A-motility). Cell motility is regulated by occasional reversals. Moving M. xanthus cells can organize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies, depending on their nutritional status. To ultimately understand these two pattern-formation processes and the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as the cell reversal machinery, we analyse spatial self-organization in three M. xanthus strains: (i) a mutant that moves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, (ii) a unidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and (iii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, occasionally reverses its direction of movement. The mutant moving by means of the A-engine illustrates that collective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding bacteria owing to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need of invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant reveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are present, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the study of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces the formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while it results in vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are consistent with what is known from self-propelled rod models, which strongly suggests that the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions is the pattern-formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. On the other hand, we learn that when cells occasionally reverse their moving direction, as observed in the wild-type, cells form small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like structure at high enough densities. These results have been obtained from a careful analysis of the cluster statistics of ensembles of cells, and analysed in the light of a coagulation Smoluchowski equation with fragmentation.

It has also been proposed that cell fusion causes cancer and contributes to its progression. These functions rely on a poorly understood ability of cell fusion to create new cell types. We suggest that this ability can be understood by considering cells as attractor networks whose basic property is to adopt a set of distinct, stable, self-maintaining states called attractors. According to this view, fusion of two cell types is a collision of two networks that have adopted distinct attractors. To learn how these networks reach a consensus, we model cell fusion computationally. To do so, we simulate patterns of gene activities using a formalism developed to simulate patterns of memory in neural networks. We find that the hybrid networks can assume attractors that are unrelated to parental attractors, implying that cell fusion can create new cell types by nearly instantaneously moving cells between attractors. We also show that hybrid networks are prone to assume spurious attractors, which are emergent and sporadic network states. This finding means that cell fusion can produce abnormal cell types, including cancerous types, by placing cells into normally inaccessible spurious states. Finally, we suggest that the problem of colliding networks has general significance in many processes represented by attractor networks, including biological, social, and political phenomena.

One limitation is that one model simulation tests a parameter set representing one instance of the biological counterpart, whereas biological systems are heterogeneous in their properties and behavior, and a model often is fitted to represent an ideal average. This is also true for models of a cell's electrical activity; even within a narrowly defined population there can be considerable variation in electrophysiological phenotype. Here, we describe a computational experimental approach for parameterizing a model of the electrical activity of a cell in real time. We combine the inexpensive parallel computational power of a programmable graphics processing unit with the flexibility of the dynamic clamp method. The approach involves 1), recording a cell's electrical activity, 2), parameterizing a model to the recording, 3), generating predictions, and 4), testing the predictions on the same cell used for the calibration. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our approach using a cell line (GH4C1). These cells are electrically active, and they display tonic spiking or bursting. We use our approach to predict parameter changes that can convert one pattern to the other.

To understand DNA organization and dynamics, it is important to consider the physical and topological constraints acting on it. In the eukaryotic cell nucleus, DNA is organized by proteins acting as spools on which DNA can be wrapped. These proteins can subsequently interact and form a structure called the chromatin fibre. Using a simple geometric model, we propose a general method for computing topological properties (twist, writhe and linking number) of the DNA embedded in those fibres. The relevance of the method is reviewed through the analysis of magnetic tweezers single molecule experiments that revealed unexpected properties of the chromatin fibre. Possible biological implications of these results are discussed.

Data collection and analysis are also broadly similar for both radiation types. There are fundamental differences, however, between the interaction of X-rays and neutrons with matter, which makes them strongly complementary for structural studies in biology. The property of neutrons to distinguish natural abundance hydrogen from its deuterium isotope and the dispersion relation that leads to the energy of similar to 1 neutrons being of the order of thermal energy are well known. They form the basis, respectively, of contrast variation on the one hand and energy-resolved scattering experiments to study macromolecular dynamics-neutron-specific scattering methods on the other. Interestingly, analysis procedures for the structural and dynamics experiments display common aspects that can be expressed as straight-line relationships. These not only act as controls of good sample preparation, but also yield model-free parameters on an absolute scale that provide fundamental information on the structure and dynamics of the system under study.

Miniaturization of chemical and biological assays, performed by use of micro/nanofluidics, requires both careful selection of the methods of fabrication and the development of materials designed for specific applications. This, in turn, increases the need for interdisciplinary combination of suitable microfabrication and characterisation techniques. In this review, the advantages of combining X-ray lithography, as fabrication technique, with small-angle X-ray scattering measurements will be discussed. X-ray lithography enables the limitations of small-angle X-ray scattering, specifically time resolution and sample environment, to be overcome. Small-angle X-ray scattering, on the other hand, enables investigation and, consequently, adjustment of the nanostructural morphology of microstructures and materials fabricated by X-ray lithography. Moreover, the effect of X-ray irradiation on novel materials can be determined by use of small-angle X-ray scattering. The combination of top-down and bottom-up methods to develop new functional materials and structures with potential in biology will be reported.

A major application of these pathways is generating a large amount of the desired product. However, toxicity due to the possible presence of toxic precursors is one of the main problems for such production. We consider here the problem of generating a large amount of product from a potentially toxic substrate. To address this, we propose a simple biosynthetic pathway, which can be induced in order to produce a large number of the product molecules, by keeping the substrate amount at low levels. Surprisingly, we show that the large product generation crucially depends on fast non-specific degradation of the substrate molecules. We derive an optimal induction strategy, which allows as much as three orders of magnitude increase in the product amount through biologically realistic parameter values. We point to a recently discovered bacterial immune system (CRISPR/Cas in E. coli) as a putative example of the pathway analysed here. We also argue that the scheme proposed here can be used not only as a stand-alone pathway, but also as a strategy to produce a large amount of the desired molecules with small perturbations of endogenous biosynthetic pathways.

On the other hand, a wealth of molecular level qualitative data on individual components and interactions can be obtained from the experimental literature and high-throughput technologies, making qualitative approaches such as Boolean network modeling extremely useful. In this paper, we build on our research to provide a methodology overview of Boolean modeling in systems biology, including Boolean dynamic modeling of cellular networks, attractor analysis of Boolean dynamic models, as well as inferring biological regulatory mechanisms from high-throughput data using Boolean models. We finally demonstrate how Boolean models can be applied to perform the structural analysis of cellular networks.

The tendency for these surfaces to expel water from their vicinity leads to self-assembly of macromolecular complexes. In this article, we show with a realistic model for a biologically pertinent system how this phenomenon appears at the molecular level. We focus on the association of the C-terminal domain (CA-C) of the human immunodeficiency virus capsid protein. By combining all-atom simulations with specialized sampling techniques, we measure the water density distribution during the approach of two CA-C proteins as a function of separation and amino acid sequence in the interfacial region. The simulations demonstrate that CA-C protein-protein interactions sit at the edge of a dewetting transition and that this mesoscopic manifestation of the underlying liquid-vapor phase transition can be readily manipulated by biology or protein engineering to significantly affect association behavior. Although the wild-type protein remains wet until contact, we identify a set of in silico mutations, in which three hydrophilic amino acids are replaced with nonpolar residues, that leads to dewetting before association. The existence of dewetting depends on the size and relative locations of substituted residues separated by nanometer length scales, indicating long-range cooperativity and a sensitivity to surface topography. These observations identify important details that are missing from descriptions of protein association based on buried hydrophobic surface area.

While it was previously believed that the small bacterial cell size and fast diffusion in the cytoplasm effectively remove any such gradient, a new computational study published in BMC Biophysics supports the emerging view that gradients can exist. The study arose from the recent observation that phosphorylated CtrA forms a gradient prior to cell division in Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium known for its complicated cell cycle. Tropini et al. (2012) postulate that such gradients can provide an internal chemical compass, directing protein localization, cell division and cell development. More specifically, they describe biochemical and physical constraints on the formation of such gradients and explore a number of existing bacterial cell morphologies. These chemical gradients may limit in vitro analyses, and may ensure timing control and robustness to fluctuations during critical stages in cell development.

We investigate the voltage and lateral pressure dependence of their capacitance close to their chain melting transition. Because the gel and the fluid membrane have different area and thickness, the capacitance of the two membrane phases is different. In the presence of external fields, charges exert forces that can influence the state of the membrane, thereby influencing the transition temperature. This phenomenon is called ""electrostriction"". We show that this effect allows us to introduce a capacitive susceptibility that assumes a maximum in the melting transition with an associated excess charge. As a consequence, voltage regimes exist in which a small change in voltage can lead to a large uptake of charge and a large capacitive current. Furthermore, we consider electromechanical behavior such as pressure-induced changes in capacitance, and the application of such concepts in biology.

This phenomenon is named such things as dynamic disorder, heterogeneity, hysteretic or mnemonic enzymes across these different fields, and has been directly demonstrated by single molecule enzymology and NMR studies recently. We analyzed enzyme slow conformational changes in the context of regulatory networks. A single enzymatic reaction with slow conformational changes can filter upstream network noises, and can either resonantly respond to the system stimulus at certain frequencies or respond adaptively for sustained input signals of the network fluctuations. It thus can serve as a basic functional motif with properties that are normally for larger intermolecular networks in the field of systems biology. We further analyzed examples including enzymes functioning against pH fluctuations, metabolic state change of Artemia embryos, and kinetic insulation of fluctuations in metabolic networks. The study also suggests that hysteretic enzymes may be building blocks of synthetic networks with various properties such as narrow-banded filtering. The work fills the missing gap between studies on enzyme biophysics and network level dynamics, and reveals that the coupling between the two is functionally important; it also suggests that the conformational dynamics of some enzymes may be evolutionally selected.

Due to its high free energy, however, the transition state generally cannot be trapped and studied directly using traditional structural biology methods. Thus, characterizing the structure of the transition state that occurs as proteins fold and unfold remains a major challenge. Here, we report a novel (to our knowledge) method that uses engineered bi-histidine (bi-His) metal-binding sites to directly map the structure of the mechanical unfolding transition state of proteins. This method is adapted from the traditional psi-value analysis, which uses engineered bi-His metal chelation sites to probe chemical (un)folding transition-state structure. The phi(M2+) (upsilon)-value is defined as Delta Delta G double dagger(-N)/Delta Delta G(U-N), which is the energetic effects of metal chelation by the bi-His site on the unfolding energy barrier (Delta G double dagger(-N)) relative to its thermodynamic stability (Delta G(U-N)) and can be used to obtain information about the transition state in the mutational site. As a proof of principle, we used the small protein GB1 as a model system and set out to map its mechanical unfolding transition-state structure. Using single-molecule atomic force microscopy and spectrofluorimetry, we directly quantified the effect of divalent metal ion binding on the mechanical unfolding free energy and thermodynamic stability of GB1, which allowed us to quantify phi(M2+)(upsilon)-values for different sites in GB1. Our results enabled us to map the structure of the mechanical unfolding transition state of GB1. Within GB1's mechanical unfolding transition state, the interface between force-bearing beta-strands 1 and 4 is largely disrupted, and the first beta-hairpin is partially disordered while the second beta-hairpin and the alpha-helix remain structured. Our results demonstrate the unique application of psi-value analysis in elucidating the structure of the transition state that occurs during the mechanical unfolding process, offering a potentially powerful new method for investigating the design of novel elastomeric proteins.

Chromosomal DNA is associated with histones and different structural models consider that the resulting long chromatin fibers are folded forming loops or more irregular three-dimensional networks. Here, we report that fragments of chromatin fibers obtained from human metaphase chromosomes digested with micrococcal nuclease associate spontaneously forming multilaminar platelike structures. These self-assembled structures are identical to the thin plates found previously in partially denatured chromosomes. Under metaphase ionic conditions, the fragments that are initially folded forming the typical 30-nm chromatin fibers are untwisted and incorporated into growing plates. Large plates can be self-assembled from very short chromatin fragments, indicating that metaphase chromatin has a high tendency to generate plates even when there are many discontinuities in the DNA chain. Self-assembly at 37 degrees C favors the formation of thick plates having many layers. All these results demonstrate conclusively that metaphase chromatin has the intrinsic capacity to self-organize as a multilayered planar structure. A chromosome structure consistent of many stacked layers of planar chromatin avoids random entanglement of DNA, and gives compactness and a high physical consistency to chromatids.

Efforts to reduce the macrovascular and microvascular residual risk have been directed toward a multifactorial CVD risk-factor modification; nonetheless, long-term complications remain high. Dual-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/gamma agonists may offer opportunities to lower macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus beyond the reductions achieved with conventional risk-factor modification. The information presented elucidates the differentiation of compound-specific vs class-effect properties of PPARs as the basis for future development of a new candidate molecule. Prior experience with thiazolidinediones, an approved class of PPAR gamma agonists, and glitazars, investigational class of dual-PPAR alpha/gamma agonists, also provides important lessons about the risks and benefits of targeting a nuclear receptor while revealing some of the future challenges for regulatory approval.

Despite significant progress in the understanding, the mechanisms and pathophysiology of AF treatments are often unsatisfactory. This in part may be related to the complexity of this arrhythmia, as well as its evolution overtime. Atrial fibrillation has many aetiologies and underlying causes. The anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) and interventions aimed at controlling AF should therefore be based on aetiology and associated conditions, rather than electrophysiological mechanisms. The current guideline in the management of AF in most part is based on safety and outcome. This review will discuss the approach to management, based on primary prevention of AF with the aim to target at risk factors, triggers, specific substrates related to aetiology rather than mechanisms. The development of new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies should consider not only evidence based, but also include patient-specific personalized context system biology and pharmacology; otherwise, we will continue to see moderate drug efficacy at best and negative results and outcomes.

Importantly, a novel role for ATP as an extracellular autocrine and/or paracrine signalling molecule has evolved over the past century and extensive work has been conducted to characterize the ATP-sensitive purinergic receptors expressed on almost all cell types in the body. Extracellular ATP elicits potent effects on vascular cells to regulate blood vessel tone but can also be involved in vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis. While the effects of purinergic signalling in the vasculature have been well documented, the mechanism(s) mediating the regulated release of ATP from cells in the blood vessel wall and circulation are now a key target of investigation. The aim of this review is to examine the current proposed mechanisms of ATP release from vascular cells, with a special emphasis on the transporters and channels involved in ATP release from vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, circulating red blood cells, and perivascular sympathetic nerves, including vesicular exocytosis, plasma membrane F-1/F-0-ATP synthase, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin channels.

Vascular endothelial cells normally provide an efficient barrier against thrombosis, lipid uptake, and inflammation. However, endothelium that has regenerated after percutaneous coronary intervention is incompetent in terms of its integrity and function, with poorly formed cell junctions, reduced expression of antithrombotic molecules, and decreased nitric oxide production. Delayed arterial healing, characterized by poor endothelialization, is the primary cause of late (1 month-1 year postimplantation) and very late stent thrombosis following implantation of drug-eluting stents. Impairment of vasorelaxation in nonstented proximal and distal segments of stented coronary arteries is more severe with drug-eluting stents than bare-metal stents, and stent-induced flow disturbances resulting in complex spatiotemporal shear stress can also contribute to increased thrombogenicity and inflammation. The incompetent endothelium leads to late stent thrombosis and the development of in-stent neoatherosclerosis. The process of neoatherosclerosis occurs more rapidly, and more frequently, following deployment of drug-eluting stents than bare-metal stents. Improved understanding of vascular biology is crucial for all cardiologists, and particularly interventional cardiologists, as maintenance of a competently functioning endothelium is critical for long-term vascular health.

However, the role of mitochondria goes beyond their capacity to create molecular fuel, to include the generation of reactive oxygen species, the regulation of calcium, and activation of cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction is part of both normal and premature ageing, but can contribute to inflammation, cell senescence, and apoptosis. Cardiovascular disease, and in particular atherosclerosis, is characterized by DNA damage, inflammation, cell senescence, and apoptosis. Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial damage and dysfunction also occur in atherosclerosis and may contribute to the multiple pathological processes underlying the disease. This review summarizes the normal role of mitochondria, the causes and consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction, and the evidence for mitochondrial damage and dysfunction in vascular disease.

The ubiquitinproteasome system (UPS) is at the core of protein turnover as the main pathway for the degradation of proteins related to cell-cycle regulation, signalling, apoptosis, and differentiation. This review briefly addresses some structural UPS aspects under the perspective of VSMC (patho)biology. The UPS loss-of-function promotes direct cell effects and many indirect effects related to the adaptation to apoptosis/survival signalling, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The UPS regulates redox homeostasis and is redox-regulated. Also, the UPS closely interacts with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis as the effector of un/misfolded protein degradation, and ER stress is strongly involved in atherosclerosis. Inhibition of cell cycle-controlling ubiquitin ligases or the proteasome reduces VSMC proliferation and prevents modulation of their synthetic phenotype. Proteasome inhibition also strongly promotes VSMC apoptosis and reduces neointima. In atherosclerosis models, proteasome inhibitors display vasculoprotective effects and reduce inflammation. However, worsening of atherosclerosis or vascular dysfunction has also been reported. Proteasome inhibitors sensitize VSMC to increased ER stress-mediated cell death and suppress unfolded protein response signalling. Taken together, these observations show that the UPS has powerful effects in the control of VSMC phenotype and survival signalling. However, more profound knowledge of mechanisms is needed in order to render the UPS an operational therapeutic target.

Observational studies have shown that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased CVD risk. It remains unclear whether strategies aimed at increasing HDL-C in addition to background statin therapy will further reduce risk. The AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trial, which compared combined niacin/simvastatin with simvastatin alone, failed to demonstrate an incremental benefit of niacin among patients with atherosclerotic CVD and on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values <70 mg/dl, but this study had some limitations. Previously, small randomized, clinical trials of niacin plus statins showed that modest regression of carotid atherosclerosis is possible in individuals with CVD, CVD risk equivalents, or atherosclerosis. This viewpoint summarizes these imaging trials studying niacin and places them in the context of the failure of AIM-HIGH to support the HDL-C-increasing hypothesis.

The effect of beta radiation on vWF was further showing by measuring the binding of domain-specific antibodies to radiation treated vWF.Results: 20-Gy beta radiation significantly decreased platelet adhesion to extra cellular matrix protein; vWF and collagen Type III and had no effect on the adhesion upon fibrinogen and fibronectin. The beta-radiation affected mostly the AI, A2 and A3 domains of the vWF molecule on the surface, whereas the D'-D3 and B-C1 domains on the surface remain unaffected and suggesting a significant decrease in vWF binding capacity to the GPIb, heparin and collagen ligands.Conclusion: Beta radiation treatment can alter the reactivity of the certain vessel wall extra cellular matrix proteins, in particular vWF and collagen. The vessel wall may become less prone to platelet adhesion, which results in decrease thrombus formation. It might help to reduce the onset of acute coronary occlusion after the intervention.

Information about these interactions can improve our understanding of diseases and provide the basis to revolutionize therapeutic treatments. However, current experimental techniques for large-scale detection of protein-protein interactions are biased against membrane proteins, it is necessary to develop novel tools to deal with this kind of bio-network. To realize this, we construct membrane protein interaction network based on gene regulatory network model. Three model forms, basic form, non-dimensionalization form, and more complex form, are proposed to understand the dynamic and collective control of developmental process and the characters of membrane protein interaction network, including small-world network, scale free distributing and robustness, and its significance for biology. Four simulation examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and flexibility of the GRN model method for the study of membrane protein interaction network. The results show that the proposed approach holds a high potential to become a useful tool in prediction of membrane protein interactions. Moreover, it has biological significance and value for biology and pharmacology. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In early perceptual processing, the superior colliculus (SC) takes a leading role in integrating visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli in order to direct eye movements. The SC forms a representation of multisensory space through a layering of retinotopic maps which are sensitive to different types of stimuli. These eye-centered topographic maps can adapt to crossmodal stimuli so that the SC can automatically shift our gaze, moderated by cortical feedback. In this paper we describe a neural network model of the SC consisting of a hierarchy of nine topographic maps that combine to form a multisensory retinotopic representation of audio-visual space. Our motivation is to evaluate whether a biologically plausible model of the SC can localize audio-visual inputs live from a camera and two microphones. We use spatial contrast and a novel form of temporal contrast for visual sensitivity, and interaural level difference for auditory sensitivity. Results are comparable with the performance observed in cats where coincident stimuli are accurately localized, while presentation of disparate stimuli causes a significant drop in performance. The benefit of crossmodal localization is shown by adding increasing amounts of noise to the visual stimuli to the point where audio-visual localization significantly out performs visual-only localization. This work demonstrates how a novel, biologically motivated model of low level multisensory processing can be applied to practical, real-world input in real-time, while maintaining its comparability with biology.

We compared complete and incomplete hunting stereotypes in members of a natural ant colony and in naive laboratory-reared ants. We represent behavioral sequences as ""texts"", and compress them using a data compressor. Behavioral units (10 in total), singled out from video records and denoted by letters, served as an alphabet. Successful hunting stereotypes appeared to be characterized by smaller complexity than incomplete ones. A few naive ""born hunters"" which enjoy ""at once and entirely"" complete hunting stereotypes are characterized by a lower level of complexity of hunting behavior. We conclude that innate complete stereotypes have less redundancy and are more predictable, and thus less complex. We suggest that this method for evaluating the complexity of behavioral ""texts"" can serve different purposes, from estimating behavioral variability within populations of animals to comparative analysis of neuronal assemblies within the brain. The method can also be applied to distinguishing between initial and transformed behavioral patterns in many fields of biology and medicine, including studying and diagnosis of neurological diseases reflected in the behavior.

Despite the extensive research effort, many scientific challenges posed by e.g. highly imbalanced training sets and correlation among labels remain to be addressed. The aim of this paper is to use a heterogeneous ensemble of multi-label learners to simultaneously tackle both the sample imbalance and label correlation problems. This is different from the existing work in the sense that we are proposing to combine state-of-the-art multi-label methods by ensemble techniques instead of focusing on ensemble techniques within a multi-label learner. The proposed ensemble approach (EML) is applied to six publicly available multi-label data sets from various domains including computer vision, biology and text using several evaluation criteria.

Quasi-triangulation has been used for efficiently solving various structure/shape related problems for biomolecules. The computation of the quasi-triangulation directly from an input file can take a significant amount of time. If the quasi-triangulation is computed a priori and stored in a file, an application software can directly load the file for solving application problems. In this paper, we propose a neutral file format, called the quasi-triangulation file format QTF, so that users can use the quasi-triangulation more effectively and efficiently by focusing more on his or her own application problems than the Voronoi diagram or the quasi-triangulation itself. The proposed QTF file format was thoroughly validated through an extensive experiment by computing the molecular volumes of one hundred molecular models in the Protein Data Bank. This approach has an important consequence: The QTF file format separates the computation of the Voronoi diagram from its applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Metabolic networks are the representation of these processes describing the complex interactions of biochemical compounds. The Large amount of manifold data concerning metabolic networks continually arising from current research activities in biotechnology leads to the great challenge of information visualization. Visualizing information in networks first of all requires appropriate network diagrams. In the context of metabolic networks, historical conventions regarding the network layout have been established. These layouts are not realizable by prevailing algorithms for automatic graph drawing. Hence, manual graph drawing is the predominating way to set up metabolic network diagrams. This is very time-consuming without software support, especially considering large networks with more than 500 nodes. We present a semi-automatic approach to drawing networks which relies on manual editing supported by two concepts of the interactive and automatic arrangement of nodes and edges. The first concept, called the layout pattern, uses an arbitrarily shaped skeleton as a backbone for the arrangement of nodes and edges. The second concept allows us to wrap a set of repeating drawing steps onto a so-called motif stamp, which can be appended to other parts of a diagram during the drawing process. Finally, a case study demonstrates that both semi-automatic drawing techniques diminish the time to be devoted for the manual network drawing process.

Biochemical networks as representations of processes are very important for a comprehensive understanding of living beings. Drawings of these networks are often visually overloaded and do not scale. A common solution to deal with this complexity is to divide the complete network, for example, the metabolism, into a large set of single pathways that are hierarchically structured. If those pathways are visualized, this strategy generates additional navigation and exploration problems as the user loses the context within the complete network.In this article, we present a general solution to this problem of visualizing interconnected pathways and discuss it in context of biochemical networks. Our new visualization approach supports the analyst in obtaining an overview to related pathways if they are working within a particular pathway of interest. By using glyphs, brushing, and topological information of the related pathways, our interactive visualization is able to intuitively guide the exploration and navigation process, and thus the analysis processes too.

Transmission of shear forces to platelet receptors such as GPIb alpha, P-selectin, alpha(2)beta(1), and alpha(2b)beta(3) controls adhesion dynamics. These forces also drive membrane tether formation, cellular deformation, and mechanosignaling in blood cells. Blood flow results in red blood cell (RBC) drift towards the center of the vessel along with a near-wall plasma layer enriched with platelets. RBC motions also dramatically enhance platelet dispersion. Trajectories of individual platelets near a thrombotic deposit dictate capture-activation-arrest dynamics as these newly arriving platelets are exposed to chemical gradients of ADP, thromboxane, and thrombin within a micron-scale boundary layer formed around the deposit. If shear forces are sufficiently elevated (> 50 dyne/cm(2)), the largest polymers of von Willebrand Factor may elongate with concomitant shear-induced platelet activation. Finally, thrombin generation enhances platelet recruitment and clot strength via fibrin polymerization. By combination of coarse-graining, continuum, and stochastic algorithms, the numerical simulation of the growth rate, composition, and occlusive/embolic potential of a thrombus now spans multiscale phenomena.

Sepsis is a manifestation of disordered systemic inflammation. Properly regulated inflammation allows for timely recognition and effective reaction to injury or infection, but inadequate or overly robust inflammation can lead to Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). There is an incongruity between the systemic nature of disordered inflammation (as the target of inflammation-modulating therapies), and the regional manifestation of organ-specific failure (as the subject of organ support), that presents a therapeutic dilemma: systemic interventions can interfere with an individual organ system's appropriate response, yet organ-specific interventions may not help the overall system reorient itself. Based on a decade of systems and computational approaches to deciphering acute inflammation, along with translationally-motivated experimental studies in both small and large animals, we propose that MODS evolves due to the feed-forward cycle of inflammation -> damage -> inflammation. We hypothesize that inflammation proceeds at a given, ""nested"" level or scale until positive feedback exceeds a ""tipping point."" Below this tipping point, inflammation is contained and manageable; when this threshold is crossed, inflammation becomes disordered, and dysfunction propagates to a higher biological scale (e.g., progressing from cellular, to tissue/organ, to multiple organs, to the organism). Finally, we suggest that a combination of computational biology approaches involving data-driven and mechanistic mathematical modeling, in close association with studies in clinically relevant paradigms of sepsis/MODS, are necessary in order to define scale-specific ""tipping points"" and to suggest novel therapies for sepsis.

Many of these primary data on the tumor vasculature are in the form of images from pre-clinical tumor models that provide a wealth of qualitative and quantitative information in many dimensions and across different spatial scales. However, until recently, the visualization of changes in the tumor vasculature across spatial scales remained a challenge due to a lack of techniques for integrating micro- and macroscopic imaging data. Furthermore, the paucity of three-dimensional (3-D) tumor vascular data in conjunction with the challenges in obtaining such data from patients presents a serious hurdle for the development and validation of predictive, multiscale computational models of tumor angiogenesis.

Forces resulting from physiological exercise at the organ scale are sensed at the cellular scale by osteocytes, which reside inside the bone matrix. Via biochemical pathways, osteocytes orchestrate the local remodeling action of osteoblasts (bone formation) and osteoclasts (bone resorption). Together these local adaptive remodeling activities sum up to strengthen bone globally at the organ scale.

The unlimited transcription (UT) model, in which transcription occurs permissively with a simple activation probability, has been proposed to investigate long-term effects of CNAs on gene expression values. Queueing theory was applied, and the copy-number-gene-expression relationship has been shown to be generally nonlinear in the UT model. However, the dynamic effects of CNAs on transcription and the underlying disorders related to diseases remain greatly unknown. Since most genes in a single cell are permissively transcribed in short periods of time interspersed by long periods of limited transcription, an alternative model for transcription in the restrictive state is needed for unraveling the effects of CNAs on gene expression levels with time. To address these issues, herein a single transcription (ST) model is proposed, in which bound TFs are assumed to be unloaded immediately after stimulating a transcription. Using the Laplace-Stieltjes transform and numerical analysis, the relationship between DNA copy number and gene expression level is evaluated. Dynamic modeling reveals that CNAs would potentially alter, or even reverse, the burst-like gene expression modifications while shifting from the ST model to the UT model. Moreover, functional disorders in transcriptional oscillation due to CNAs are shown via simulation.

However, NSCs/NPs are very sensitive to phototoxic damage, and therefore, fluorescent dyes cannot be used to follow these cells. Also, since in most of NSC/NP-related experiments, a large number of cells neesd to be monitored. Consequently, the acquisition of a huge amount of images is required.

In parallel, there has also been growing interest in developing Systems Biology based methods to study the glycome. The combined goals of these endeavors is to identify glycosylation-dependent mechanisms regulating human physiology, check points that can control the progression of pathophysiology, and modifications to reaction pathways that can result in more uniform biopharmaceutical processes. In these efforts, mathematical models of N- and O-linked glycosylation have emerged as paradigms for the field. While these are relatively few in number, nevertheless, the existing models provide a basic framework that can be used to develop more sophisticated analysis strategies for glycosylation in the future. The current review surveys these computational models with focus on the underlying mathematics and assumptions, and with respect to their ability to generate experimentally testable hypotheses.

The biofilm structural morphology, believed to be an important factor affecting the behavioral properties of these ""super bugs"", is strongly influenced by the local hydrodynamics over the microcolonies. Despite the common use of agitated well plates in the biology community, they have been used rather blindly without knowing the flow characteristics and influence of the rotational speed and fluid volume in these containers. The main purpose of this study is to characterize the flow in these high-throughput devices to link local hydrodynamics to observed behavior in cell cultures. In this work, the flow and wall shear stress distribution in six-well culture plates under planar orbital translation is simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Free surface, flow pattern and wall shear stress for two shaker speeds (100 and 200 rpm) and two volumes of fluid (2 and 4 mL) were investigated. Measurements with a non-intrusive optical shear stress sensor and High Frame-rate Particle Imaging Velocimetry (HFPIV) are used to validate CFD predictions. An analytical model to predict the free surface shape is proposed. Results show a complex three-dimensional flow pattern, varying in both time and space. The distribution of wall shear stress in these culture plates has been related to the topology of flow. This understanding helps explain observed endothelial cell orientation and bacterial biofilm distributions observed in culture dishes. The results suggest that the mean surface stress field is insufficient to capture the underlying dynamics mitigating biological processes.

The groups were daughter cells with no bud scars, and mother cells separated further by number of scars (one, two and more than two). Cells with more than three scars were very rare.Compression testing by micromanipulation was used to determine key mechanical properties of the sorted cells. For all cells the force and fractional deformation at bursting could be determined. For 69% of cells overall but only 32% of daughter cells, a large strain mathematical model using a linear elastic constitutive equation for the wall material could be fitted to force deformation data up to cell wall failure. For these cells, the wall surface modulus, elastic modulus, initial stretch ratio and strain energy per unit volume at bursting could be estimated. For the remainder of the cells, the lack of permanent deformation on repeated compression and release (at deformations not causing bursting) suggested the cell wall material was non-linear elastic but with no observable plastic behaviour.This is the first report to show directly that bud scars affect the global mechanical properties of yeast cells and that the important distinction with respect to scars is between daughter and mother cells. The former were smaller with more elastic walls and a higher mean initial stretch ratio. For cells for which the model could be fitted, the mean circumferential strain at bursting decreased with scarring (consistent with stiffer walls) whilst the stress increased. This may be due to the reported absence of chitin in the walls of daughter cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The interdigitating microelectrodes of our portable system were produced by microfabrication technology with a width of 8 mu m. a gap of 8 mu m, and a length of 500 mu m. These microelectrodes provided a high electric field for AC impedance measurements. When mouse L929 cells were cultured on the electrode surface and pre-coated with poly-L-lysine, the changes in the impedance on the interdigitating electrodes represented the lag, log, and stationary phases of a typical cell growth curve. The impedance measurement result was fitted to an equivalent circuit, which showed that the capacitance signal was the major contributor to the total impedance of the cell culture. The capacitance arises from the cell capacitance, the double-layer capacitance and the capacitance of the poly-L-lysine-coated surface, and the changes in capacitance were probably due to cell proliferation and the resulting changes in cell metabolites. To make the device portable and provide rapid results, we designed a novel impedance detection system comprised of a microprocessor, an AD5933 impedance converter (IC), and the interdigitating microelectrodes. This device was successfully used to observe the changes in the metabolism and proliferation of L929 cells at different stages of cell growth with low cell concentrations. Further, the portable impedance measurement device is a useful analytical tool for monitoring cell growth. It will integrate easily with wireless circuits for applications in aseptic cell biology.

Selecting a subset of the parameters for estimation is one common approach to deal with this problem. One popular method sequentially selects parameters based on orthogonalization of the sensitivity vectors; however, it has the drawback that only one parameter is added at each step of the iteration and that no correlations of not yet chosen parameters can be taken into account. To address this drawback, a generalization of the parameter set selection procedure based on orthogonalization is presented in this work. The procedure can add any number of parameters at each iteration such that correlations among the parameters that will be added to the set of estimated parameters can be taken into account. It is shown that two existing parameter set selection techniques form special cases of the presented method.

In the cellular immune response this exchange governs the magnitude and breadth of killing of cellular targets, inflammation or tolerance. Paracrine delivery is examined here by solving the steady-state diffusion equation for the concentration field surrounding two intensely interacting, equi-sized cells on which surface kinetics limits the rates of factor emission and absorption. These chemical factors may be cytokines, such as Interlukins and Interferons, but the results are presented in a generic form so as to be applicable to any chemical factor and/or cell-type interaction. In addition to providing overall transfer rates and transfer efficiencies, the results also indicate that when the receiving cell is naive, with few factor receptors on its surface, there may be a significant accumulation of factor in the synaptic region between the cells with a consequent release of factor to the medium where it can signal bystander cells. This factor accumulation may play a critical role in activating a naive receiving cell. As the receiving cell activates and becomes more absorbent, the factor accumulation diminishes, as does potential bystander signaling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ability to modify and reprogramme natural biology increases the scope of tailored bioprocesses and yields attractive prospects beyond conventional Biotechnology. The present review summarises the major achievements and categorises them according to a hierarchy of system levels. Similar structures are known in the engineering sciences and might prove useful for the future development of Synthetic Biology. The hierarchy encompasses several levels of detail. Biological (macro-)molecules present the most detailed level (parts), followed by compartmentalised or non-compartmentalised modules (devices). In the next level, parts and devices are combined into functional cells and further into cellular communities. The manifold interactions between biological entities of the same hierarchical level or between different levels are accounted for by networks, primarily metabolic pathways and regulatory circuits. Networks of different types are represented as a superordinate hierarchical level that achieves full system integration. On all these levels, extensive and sound scientific foundations exist regarding experimental but also theoretical methods. These have led to diverse manifestations of Synthetic Biology on the parts and devices levels. Investigations involving synthetic components on the systems scale represent the most difficult and remain limited in number. A main challenge lies with the quantitative prediction of interactions between different entities across different scales. Systems-theoretical approaches provide important tools to analyse complex biological behaviour and can support the design of artificial biological systems. A promising strategy is seen in an efficient modularisation that reduces biological systems to a limited set of functional modules with well-characterised interfaces. For the design of synthetic biological systems the interactions across these interfaces should be standardised to reduce complexity. Yet, the identification of modules and standardised interaction routes remains a non-trivial problem. Furthermore, an appropriate platform that efficiently describes replication and evolutionary processes has to be developed in order to extend the achievements of Synthetic Biology into designed biological processes.

Besides direct clearance, hydrological alterations, climatic changes or insect infestations, chemical pollution could be a significant contributor of mangrove degradation. The present paper reviews the current knowledge on the occurrence, bioavailability and toxic effects of trace contaminants in mangrove ecosystems. The literature confirmed that trace metals, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Endocrine Disrupters Compounds (EDCs) have been detected in various mangrove compartments (water, sediments and biota). In some cases, these chemicals have associated toxic effects on mangrove ecosystem species, with potential impact on populations and biodiversity in the field. However, nearly all studies about the bioavailability and toxic effects of contaminants in mangrove ecosystems focus on selected trace metals, PAHs or some ""conventional"" POPs, and virtually no data exist for other contaminant groups. The specificities of mangrove ecosystems (e.g. biology, physico-chemistry and hydrology) support the need for specific ecotoxicological tools. This review highlights the major data and methodological gaps which should be addressed to refine the risk assessment of trace pollutants in mangrove ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that: (1) Sodium bisulfite relaxed rat thoracic aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner (from 100 to 4000 mu M); however, sodium sulfite at 500 and 1000 mu M caused vasoconstriction, and only at higher concentrations (from 2000 to 4000 mu M) it caused vasorelaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. (2) The vasorelaxation caused by the bisulfite at low concentrations (<= 500 mu M) was endothelium-dependent, but at high concentrations (>= 1000 mu M) it was endothelium-independent. (3) The vasorelaxation by the bisulfite at the low concentrations was partially mediated by the cGMP pathway and the vasorelaxation was related to big-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel, but not due to prostaglandin, protein kinase C (PKC) and cAMP pathways. (4) The vasorelaxation by the bisulfite at high concentrations was partially inhibited by tetraethylammonium (TEA) and glibenclamide, suggesting that the vasorelaxation was related to ATP-sensitive K+ channel (K-ATP) and L-type calcium-channel. These results led to the conclusion that bisulfite (HSO3-) might be a vasoactive factor and sodium bisulfite can be used as a SO2 donor for the study of SO2 biology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The continuous addition of the PF to the cultivated soil accumulates the radionuclides in the land and increases the level of radioactivity in the soil. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the enhanced level of accumulated radioactivity due to the continuous addition of the PF in the farmlands of Nuclear Institute of Agriculture and Biology (NIAB) at Faisalabad in Pakistan. The selected study area consisted of the highly fertilized farmlands and an unfertilized barren land of the NIAB.The understudy area is very fertile for the growth of various types of crops; therefore, four agricultural research institutes have been established at Faisalabad and NIAB is one of those. The NIAB has developed various research farmlands at different places in Pakistan. The crop yield has been increased by adding various fertilizers in the farmlands. The addition of the PF accompanied with the radionuclides enhances radioactivity in the fields. Human being is exposed directly or indirectly to this radiological hazard. A prolong exposure may become a cause of health risk.The area of study consisted of three types of lands: the land under cultivation for the last 40 and 30 years called Site 1 and Site 2, respectively, and the barren land was called Site 3. A total of 75 soil samples were collected within the crop rooting zone (up to 25 cm deep) of the soil of the NIAB farms. The samples were dried, pulverized to powder, sealed in plastic containers, and stored to achieve equilibrium between Ra-226 and Rn-222. Activity concentrations of the radionuclides U-238 (Ra-226), Th-232, and K-40 in soil samples were determined by using a high resolution gamma ray spectrometry system, consisting of an high purity germanium detector coupled through a spectroscopy amplifier with a PC based MCA installed with Geni-2000 software.The measured activity concentration levels of K-40 were 662 +/- 15, 615 +/- 17, and 458 +/- 20 Bq kg(-1), Ra-226 were 48 +/- 6, 43 +/- 5, and 26 +/- 4 Bq kg(-1), and that of Th-232 were 39 +/- 5, 37 +/- 5, 35 +/- 5 Bq kg(-1), respectively, in the soil of the Sites 1, 2, and 3. Gamma dose rate 1 m above the soil surface was 55, 51, and 40 nGy h(-1) from Sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively. External dose rates in the rooms constructed of the bricks made of the soil from Sites 1, 2, and 3 were 161, 149, and 114 nGyh(-1), respectively.Activity concentration values of K-40 and Ra-226 in the soil of Sites 1 and 2 were higher than that in the soil of Site 3. The relative rise of K-40 was 43 % and 34 % and that of Ra-226 was 85 % and 65 % respectively in these sites. Activity concentrations of Th-232 in all these sites were in the background range. Gamma dose rate 1 m above soil surface of Sites 1 and 2 was 40 % and 30 % respectively higher than that from the soil of Site 3. The rise in activity of K-40 and Ra-226 and gamma dose from the Site 1 was greater than that from the Site 2. The least activity and dose were observed from the Site 3. Gamma dose in the dwellings made of fertilized soil bricks of Site 1 and Site 2 were respectively calculated to be 41 % and 32 % higher than that in the abodes made of unfertilized soil bricks of Site 3.Activity concentrations of Ra-226 and K-40 were observed to be enhanced in the fertilized farmlands of the NIAB. Outdoor and indoor gamma dose as radiological hazard were found to be increasing with the continuous addition of PF in the understudy farmlands.It is recommended that naturally occurring radioactive metal should be removed during the process of manufacturing of the PF from the PR.The rise in radioactivity in the farmlands due to the addition of the PF can be a source of direct or indirect exposure to radiation that may enhance cancer risk of the exposed individuals.

Of more recent vintage has been the appreciation that an alternative outcome of benzene exposure has been the development of one or more types of leukemia. While many investigators agree that the array of toxic metabolites, generated in the liver or in the bone marrow, can lead to traumatic bone marrow injury, the more subtle mechanisms leading to leukemia have yet to be critically dissected. This problem appears to have more general interest because of the recognition that so-called ""second cancer"" that results from prior treatment with alkylating agents to yield tumor remissions, often results in a type of leukemia reminiscent of benzene-induced leukemia. Furthermore, there is a growing literature attempting to characterize the fine structure of the marrow and the identification of so called "" niches"" that house a variety of stem cells and other types of cells. Some of these "" niches"" may harbor cells capable of initiating leukemias. The control of stem cell differentiation and proliferation via both inter-and intra-cellular signaling will ultimately determine the fate of these transformed stem cells. The ability of these cells to avoid checkpoints that would prevent them from contributing to the leukemogenic response is an additional area for study. Much of the study of benzene-induced bone marrow damage has concentrated on determining which of the benzene metabolites lead to leukemogenesis. The emphasis now should be directed to understanding how benzene metabolites alter bone marrow cell biology.

It was previously shown to affect various aspects of reproductive biology in aquatic vertebrates, however, evidence for MDHT affecting mating behavior of aquatic vertebrate species is lacking. In order to test the assumption that MDHT affects reproductive behavior of aquatic vertebrates, we exposed male and female Xenopus laevis to three environmentally relevant concentrations of MDHT (30.45 ng L-1, 3.05 mu g L-1 and 30.45 mu g L-1). In males, MDHT at all concentrations led to enhanced levels of advertisement calling and decreased the relative proportions of rasping, a call type characterizing a sexually unaroused state of the male, indicating an increase in sexual arousal of MDHT exposed males. Temporal and spectral parameters of the advertisement call itself, however, were not affected by MDHT exposure. In females, MDHT (30.45 ng L-1) did not have any effects, while MDHT at 3.05 mu g L-1 increased female receptivity, increased the duration of time females spent close to the speaker playing male advertisement calls and reduced their latency to respond. MDHT at 30.45 mu g L-1, on the other hand, decreased female receptivity and increased their latency to respond. In summary, this study illustrates that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of the androgenic EDC MDHT affects male and female mating behavior of X. laevis. Hence, we suggest that nonaromatizable androgens might play a direct and predominant role in the physiology and regulation of reproduction not only in male but also in female frogs.

In addition to the various adverse effects that have been seen for different organisms. ENP are suspected to influence the transport, bioavailability and toxic properties of a range of environmental contaminants that may adsorb to their surface. In this study, the binding properties of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene to stabilized silver and gold ENP were investigated using a novel mass balance based single-equilibrium approach. Only citrate coated gold ENP (AuNPCIT) were found to bind phenanthrene. No binding was observed for polyvinylpyrolidone coated silver ENP (AgNPPVP) nor citrate coated silver ENP (AgNPCIT) suggesting that the properties of the core material have a major influence on binding reactions. A binding coefficient K-b was defined as the ratio between the concentration of phenanthrene associated to the AuNPCIT and that freely dissolved in the exposure medium. Temperature was not seen to significantly influence K-b within an environmentally relevant range (4-25 degrees C). The presence of methanol significantly reduced or prevented the formation of the AuNPCIT-phenathrene complex. Results suggest that the binding is a low energy physio-sorption, likely associated to a partial displacement or specific arrangement of the citrate capping on the gold core. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, the International Maritime Organization banned new maritime applications of these products on January 1, 2003 and their presence on ship hulls from January 1, 2008. Although extensively studied in Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia, environmental levels and effects of organotin contamination are still poorly known for South America. Thus, the current review aimed to present the actual status of this problem in South America by summarizing and comparing the available data in the literature. An overview of the OTs concentrations in sediment and biota and their effects, mainly imposex in marine gastropods, are presented. This work showed that in Atlantic coastal areas of South America there are ""hot spots"" of OTs contamination, similar to that observed in industrialized countries of Northern Hemisphere. On the other hand, the number of accomplished studies in the Pacific coast is extremely low. Despite the limitation on studies about OTs environmental levels and their related effects, the available data pointed out for a widespread TBT contamination along the South American coastal areas. Therefore, the establishment of baselines of organotin contamination in the Pacific coast and the implementation of temporal trend studies in the South American coastal areas is crucial to verify the effectiveness of local regulations and OTs global ban, and to map the most sensitive areas related to present and future antifouling impacts.
