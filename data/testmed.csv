Depending upon the discipline, complex systems theory has accrued many flavors. We are after a formal representation, a model that can predict the outcome of a complex adaptive system (CAS). In this article, we look at the nature of complexity, then provide a perspective based on discrete event systems (DEVS) theory. We pin down many of the shared features between CAS and artificial systems. We begin with an overview of network science showing how adaptive behavior in these scale-free networks can lead to emergence through stigmergy in CAS. We also address how both self-organization and emergence interplay in a CAS. We then build a case for the view that stigmergic systems are a special case of CAS. We then discuss DEVS levels of systems specifications and present the dynamic structure extensions of DEVS formalism that lends itself to a study of CAS and in turn, stigmergy. Finally, we address the shortcomings and the limitation of current DEVS extensions and propose the required augmentation to model stigmergy and CAS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.

Objective: This article aims to review what is known about the pathogenesis of PIH secondary to external insults and its relationship to the resultant degree of quantitative changes in melanocytes.

Methods: We performed a review of articles exploring PIH resulting from external cutaneous insults retrieved through database searching. We reviewed relevant articles for the pathogenesis, histopathology, and quantitative changes in melanocytes related to specific etiologies of PIH. Methodologies to quantify pigmentation changes in dermatologic conditions with clinical hyperpigmentation were also explored.

Results: Significant increases in melanocyte counts of irritant affected skin is seen compared with melanocyte counts of unaffected skin. An increase in melanocyte counts was also found for spontaneous inflammatory dermatoses, even in the absence of clinical hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, changes in melanocyte density and appearance are also seen secondary to inflammation. In addition, increases in epidermal melanocytes are seen with cutaneous exposure to certain agents, and melanocyte increases vary by exposure agent.

Conclusions: The degree of hyperpigmentation related to the intensity and duration of exposure to the causative factors of PIH is essential to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease process. The application of new methodologies to determine quantitative changes in melanocytes elicited by specific causative inflammatory agents has implications to prevent PIH, add to knowledge about disease duration, to develop better treatments for PIH, and to aid our understanding of the biology of the melanocyte.

The contribution of AnxA1 to human cell biology is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of AnxA1 and its receptor, formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), to the regulation of inflammatory responses in human normal lung fibroblasts (NLF). Silencing constitutive AnxA1 expression in NLF using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with moderate but significant increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced proliferation and interleukin (IL)-6 production, accompanied by reduction of ERK and NF-kappa B activity. AnxA1 regulation of ERK and NF-kappa B activation was associated with effects on proliferation. Blocking FPR2 using the specific antagonist WRW4 mimicked the effects of AnxA1 silencing on TNF-induced proliferation, IL-6, ERK, and NF-kappa B activation. AnxA1 silencing also impaired inhibitory effects of glucocorticoid on IL-6 production and on the expression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), but blocking FPR2 failed to mimic these effects of AnxA1 silencing. These data suggest that AnxA1 regulates TNF-induced proliferation and inflammatory responses in lung fibroblasts, via effects on the ERK and NF-kappa B pathways, which depend on FPR2. AnxA1 also mediates effects of glucocorticoids and GILZ expression, but these effects appear independent of FPR2. These findings suggest that mimicking AnxA1 actions might have therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory lung diseases. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 476484, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Firstly, we prove global existence of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem without any smallness assumption on the initial data. Secondly, we prove both global existence and asymptotic behavior of smooth solutions, provided the initial data are of small H-1-norm energy but possibly large H-s-norm energy. Finally, if the H-s boolean AND L-1-norm of initial data are sufficiently small, we also establish decay rates of the global smooth solutions. These results are obtained by constructing a new nonnegative convex entropy and combining spectral analysis with energy methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was motivated by some problems arising from computational biology, for reverse engineering the structure of mechanisms in gene regulatory networks. For this purpose polynomial expressions have to be generated, which match known state combinations observed during experiments. Earlier approaches using Grobner techniques have not been powerful enough to treat real-world applications.

The proposed method avoids expensive Grobner basis computations completely by directly calculating reduced normal forms. The problem statement can be described by Boolean polynomials, i.e. polynomials with coefficients in {0, 1} and a degree bound of one for each variable. Therefore, the reference implementations mentioned in this work are built on the top of the POLYBORI framework, which has been designed exclusively for the treatment of this special class of polynomials.

A series of randomly generated examples is used to demonstrate the performance of the direct method. It is also compared with other approaches, which incorporate Grobner basis computations.

The most frequent type, clear-cell carcinoma, is not homogenous regarding gene mutations or transcriptomic profiles, but the biologic classifications are not yet mature. Therefore, biologically driven strategies of treatment have not yet been developed in the clinical setting. The choice of first-line agent currently depends on the prognostic criteria published by Motzer et al. [J Clin Oncol 1999;17:2530-2540] and recently by Heng et al. [J Clin Oncol 2009;27:5794-5799], with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies for good- or intermediate-prognosis groups and anti-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for poor-risk patients. In the past years, biological changes leading to resistance to targeted agents have been widely investigated. Discoveries resulted in the development of second-generation VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, characterized by an improved potency and selectivity. Besides, co-inhibition of signalling pathways mediating resistance to anti-VEGF are being developed targeting fibroblast growth factor and c-Met. Dual mTOR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors have greater efficacy than rapalogs in preclinical models and are being investigated in early clinical trials. In conclusion, the changing landscape in the biology and treatment of kidney cancer offers new opportunities for clinicians to treat patients, but, due to relatively high costs, the use of targeted therapies will likely be strongly controlled by health authorities.

In contrast, lineage committed cells acquire an extended symmetrical cell cycle. Self-renewal of tissue-specific stem cells is sustained by asymmetric cell division where one progeny cell remains a progenitor while the partner progeny cell exits the cell cycle and differentiates. There are three principal contexts for considering the operation and regulation of the pluripotent cell cycle: temporal, regulatory, and structural. The primary temporal context that the pluripotent self-renewal cell cycle of hESCs is a short G1 period without reducing periods of time allocated to S phase, G2, and mitosis. The rules that govern proliferation in hESCs remain to be comprehensively established. However, several lines of evidence suggest a key role for the naive transcriptome of hESCs, which is competent to stringently regulate the embryonic stem cell (ESC) cell cycle. This supports the requirements of pluripotent cells to self-propagate while suppressing expression of genes that confer lineage commitment and/or tissue specificity. However, for the first time, we consider unique dimensions to the architectural organization and assembly of regulatory machinery for gene expression in nuclear microenviornments that define parameters of pluripotency. From both fundamental biological and clinical perspectives, understanding control of the abbreviated ESC cycle can provide options to coordinate control of proliferation versus differentiation. Wound healing, tissue engineering, and cell-based therapy to mitigate developmental aberrations illustrate applications that benefit from knowledge of the biology of the pluripotent cell cycle. J.

A special form of this equation is the Hutchinson-Wright equation which is a mile stone in the mathematical modeling of population dynamics and mathematical biology. Taking the delay parameter as a bifurcation parameter, Hopf bifurcation analysis is studied by following the theory in the book by Hazzard et al. By analyzing the associated characteristic polynomial, we determine necessary conditions for the linear stability and Hopf bifurcation. In addition to this analysis, the direction of bifurcation, the stability and the period of a periodic solution to this equation are evaluated at a bifurcation value by using the Poincare normal form and the center manifold theorem.

The sensing behaviour of probe 1 was studied by UV-Vis and flourescence spectroscopy. Probe 1 showed excellent high selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg2+ over commonly coexistent metal ions in neutral solution, which could be attributed to the Hg2+-triggered ring opening of the spirolactam of the rhodamine moiety and the formation of a 1:1 1-Hg2+ complex.

The pathobiological mechanisms of human AAA are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to identify novel pathways involved in the development of AAAs. Methods: A custom-designed 'AAA-chip' was used to assay 43 of the differentially expressed genes identified in a previously published microarray study between AAA (n = 15) and control (n = 15) infrarenal abdominal aorta. Protein analyses were performed on selected genes. Results: Altogether 38 of the 43 genes on the 'AAA-chip' showed significantly different expression. Novel validated genes in AAA pathobiology included ADCY7, ARL4C, BLNK, FOSB, GATM, LYZ, MFGE8, PRUNE2, PTPRC, SMTN, TMODI and TPM2. These genes represent a wide range of biological functions, such as calcium signaling, development and differentiation, as well as cell adhesion not previously implicated in AAA pathobiology. Protein analyses for GATM, CD4, CXCR4, BLNK, PLEK, LYZ, FOSB, DUSP6, ITGA5 and PTPRC confirmed the mRNA findings. Conclusion: The results provide new directions for future research into AAA pathogenesis to study the role of novel genes confirmed here.

The groups were daughter cells with no bud scars, and mother cells separated further by number of scars (one, two and more than two). Cells with more than three scars were very rare.

Compression testing by micromanipulation was used to determine key mechanical properties of the sorted cells. For all cells the force and fractional deformation at bursting could be determined. For 69% of cells overall but only 32% of daughter cells, a large strain mathematical model using a linear elastic constitutive equation for the wall material could be fitted to force deformation data up to cell wall failure. For these cells, the wall surface modulus, elastic modulus, initial stretch ratio and strain energy per unit volume at bursting could be estimated. For the remainder of the cells, the lack of permanent deformation on repeated compression and release (at deformations not causing bursting) suggested the cell wall material was non-linear elastic but with no observable plastic behaviour.

This is the first report to show directly that bud scars affect the global mechanical properties of yeast cells and that the important distinction with respect to scars is between daughter and mother cells. The former were smaller with more elastic walls and a higher mean initial stretch ratio. For cells for which the model could be fitted, the mean circumferential strain at bursting decreased with scarring (consistent with stiffer walls) whilst the stress increased. This may be due to the reported absence of chitin in the walls of daughter cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

NO is synthesized by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and often functions through its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG). This study combined NO imaging, immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology to localize NO and its downstream signaling pathways in the mouse retina. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) was localized primarily in puncta in the inner plexiform layer, in amacrine cells, and in somata in the ganglion cell layer. Endothelial NOS was in blood vessels. Light-stimulated NO production imaged with diaminofluorescein was present in somata in the inner nuclear layer and in synaptic boutons in the inner plexiform layer. The downstream target of NO, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), was in somata in the inner and outer nuclear layers and in both plexiform layers. Cyclic GMP immunocytochemistry was used functionally to localize sGC that was activated by an NO donor in amacrine, bipolar, and ganglion cells. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) Ia was found in bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and both plexiform layers, whereas PKG II was found in the outer plexiform layer, amacrine cells, and somata in the ganglion cell layer. This study shows that the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is functional and widely distributed in specific cell types in the outer and inner mouse retina. A better understanding of these signaling pathways in normal retina will provide a firm basis for targeting their roles in retinal pathology. J. Comp. Neurol. 520:42044217, 2012.

The current manuscript presents an analysis of multi-scale interactions involved in D. discoideum aggregation and non-aggregation events. The multi-scale fractal dimensions of a sequence of microscope images were used to estimate changing structure at different spatial scales. Three regions showing aggregation and three showing non-aggregation were considered. The results showed that both aggregation and non-aggregation regions were strongly multi-fractal. Analyses of the over-time relationships among nine scales of the generalized dimension, D(q), were conducted using vector autoregression and vector error-correction models. Both types of regions showed evidence that across-scale interactions serve to maintain the equilibrium of the system. Aggregation and non-aggregation regions also showed different patterns of effects of individual scales on other scales. Specifically, aggregation regions showed greater effects of both the smallest and largest scales on the smaller scale structures. The results suggest that multi-scale interactions are responsible for maintaining and altering the cellular structures during aggregation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We encourage the incorporation of new sensors and new energy sources within the operational environment of UK-sustained observational programmes to bridge the gap that normally separates laboratory prototype from operational instrument. For interpreting the climate-change records obtained through a variety of national and international sustained observational programmes, creative and dedicated UK scientists should lead efforts to extract the meaningful signals and patterns of climate change and to interpret them so as to project future changes.

UK researchers have authored articles of high impact in all areas described here. In contrast to terrestrial geoscience, however, there have been few instrumented observations made of active processes by UK scientists. This is an area that could be developed over the next decades in the UK. Research on active processes has the potential ability to engage the wider public: Some active processes present significant geo-hazards to populations and offshore infrastructure that require monitoring and there could be commercial applications of technological developments needed for science. Some of the suggestions could involve studies in shallow coastal waters where ship costs are much reduced, addressing tighter funding constraints over the near term. The possibilities of measuring aspects of volcanic eruptions, flowing lava, turbidity currents and mass movements (landslides) are discussed. A further area of potential development is in greater collaboration between the ocean sciences. For example, it is well known in terrestrial geomorphology that biological agents are important in modulating erosion and the transport of sediments, ultimately affecting the shape of the Earth's surface in various ways. The analogous effect of biology on large-scale geomorphology in the oceans is also known but remains poorly quantified. Physical oceanographic models are becoming increasingly accurate and could be used to study further the patterns of erosion, particle transport and deposition in the oceans. Marine geological and geophysical data could in turn be useful for further verification of such models.

It is considered essential that computational model-building activities be at the centre of the initiative, driving an iterative process of development, testing and refinement. It is critical that the models provide mechanistic understanding and quantitative predictions. The aim would be to predict effects in humans: in order to help define a challenging but yet feasible initial goal the focus would be on liver mitochondrial toxicity.

Fibrillar collagen in the vascular wall plays a central role in tissue adaptation owing to its relatively short lifetime. Pathological alterations of collagen turnover may fail to result in homeostasis and could be responsible for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth at later stages of the disease. For this reason our previously reported multiscale constitutive framework (Martufi, G. & Gasser, T. C. 2011 J. Biomech. 44, 2544-2550 (doi:10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.07.015)) has been enriched by a collagen turnover model. Specifically, the framework's collagen fibril level allowed a sound integration of vascular wall biology, and the impact of collagen turnover on the macroscopic properties of AAAs was studied. To this end, model parameters were taken from the literature and/or estimated from clinical follow-up data of AAAs (on average 50.7 mm-large). Likewise, the in vivo stretch of the AAA wall was set, such that 10 per cent of collagen fibres were engaged. Results showed that the stretch spectrum, at which collagen fibrils are deposed, is the most influential parameter, i.e. it determines whether the vascular geometry grows, shrinks or remains stable over time. Most importantly, collagen turnover also had a remarkable impact on the macroscopic stress field. It avoided high stress gradients across the vessel wall, thus predicted a physiologically reasonable stress field. Although the constitutive model could be successfully calibrated to match the growth of small AAAs, a rigorous validation against experimental data is crucial to further explore the model's descriptive and predictive capabilities.

We used those flow fields to characterize the aerodynamic footprint in unprecedented detail and revealed previously unseen wake elements that would have gone undetected by two-dimensional or stereo-imaging technology. Vortex iso-surface topographies show the spatio-temporal signature of aerodynamic force generation manifest in the wake of locusts, and expose the extent to which animal wakes can deform, potentially leading to unreliable calculations of lift and thrust when using conventional diagnostic methods.

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N > 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.

The gradient has been hypothesized to be dependent on the biology of the wasps, but recently questions of sampling and description biases have been raised. Here, we show with primary data that the species richness of Ichneumonidae is markedly underestimated in tropical areas and that latitudinal diversity patterns in the family remain uncharacterized. We discovered a startling 177 likely undescribed orthocentrine species with relatively low sampling effort in the forests of Central America and Amazonian Ecuador, over three times the previously known orthocentrine diversity in the world's tropics. Species accumulation curves reveal that we are just beginning to unveil the true extent of tropical orthocentrine diversity. We also found evidence for cryptic species; our DNA analysis revealed additional species not easily distinguishable using morphological characteristics. The difficulty in establishing species richness patterns of Ichneumonidae probably follows from the relative lack of taxonomic expertise and the low density of ichneumonid species throughout the landscape.

One topic of intense interest is the search of specific behavioural mechanisms at stake at the individual level and from which the school properties emerges. This is fundamental for understanding how selective pressure acting at the individual level promotes adaptive properties of schools and in trying to disambiguate functional properties from non-adaptive epiphenomena. Decades of studies on collective motion by means of individual-based modelling have allowed a qualitative understanding of the self-organization processes leading to collective properties at school level, and provided an insight into the behavioural mechanisms that result in coordinated motion. Here, we emphasize a set of paradigmatic modelling assumptions whose validity remains unclear, both from a behavioural point of view and in terms of quantitative agreement between model outcome and empirical data. We advocate for a specific and biologically oriented re-examination of these assumptions through experimental-based behavioural analysis and modelling.

Motility of the rod-shaped cells of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus depends on two motility machineries, type IV pili (giving rise to S-motility) and the gliding motility apparatus (giving rise to A-motility). Cell motility is regulated by occasional reversals. Moving M. xanthus cells can organize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies, depending on their nutritional status. To ultimately understand these two pattern-formation processes and the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as the cell reversal machinery, we analyse spatial self-organization in three M. xanthus strains: (i) a mutant that moves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, (ii) a unidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and (iii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, occasionally reverses its direction of movement. The mutant moving by means of the A-engine illustrates that collective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding bacteria owing to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need of invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant reveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are present, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the study of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces the formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while it results in vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are consistent with what is known from self-propelled rod models, which strongly suggests that the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions is the pattern-formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. On the other hand, we learn that when cells occasionally reverse their moving direction, as observed in the wild-type, cells form small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like structure at high enough densities. These results have been obtained from a careful analysis of the cluster statistics of ensembles of cells, and analysed in the light of a coagulation Smoluchowski equation with fragmentation.

Information about these interactions can improve our understanding of diseases and provide the basis to revolutionize therapeutic treatments. However, current experimental techniques for large-scale detection of protein-protein interactions are biased against membrane proteins, it is necessary to develop novel tools to deal with this kind of bio-network. To realize this, we construct membrane protein interaction network based on gene regulatory network model. Three model forms, basic form, non-dimensionalization form, and more complex form, are proposed to understand the dynamic and collective control of developmental process and the characters of membrane protein interaction network, including small-world network, scale free distributing and robustness, and its significance for biology. Four simulation examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and flexibility of the GRN model method for the study of membrane protein interaction network. The results show that the proposed approach holds a high potential to become a useful tool in prediction of membrane protein interactions. Moreover, it has biological significance and value for biology and pharmacology. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sulfated fucans (SFs) and sulfated galactans (SGs) are one of these classes of glycans with increasing interest to both glycomics and medicine. Besides having very unique structures, some of these molecules exhibit a broad range of pharmacological actions. In certain cases, high levels of effectiveness may be reached when the proper structural requirements are found.

Scope of review: Here, we cover the fundamental biochemical mechanisms of some of these medicinal properties. We particularly focus on the beneficial activities of SFs and SGs in inflammation, hemostasis, vascular biology, and cancer.

Major conclusions: In these clinical systems. intermolecular complexes directly driven by electrostatic interactions of SFs and SGs with P- and L-selectins, chemokines, antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, thrombin, factor Xa, bFGF, and VEGF, overall govern the resultant therapeutic effects. In spite of that, the structural features of SFs and SGs have shown to be essential determinants for formation and stability of those molecular complexes, which consequently account to the differential levels of the biomedical responses.

General significance: Accurate structure-function relationships have mostly been achieved when SFs and SGs of well-defined structures are used for study. Therefore, these types of glycans have become of great usefulness to identify the chemical requirements needed to achieve satisfactory clinical responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

G-rich sequences are able to form quadruplex structures that have been proved to be involved in several important biological processes.

Methods: In this paper, we report investigations, based on calorimetric, UV, CD and electrophoretic techniques, on 12 oligodeoxynucleotides analogues of the quadruplex forming human telomere sequence d[TA(G(3)T(2)A)(3)G(3)], in which each guanine has been replaced, one at a time, by an abasic site mimic.

Results: Although all data show that the modified sequences preserve their ability to form quadruplex structures, the thermodynamic parameters clearly indicate that the presence of an abasic site decreases their thermal stability compared to the parent unmodified sequence, particularly if the replacement concerns one of the guanosines involved in the formation of the central G-tetrad.

Conclusions: The collected data indicate that the effects of the presence of abasic site lesions in telomeric quadruplex structures are site-specific. The most dramatic consequences come out when this lesion involves a guanosine in the centre of a G-run.

General significance: Abasic sites, by facilitating the G-quadruplex disruption, could favour the formation of the telomerase primer. Furthermore they could have implications in the pharmacological approach targeting telomere. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With rapid alterations of ecosystems occurring across the globe, organisms are being faced with sensory challenges that result in behavioural changes and disruptions with potential population-level consequences. Through a consideration of sensory ecology, it is possible to identify the underlying causes of disturbances at the individual level and use this information to develop better-informed, highly targeted, and more effective management strategies. Indeed, sensory-based approaches have already been successful in response to a variety of conservation issues. This article provides a general discussion of how a consideration of sensory ecology can benefit conservation biology and proceeds to describe three areas of rapid growth and potential for expansion: (1) mitigation of anthropogenic noise disturbance; (2) prevention and amelioration of ecological and other evolutionary traps; (3) targeted population control with special attention to aquatic invasive species.

Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations. The approaches presented here illustrate feasible ways to incorporate the ecosystem functioning dimension into conservation through the use of satellite-derived information.

The focus in process improvement is often on understanding and manipulating the regulation of metabolism. Nonetheless, one encounters situations where organisms are remarkably resilient to further optimization or their properties become unstable. Therefore it is important to understand the origin of these apparent limitations to find whether and how they can be improved. We argue that by considering fitness effects of regulation, a more generic explanation for certain behaviour can be obtained. In this view, apparent process limitations arise from trade-offs that cells faced as they evolved to improve fitness. A deeper understanding of such trade-offs using a systems biology approach can ultimately enhance performance of cell factories.

The historical reduction in abundance and geographic distribution of the American plains bison (Bison bison bison) and their recovery over the last 125 years is well documented. However, introgression from domestic cattle (Bos taurus) into the few remaining bison populations that existed in the late 1800s has now been identified in many modern bison herds. We examined the phenotypic effect of this ancestry by comparing weight and height of bison with cattle or bison mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Santa Catalina Island, California (U.S.A.), a nutritionally stressful environment for bison, and of a group of age-matched feedlot bison males in Montana, a nutritionally rich environment. The environmental and nutritional differences between these 2 bison populations were very different and demonstrated the phenotypic effect of domestic cattle mtDNA in bison over a broad range of conditions. For example, the average weight of feedlot males that were 2 years of age was 2.54 times greater than that of males from Santa Catalina Island. In both environments, bison with cattle mtDNA had lower weight compared with bison with bison mtDNA, and on Santa Catalina Island, the height of bison with cattle mtDNA was lower than the height of bison with bison mtDNA. These data support the hypothesis that body size is smaller and height is lower in bison with domestic cattle mtDNA and that genomic integrity is important for the conservation of the American plains bison.

To identify virulence-associated genes to improve the biocontrol efficacy of M. acridum, it is necessary to understand the genes expressed by M. acridum during its infection of the insect host cuticle. In this study, we performed a large scale gene expression analysis of M. acridum during locust cuticle infection. We report the identification of 4,739 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 80 % have not been previously identified. Analysis of the ESTs provided evidence that M. acridum may employ several different adaptation strategies to infect locust cuticle, such as metabolism reprogramming, protein secretion, endocytosis, cell-cycle-regulated morphogenesis and effector-dependent suppression of host immune responses. By searching against the pathogen-host interaction database, several genes associated with different adaptation processes were found to potentially encode important virulence genes. Gene expression pattern analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that M. acridum differentially regulates subsets of genes in response to different infection niches between the host cuticle and hemolymph. The present study provides novel candidate genes to investigate the biology of insect infection by M. acridum.

This issue of Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology is focused on primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Like every disorder, PID has its own specific history, starting with the discovery of agammaglobulinemia in 1952 and still expanding at a rapid pace, covering, at the time of this publication, more than 180 genetically determined disorders. However, as this report attempts to demonstrate, the history of PID is intertwined with the development of modern medicine and is the direct result of the innovative thinking of physician scientists who introduced new concepts in pathology, microbiology, biochemistry, and immunology, based on carefully designed experiments. As a consequence of the novel ideas put forth in the late 19th century, progress in public health, the discovery of antimicrobials, and the utilization of biologic products led to the recognition of genetically determined defects of Immunity and the design of effective treatment strategies.

Recent findings

The discovery of the structure of DNA, its replication, and the mapping of the human genome has transformed the field of PID into a predictable science of cutting edge therapies and diagnostic concepts.

However, data on the early stages of developing stereotypies are currently scarce. We compared the development of stereotypic route-tracing and somersaulting in hand-reared and wild-caught starlings placed in individual cages for the first time. We found that wild-caught birds were less active but showed more escape motivation and more evidence of route-tracing behavior. Furthermore, somersaulting was only observed in wild-caught birds. Development of somersaulting was predicted by subtle differences in behavior during the first few days in cages and developed in individuals with low levels of route-tracing behavior. Our data suggest a role for escape motivation in the development of starling stereotypies and additionally that route-tracing and somersaulting may represent alternative outlets for thwarted escape. In contrast to observations from mammals, our results show that stereotypies are more common in wild-caught starlings. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,Inc.

An intriguing aspect is the morphological and ecological similarity between H. pseudoalbidus and the native saprotroph Hymenoscyphus albidus. We revisited four localities where H. albidus apothecia were collected from 1989 to 2005 and established the current relationship of the species in these Danish ash stands based on microsatellites and differences in ITS sequences (used as CAPs marker). Scottish collections from 2010 supported the hypothesis that Danish herbarium samples prior to 2005 are identical to H. albidus still found in Scotland. The markers further revealed that herbarium samples from 1989 to 1994 were all H. albidus, while the latest collection (2005) was H. pseudoalbidus, which coincides with the first Danish symptom observations. Collections from 2010 were purely H. pseudoalbidus. We suggest that expanding H. pseudoalbidus excludes H. albidus from its niche resulting in H. albidus becoming a rare species in Denmark, which is perhaps already locally extinct.

A thorough knowledge of the biology of barnyardgrass is fundamental for designing effective resistance-management programmes. In the present study, seed production of barnyardgrass in response to time of emergence was investigated in cotton and rice, respectively, in Fayetteville and Rohwer, Arkansas, over a 2-year period (2008-09). Barnyardgrass seed production was greater when seedlings emerged with the crop, but some seed production was observed even if seedlings emerged several weeks after crop emergence. Moreover, barnyardgrass seed production was highly variable across environments. When emerging with the crop (0 weeks after crop emergence (WAE)), barnyardgrass produced c. 35500 and 16500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 39000 and 2900 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Seed production was observed when seedlings emerged up to 5 WAE (2008) or 7 WAE (2009) in cotton and up to 5 WAE (2008, 2009) in rice; corresponding seed production was c. 2500 and 1500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 14700 and 110 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The results suggest that cultural approaches that delay the emergence of barnyardgrass or approaches that make the associated crop more competitive will be useful in integrated management programmes. In the context of herbicide resistance management, it may be valuable to prevent seed return to the seedbank, irrespective of cohorts.

To address this challenge and maximize the return on the efforts required for validating genomic screen hits, the screening strategy must be designed to increase the robustness of the primary screening hits and include assays that inform on the mechanism of action of the knocked-down transcripts. Here, we describe the implementation of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify genes that sensitize the effect of poly-(ADP ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor on cell survival. In the strategy we designed for the primary screen, two biological activities, apoptosis and cell viability, were measured simultaneously at different time points in the presence and absence of a PARP inhibitor (PARPi). The multiplexed assay allowed us to identify PARPi sensitizers induced by both caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms. The multiplexed screening strategy yielded robust primary hits with significant enrichment for DNA repair genes, which were further validated using relevant high-content imaging assays and confirmation of transcript knockdown by real-time PCR (rtPCR).
