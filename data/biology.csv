Depending upon the discipline, complex systems theory has accrued many flavors. We are after a formal representation, a model that can predict the outcome of a complex adaptive system (CAS). In this article, we look at the nature of complexity, then provide a perspective based on discrete event systems (DEVS) theory. We pin down many of the shared features between CAS and artificial systems. We begin with an overview of network science showing how adaptive behavior in these scale-free networks can lead to emergence through stigmergy in CAS. We also address how both self-organization and emergence interplay in a CAS. We then build a case for the view that stigmergic systems are a special case of CAS. We then discuss DEVS levels of systems specifications and present the dynamic structure extensions of DEVS formalism that lends itself to a study of CAS and in turn, stigmergy. Finally, we address the shortcomings and the limitation of current DEVS extensions and propose the required augmentation to model stigmergy and CAS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology. ", Ophthalmology; Toxicology 
10.3109/15569527.2012.684419,Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation secondary to external insult: an overview of the quantitative analysis of pigmentation,"Abstract: Context: Despite new technologies, few studies have quantified changes in melanocyte numbers associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to exogenous causes.

Objective: This article aims to review what is known about the pathogenesis of PIH secondary to external insults and its relationship to the resultant degree of quantitative changes in melanocytes.

Methods: We performed a review of articles exploring PIH resulting from external cutaneous insults retrieved through database searching. We reviewed relevant articles for the pathogenesis, histopathology, and quantitative changes in melanocytes related to specific etiologies of PIH. Methodologies to quantify pigmentation changes in dermatologic conditions with clinical hyperpigmentation were also explored.

Results: Significant increases in melanocyte counts of irritant affected skin is seen compared with melanocyte counts of unaffected skin. An increase in melanocyte counts was also found for spontaneous inflammatory dermatoses, even in the absence of clinical hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, changes in melanocyte density and appearance are also seen secondary to inflammation. In addition, increases in epidermal melanocytes are seen with cutaneous exposure to certain agents, and melanocyte increases vary by exposure agent.

Conclusions: The degree of hyperpigmentation related to the intensity and duration of exposure to the causative factors of PIH is essential to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease process. The application of new methodologies to determine quantitative changes in melanocytes elicited by specific causative inflammatory agents has implications to prevent PIH, add to knowledge about disease duration, to develop better treatments for PIH, and to aid our understanding of the biology of the melanocyte.

10.1002/jcp.24156,Regulation of lung fibroblast activation by annexin A1,"Abstract: Annexin-A1 (AnxA1) is a glucocorticoid-induced protein with multiple actions in the regulation of inflammatory cell activation. The contribution of AnxA1 to human cell biology is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of AnxA1 and its receptor, formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), to the regulation of inflammatory responses in human normal lung fibroblasts (NLF). Silencing constitutive AnxA1 expression in NLF using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with moderate but significant increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced proliferation and interleukin (IL)-6 production, accompanied by reduction of ERK and NF-kappa B activity. AnxA1 regulation of ERK and NF-kappa B activation was associated with effects on proliferation. Blocking FPR2 using the specific antagonist WRW4 mimicked the effects of AnxA1 silencing on TNF-induced proliferation, IL-6, ERK, and NF-kappa B activation. AnxA1 silencing also impaired inhibitory effects of glucocorticoid on IL-6 production and on the expression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), but blocking FPR2 failed to mimic these effects of AnxA1 silencing. These data suggest that AnxA1 regulates TNF-induced proliferation and inflammatory responses in lung fibroblasts, via effects on the ERK and NF-kappa B pathways, which depend on FPR2. AnxA1 also mediates effects of glucocorticoids and GILZ expression, but these effects appear independent of FPR2. These findings suggest that mimicking AnxA1 actions might have therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory lung diseases. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 476484, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Firstly, we prove global existence of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem without any smallness assumption on the initial data. Secondly, we prove both global existence and asymptotic behavior of smooth solutions, provided the initial data are of small H-1-norm energy but possibly large H-s-norm energy. Finally, if the H-s boolean AND L-1-norm of initial data are sufficiently small, we also establish decay rates of the global smooth solutions. These results are obtained by constructing a new nonnegative convex entropy and combining spectral analysis with energy methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

10.1016/j.jsc.2011.04.002,Grobner-free normal forms for Boolean polynomials,"Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for interpolation of Boolean functions using Boolean polynomials. It was motivated by some problems arising from computational biology, for reverse engineering the structure of mechanisms in gene regulatory networks. For this purpose polynomial expressions have to be generated, which match known state combinations observed during experiments. Earlier approaches using Grobner techniques have not been powerful enough to treat real-world applications.

The proposed method avoids expensive Grobner basis computations completely by directly calculating reduced normal forms. The problem statement can be described by Boolean polynomials, i.e. polynomials with coefficients in {0, 1} and a degree bound of one for each variable. Therefore, the reference implementations mentioned in this work are built on the top of the POLYBORI framework, which has been designed exclusively for the treatment of this special class of polynomials.

A series of randomly generated examples is used to demonstrate the performance of the direct method. It is also compared with other approaches, which incorporate Grobner basis computations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. "," Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied "
10.1159/000342962,New Insights into the Management of Renal Cell Cancer,"Abstract: Kidney cancer is composed of several bio-histological entities. The most frequent type, clear-cell carcinoma, is not homogenous regarding gene mutations or transcriptomic profiles, but the biologic classifications are not yet mature. Therefore, biologically driven strategies of treatment have not yet been developed in the clinical setting. The choice of first-line agent currently depends on the prognostic criteria published by Motzer et al. [J Clin Oncol 1999;17:2530-2540] and recently by Heng et al. [J Clin Oncol 2009;27:5794-5799], with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies for good- or intermediate-prognosis groups and anti-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for poor-risk patients. In the past years, biological changes leading to resistance to targeted agents have been widely investigated. Discoveries resulted in the development of second-generation VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, characterized by an improved potency and selectivity. Besides, co-inhibition of signalling pathways mediating resistance to anti-VEGF are being developed targeting fibroblast growth factor and c-Met. Dual mTOR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors have greater efficacy than rapalogs in preclinical models and are being investigated in early clinical trials. In conclusion, the changing landscape in the biology and treatment of kidney cancer offers new opportunities for clinicians to treat patients, but, due to relatively high costs, the use of targeted therapies will likely be strongly controlled by health authorities.

10.1002/jcp.24104,The abbreviated pluripotent cell cycle,"Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells proliferate rapidly and divide symmetrically producing equivalent progeny cells. In contrast, lineage committed cells acquire an extended symmetrical cell cycle. Self-renewal of tissue-specific stem cells is sustained by asymmetric cell division where one progeny cell remains a progenitor while the partner progeny cell exits the cell cycle and differentiates. There are three principal contexts for considering the operation and regulation of the pluripotent cell cycle: temporal, regulatory, and structural. The primary temporal context that the pluripotent self-renewal cell cycle of hESCs is a short G1 period without reducing periods of time allocated to S phase, G2, and mitosis. The rules that govern proliferation in hESCs remain to be comprehensively established. However, several lines of evidence suggest a key role for the naive transcriptome of hESCs, which is competent to stringently regulate the embryonic stem cell (ESC) cell cycle. This supports the requirements of pluripotent cells to self-propagate while suppressing expression of genes that confer lineage commitment and/or tissue specificity. However, for the first time, we consider unique dimensions to the architectural organization and assembly of regulatory machinery for gene expression in nuclear microenviornments that define parameters of pluripotency. From both fundamental biological and clinical perspectives, understanding control of the abbreviated ESC cycle can provide options to coordinate control of proliferation versus differentiation. Wound healing, tissue engineering, and cell-based therapy to mitigate developmental aberrations illustrate applications that benefit from knowledge of the biology of the pluripotent cell cycle. J.

A special form of this equation is the Hutchinson-Wright equation which is a mile stone in the mathematical modeling of population dynamics and mathematical biology. Taking the delay parameter as a bifurcation parameter, Hopf bifurcation analysis is studied by following the theory in the book by Hazzard et al. By analyzing the associated characteristic polynomial, we determine necessary conditions for the linear stability and Hopf bifurcation. In addition to this analysis, the direction of bifurcation, the stability and the period of a periodic solution to this equation are evaluated at a bifurcation value by using the Poincare normal form and the center manifold theorem. Finally, the theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. "," Mathematics, Applied "

The sensing behaviour of probe 1 was studied by UV-Vis and flourescence spectroscopy. Probe 1 showed excellent high selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg2+ over commonly coexistent metal ions in neutral solution, which could be attributed to the Hg2+-triggered ring opening of the spirolactam of the rhodamine moiety and the formation of a 1:1 1-Hg2+ complex. The limit of detection (LOD) based on 3 delta(blank)/k was calculated to be 2.8 x 10(-8) M, as well as an excellent linear relationship with the concentration of Hg2+ in the range from 0.1 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-6) mol/L (R-2 = 0.98927). in addition, the effects of pH, coexisting metal ions, and the reversibility were investigated in detail.

10.1159/000339303,Novel Pathways in the Pathobiology of Human Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,"Abstract: Objectives: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a dilatation of the infrarenal aorta, typically affects males >65 years. The pathobiological mechanisms of human AAA are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to identify novel pathways involved in the development of AAAs. Methods: A custom-designed 'AAA-chip' was used to assay 43 of the differentially expressed genes identified in a previously published microarray study between AAA (n = 15) and control (n = 15) infrarenal abdominal aorta. Protein analyses were performed on selected genes. Results: Altogether 38 of the 43 genes on the 'AAA-chip' showed significantly different expression. Novel validated genes in AAA pathobiology included ADCY7, ARL4C, BLNK, FOSB, GATM, LYZ, MFGE8, PRUNE2, PTPRC, SMTN, TMODI and TPM2. These genes represent a wide range of biological functions, such as calcium signaling, development and differentiation, as well as cell adhesion not previously implicated in AAA pathobiology. Protein analyses for GATM, CD4, CXCR4, BLNK, PLEK, LYZ, FOSB, DUSP6, ITGA5 and PTPRC confirmed the mRNA findings. Conclusion: The results provide new directions for future research into AAA pathogenesis to study the role of novel genes confirmed here.

10.1016/j.ces.2012.08.027,Effect of bud scars on the mechanical properties of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls,"Abstract: To determine the effect of bud scars on the mechanical properties of the walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, freshly cultivated stationary phase cells stained with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated wheat germ agglutinin were sorted according to the number of bud scars using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The groups were daughter cells with no bud scars, and mother cells separated further by number of scars (one, two and more than two). Cells with more than three scars were very rare.

Compression testing by micromanipulation was used to determine key mechanical properties of the sorted cells. For all cells the force and fractional deformation at bursting could be determined. For 69% of cells overall but only 32% of daughter cells, a large strain mathematical model using a linear elastic constitutive equation for the wall material could be fitted to force deformation data up to cell wall failure. For these cells, the wall surface modulus, elastic modulus, initial stretch ratio and strain energy per unit volume at bursting could be estimated. For the remainder of the cells, the lack of permanent deformation on repeated compression and release (at deformations not causing bursting) suggested the cell wall material was non-linear elastic but with no observable plastic behaviour.

This is the first report to show directly that bud scars affect the global mechanical properties of yeast cells and that the important distinction with respect to scars is between daughter and mother cells. The former were smaller with more elastic walls and a higher mean initial stretch ratio. For cells for which the model could be fitted, the mean circumferential strain at bursting decreased with scarring (consistent with stiffer walls) whilst the stress increased. This may be due to the reported absence of chitin in the walls of daughter cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. "," Engineering, Chemical "
10.1002/cne.23148,Characterization of nitric oxide signaling pathways in the mouse retina,"Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous neuromodulator with physiological functions in every retinal cell type. NO is synthesized by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and often functions through its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG). This study combined NO imaging, immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology to localize NO and its downstream signaling pathways in the mouse retina. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) was localized primarily in puncta in the inner plexiform layer, in amacrine cells, and in somata in the ganglion cell layer. Endothelial NOS was in blood vessels. Light-stimulated NO production imaged with diaminofluorescein was present in somata in the inner nuclear layer and in synaptic boutons in the inner plexiform layer. The downstream target of NO, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), was in somata in the inner and outer nuclear layers and in both plexiform layers. Cyclic GMP immunocytochemistry was used functionally to localize sGC that was activated by an NO donor in amacrine, bipolar, and ganglion cells. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) Ia was found in bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and both plexiform layers, whereas PKG II was found in the outer plexiform layer, amacrine cells, and somata in the ganglion cell layer. This study shows that the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is functional and widely distributed in specific cell types in the outer and inner mouse retina. A better understanding of these signaling pathways in normal retina will provide a firm basis for targeting their roles in retinal pathology. J. Comp. Neurol. 520:42044217, 2012.

The current manuscript presents an analysis of multi-scale interactions involved in D. discoideum aggregation and non-aggregation events. The multi-scale fractal dimensions of a sequence of microscope images were used to estimate changing structure at different spatial scales. Three regions showing aggregation and three showing non-aggregation were considered. The results showed that both aggregation and non-aggregation regions were strongly multi-fractal. Analyses of the over-time relationships among nine scales of the generalized dimension, D(q), were conducted using vector autoregression and vector error-correction models. Both types of regions showed evidence that across-scale interactions serve to maintain the equilibrium of the system. Aggregation and non-aggregation regions also showed different patterns of effects of individual scales on other scales. Specifically, aggregation regions showed greater effects of both the smallest and largest scales on the smaller scale structures. The results suggest that multi-scale interactions are responsible for maintaining and altering the cellular structures during aggregation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, a number of stochastic optimal control approaches have been proposed. Probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) as powerful tools for modeling gene regulatory systems have attracted considerable attention in systems biology. In this paper, we deal with a problem of optimal intervention in a PBN with the help of the theory of discrete time Markov decision process. Specifically, we first formulate a control model for a PBN as a first passage model for discrete time Markov decision processes and then find, using a value iteration algorithm, optimal effective treatments with the minimal expected first passage time over the space of all possible treatments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, an example is also displayed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. "," Physics, Multidisciplinary "

We recommend a focus on three types of research: (i) sustained observations of the varying and evolving ocean circulation, (ii) careful analysis and interpretation of the observed climate changes for comparison with climate model projections, and (iii) the design and execution of focused field experiments to understand ocean processes that are not resolved in coupled climate models so as to be able to embed these processes realistically in the models. Within UK-sustained observations, we emphasize smart, cost-effective design of the observational network to extract maximum information from limited field resources. We encourage the incorporation of new sensors and new energy sources within the operational environment of UK-sustained observational programmes to bridge the gap that normally separates laboratory prototype from operational instrument. For interpreting the climate-change records obtained through a variety of national and international sustained observational programmes, creative and dedicated UK scientists should lead efforts to extract the meaningful signals and patterns of climate change and to interpret them so as to project future changes. For the process studies, individual scientists will need to work together in team environments to combine observational and process modelling results into effective improvements in the coupled climate models that will lead to more accurate climate predictions.

UK researchers have authored articles of high impact in all areas described here. In contrast to terrestrial geoscience, however, there have been few instrumented observations made of active processes by UK scientists. This is an area that could be developed over the next decades in the UK. Research on active processes has the potential ability to engage the wider public: Some active processes present significant geo-hazards to populations and offshore infrastructure that require monitoring and there could be commercial applications of technological developments needed for science. Some of the suggestions could involve studies in shallow coastal waters where ship costs are much reduced, addressing tighter funding constraints over the near term. The possibilities of measuring aspects of volcanic eruptions, flowing lava, turbidity currents and mass movements (landslides) are discussed. A further area of potential development is in greater collaboration between the ocean sciences. For example, it is well known in terrestrial geomorphology that biological agents are important in modulating erosion and the transport of sediments, ultimately affecting the shape of the Earth's surface in various ways. The analogous effect of biology on large-scale geomorphology in the oceans is also known but remains poorly quantified. Physical oceanographic models are becoming increasingly accurate and could be used to study further the patterns of erosion, particle transport and deposition in the oceans. Marine geological and geophysical data could in turn be useful for further verification of such models. Adapting them to conditions of past oceans could address the shorter-period movements, such as due to internal waves and tides, which have been barely addressed in palaeoceanography.

We present here a perspective that considers the opportunities that computational modelling methods may offer in addressing this challenge. Our approach takes the form of a commentary designed to inform responses to future calls for research in predictive toxicology. It is considered essential that computational model-building activities be at the centre of the initiative, driving an iterative process of development, testing and refinement. It is critical that the models provide mechanistic understanding and quantitative predictions. The aim would be to predict effects in humans: in order to help define a challenging but yet feasible initial goal the focus would be on liver mitochondrial toxicity. This will inevitably present many challenges that naturally lead to a modular approach, in which the overall problem is broken down into smaller, more self-contained sub-problems that will subsequently need to be connected and aligned to develop an overall understanding. The project would investigate multiple modelling approaches in order to encourage links between the various disciplines that hitherto have often operated in isolation. The project should build upon current activities in the wider scientific community, to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure that investment is maximised. Strong leadership will be required to ensure alignment around a set of common goals that would be derived using a problem-statement driven approach. Finally, although the focus here is on toxicology, there is a clear link to the wider challenges in systems medicine and improving human health. ", Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Toxicology

Fibrillar collagen in the vascular wall plays a central role in tissue adaptation owing to its relatively short lifetime. Pathological alterations of collagen turnover may fail to result in homeostasis and could be responsible for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth at later stages of the disease. For this reason our previously reported multiscale constitutive framework (Martufi, G. & Gasser, T. C. 2011 J. Biomech. 44, 2544-2550 (doi:10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.07.015)) has been enriched by a collagen turnover model. Specifically, the framework's collagen fibril level allowed a sound integration of vascular wall biology, and the impact of collagen turnover on the macroscopic properties of AAAs was studied. To this end, model parameters were taken from the literature and/or estimated from clinical follow-up data of AAAs (on average 50.7 mm-large). Likewise, the in vivo stretch of the AAA wall was set, such that 10 per cent of collagen fibres were engaged. Results showed that the stretch spectrum, at which collagen fibrils are deposed, is the most influential parameter, i.e. it determines whether the vascular geometry grows, shrinks or remains stable over time. Most importantly, collagen turnover also had a remarkable impact on the macroscopic stress field. It avoided high stress gradients across the vessel wall, thus predicted a physiologically reasonable stress field. Although the constitutive model could be successfully calibrated to match the growth of small AAAs, a rigorous validation against experimental data is crucial to further explore the model's descriptive and predictive capabilities.

We applied an emergent, high-speed, volumetric fluid imaging technique (tomographic particle image velocimetry) to examine segments of the wake of desert locusts, capturing fully three-dimensional instantaneous flow fields. We used those flow fields to characterize the aerodynamic footprint in unprecedented detail and revealed previously unseen wake elements that would have gone undetected by two-dimensional or stereo-imaging technology. Vortex iso-surface topographies show the spatio-temporal signature of aerodynamic force generation manifest in the wake of locusts, and expose the extent to which animal wakes can deform, potentially leading to unreliable calculations of lift and thrust when using conventional diagnostic methods. We discuss implications for experimental design and analysis as volumetric flow imaging becomes more widespread. ", Multidisciplinary Sciences

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N > 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed. ", Multidisciplinary Sciences

Correspondingly, this concept provides a characterization of the robustness and functional centrality for each enzyme involved in a given metabolic network.

10.1098/rspb.2012.1664,Unprecedented ichneumonid parasitoid wasp diversity in tropical forests,"Abstract: The megadiverse parasitoid wasp family Ichneumonidae (Hymenoptera) is classically considered an exception to the extensively studied latitudinal diversity gradient: the majority of ichneumonid species are described from temperate regions. The gradient has been hypothesized to be dependent on the biology of the wasps, but recently questions of sampling and description biases have been raised. Here, we show with primary data that the species richness of Ichneumonidae is markedly underestimated in tropical areas and that latitudinal diversity patterns in the family remain uncharacterized. We discovered a startling 177 likely undescribed orthocentrine species with relatively low sampling effort in the forests of Central America and Amazonian Ecuador, over three times the previously known orthocentrine diversity in the world's tropics. Species accumulation curves reveal that we are just beginning to unveil the true extent of tropical orthocentrine diversity. We also found evidence for cryptic species; our DNA analysis revealed additional species not easily distinguishable using morphological characteristics. The difficulty in establishing species richness patterns of Ichneumonidae probably follows from the relative lack of taxonomic expertise and the low density of ichneumonid species throughout the landscape.

10.1098/rsfs.2012.0033,From behavioural analyses to models of collective motion in fish schools,"Abstract: Fish schooling is a phenomenon of long-lasting interest in ethology and ecology, widely spread across taxa and ecological contexts, and has attracted much interest from statistical physics and theoretical biology as a case of self-organized behaviour. One topic of intense interest is the search of specific behavioural mechanisms at stake at the individual level and from which the school properties emerges. This is fundamental for understanding how selective pressure acting at the individual level promotes adaptive properties of schools and in trying to disambiguate functional properties from non-adaptive epiphenomena. Decades of studies on collective motion by means of individual-based modelling have allowed a qualitative understanding of the self-organization processes leading to collective properties at school level, and provided an insight into the behavioural mechanisms that result in coordinated motion. Here, we emphasize a set of paradigmatic modelling assumptions whose validity remains unclear, both from a behavioural point of view and in terms of quantitative agreement between model outcome and empirical data. We advocate for a specific and biologically oriented re-examination of these assumptions through experimental-based behavioural analysis and modelling. ", Biophysics 
10.1098/rsfs.2012.0034,Pattern-formation mechanisms in motility mutants of Myxococcus xanthus,"Abstract: Formation of spatial patterns of cells is a recurring theme in biology and often depends on regulated cell motility. Motility of the rod-shaped cells of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus depends on two motility machineries, type IV pili (giving rise to S-motility) and the gliding motility apparatus (giving rise to A-motility). Cell motility is regulated by occasional reversals. Moving M. xanthus cells can organize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies, depending on their nutritional status. To ultimately understand these two pattern-formation processes and the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as the cell reversal machinery, we analyse spatial self-organization in three M. xanthus strains: (i) a mutant that moves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, (ii) a unidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and (iii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, occasionally reverses its direction of movement. The mutant moving by means of the A-engine illustrates that collective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding bacteria owing to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need of invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant reveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are present, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the study of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces the formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while it results in vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are consistent with what is known from self-propelled rod models, which strongly suggests that the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions is the pattern-formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. On the other hand, we learn that when cells occasionally reverse their moving direction, as observed in the wild-type, cells form small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like structure at high enough densities. These results have been obtained from a careful analysis of the cluster statistics of ensembles of cells, and analysed in the light of a coagulation Smoluchowski equation with fragmentation.

Information about these interactions can improve our understanding of diseases and provide the basis to revolutionize therapeutic treatments. However, current experimental techniques for large-scale detection of protein-protein interactions are biased against membrane proteins, it is necessary to develop novel tools to deal with this kind of bio-network. To realize this, we construct membrane protein interaction network based on gene regulatory network model. Three model forms, basic form, non-dimensionalization form, and more complex form, are proposed to understand the dynamic and collective control of developmental process and the characters of membrane protein interaction network, including small-world network, scale free distributing and robustness, and its significance for biology. Four simulation examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and flexibility of the GRN model method for the study of membrane protein interaction network. The results show that the proposed approach holds a high potential to become a useful tool in prediction of membrane protein interactions. Moreover, it has biological significance and value for biology and pharmacology. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. "," Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence "
10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.08.022,"Fucanomics and galactanomics: Current status in drug discovery, mechanisms of action and role of the well-defined structures","Abstract: Background: With the recent advent of glycomics, many medically relevant glycans have been discovered. Sulfated fucans (SFs) and sulfated galactans (SGs) are one of these classes of glycans with increasing interest to both glycomics and medicine. Besides having very unique structures, some of these molecules exhibit a broad range of pharmacological actions. In certain cases, high levels of effectiveness may be reached when the proper structural requirements are found.

Scope of review: Here, we cover the fundamental biochemical mechanisms of some of these medicinal properties. We particularly focus on the beneficial activities of SFs and SGs in inflammation, hemostasis, vascular biology, and cancer.

Major conclusions: In these clinical systems. intermolecular complexes directly driven by electrostatic interactions of SFs and SGs with P- and L-selectins, chemokines, antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, thrombin, factor Xa, bFGF, and VEGF, overall govern the resultant therapeutic effects. In spite of that, the structural features of SFs and SGs have shown to be essential determinants for formation and stability of those molecular complexes, which consequently account to the differential levels of the biomedical responses.

General significance: Accurate structure-function relationships have mostly been achieved when SFs and SGs of well-defined structures are used for study. Therefore, these types of glycans have become of great usefulness to identify the chemical requirements needed to achieve satisfactory clinical responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.09.011,The abasic site lesions in the human telomeric sequence d[TA(G(3)T(2)A)(3)G(3)]: A thermodynamic point of view,"Abstract: Background: The abasic sites represent one of the most frequent lesions of DNA and most of the events able to generate such modifications involve guanine bases. G-rich sequences are able to form quadruplex structures that have been proved to be involved in several important biological processes.

Methods: In this paper, we report investigations, based on calorimetric, UV, CD and electrophoretic techniques, on 12 oligodeoxynucleotides analogues of the quadruplex forming human telomere sequence d[TA(G(3)T(2)A)(3)G(3)], in which each guanine has been replaced, one at a time, by an abasic site mimic.

Results: Although all data show that the modified sequences preserve their ability to form quadruplex structures, the thermodynamic parameters clearly indicate that the presence of an abasic site decreases their thermal stability compared to the parent unmodified sequence, particularly if the replacement concerns one of the guanosines involved in the formation of the central G-tetrad.

Conclusions: The collected data indicate that the effects of the presence of abasic site lesions in telomeric quadruplex structures are site-specific. The most dramatic consequences come out when this lesion involves a guanosine in the centre of a G-run.

General significance: Abasic sites, by facilitating the G-quadruplex disruption, could favour the formation of the telomerase primer. Furthermore they could have implications in the pharmacological approach targeting telomere. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. ", Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics

With rapid alterations of ecosystems occurring across the globe, organisms are being faced with sensory challenges that result in behavioural changes and disruptions with potential population-level consequences. Through a consideration of sensory ecology, it is possible to identify the underlying causes of disturbances at the individual level and use this information to develop better-informed, highly targeted, and more effective management strategies. Indeed, sensory-based approaches have already been successful in response to a variety of conservation issues. This article provides a general discussion of how a consideration of sensory ecology can benefit conservation biology and proceeds to describe three areas of rapid growth and potential for expansion: (1) mitigation of anthropogenic noise disturbance; (2) prevention and amelioration of ecological and other evolutionary traps; (3) targeted population control with special attention to aquatic invasive species.

Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations. The approaches presented here illustrate feasible ways to incorporate the ecosystem functioning dimension into conservation through the use of satellite-derived information.

The focus in process improvement is often on understanding and manipulating the regulation of metabolism. Nonetheless, one encounters situations where organisms are remarkably resilient to further optimization or their properties become unstable. Therefore it is important to understand the origin of these apparent limitations to find whether and how they can be improved. We argue that by considering fitness effects of regulation, a more generic explanation for certain behaviour can be obtained. In this view, apparent process limitations arise from trade-offs that cells faced as they evolved to improve fitness. A deeper understanding of such trade-offs using a systems biology approach can ultimately enhance performance of cell factories. ", Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

To circumvent these problems, a P-alsSD-controlled auto-inducible 2-ketoisovalerate biosynthetic pathway and a P-spac-controlled IPTG-inducible Ehrlich pathway were constructed in Bacillus subtilis to modulate gene expression. Based on the precise gene expression characteristics of the two inducible pathways, the optimal IPTG induction time point and dose for 2-methyl-1-propanol biosynthesis were determined as 9.5 h and 300 mu M, respectively.

The historical reduction in abundance and geographic distribution of the American plains bison (Bison bison bison) and their recovery over the last 125 years is well documented. However, introgression from domestic cattle (Bos taurus) into the few remaining bison populations that existed in the late 1800s has now been identified in many modern bison herds. We examined the phenotypic effect of this ancestry by comparing weight and height of bison with cattle or bison mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Santa Catalina Island, California (U.S.A.), a nutritionally stressful environment for bison, and of a group of age-matched feedlot bison males in Montana, a nutritionally rich environment. The environmental and nutritional differences between these 2 bison populations were very different and demonstrated the phenotypic effect of domestic cattle mtDNA in bison over a broad range of conditions. For example, the average weight of feedlot males that were 2 years of age was 2.54 times greater than that of males from Santa Catalina Island. In both environments, bison with cattle mtDNA had lower weight compared with bison with bison mtDNA, and on Santa Catalina Island, the height of bison with cattle mtDNA was lower than the height of bison with bison mtDNA. These data support the hypothesis that body size is smaller and height is lower in bison with domestic cattle mtDNA and that genomic integrity is important for the conservation of the American plains bison.

To identify virulence-associated genes to improve the biocontrol efficacy of M. acridum, it is necessary to understand the genes expressed by M. acridum during its infection of the insect host cuticle. In this study, we performed a large scale gene expression analysis of M. acridum during locust cuticle infection. We report the identification of 4,739 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 80 % have not been previously identified. Analysis of the ESTs provided evidence that M. acridum may employ several different adaptation strategies to infect locust cuticle, such as metabolism reprogramming, protein secretion, endocytosis, cell-cycle-regulated morphogenesis and effector-dependent suppression of host immune responses. By searching against the pathogen-host interaction database, several genes associated with different adaptation processes were found to potentially encode important virulence genes. Gene expression pattern analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that M. acridum differentially regulates subsets of genes in response to different infection niches between the host cuticle and hemolymph.

This issue of Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology is focused on primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Like every disorder, PID has its own specific history, starting with the discovery of agammaglobulinemia in 1952 and still expanding at a rapid pace, covering, at the time of this publication, more than 180 genetically determined disorders. However, as this report attempts to demonstrate, the history of PID is intertwined with the development of modern medicine and is the direct result of the innovative thinking of physician scientists who introduced new concepts in pathology, microbiology, biochemistry, and immunology, based on carefully designed experiments. As a consequence of the novel ideas put forth in the late 19th century, progress in public health, the discovery of antimicrobials, and the utilization of biologic products led to the recognition of genetically determined defects of Immunity and the design of effective treatment strategies.

Recent findings

The discovery of the structure of DNA, its replication, and the mapping of the human genome has transformed the field of PID into a predictable science of cutting edge therapies and diagnostic concepts.

However, data on the early stages of developing stereotypies are currently scarce. We compared the development of stereotypic route-tracing and somersaulting in hand-reared and wild-caught starlings placed in individual cages for the first time. We found that wild-caught birds were less active but showed more escape motivation and more evidence of route-tracing behavior. Furthermore, somersaulting was only observed in wild-caught birds. Development of somersaulting was predicted by subtle differences in behavior during the first few days in cages and developed in individuals with low levels of route-tracing behavior. Our data suggest a role for escape motivation in the development of starling stereotypies and additionally that route-tracing and somersaulting may represent alternative outlets for thwarted escape. In contrast to observations from mammals, our results show that stereotypies are more common in wild-caught starlings. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,Inc.

An intriguing aspect is the morphological and ecological similarity between H. pseudoalbidus and the native saprotroph Hymenoscyphus albidus. We revisited four localities where H. albidus apothecia were collected from 1989 to 2005 and established the current relationship of the species in these Danish ash stands based on microsatellites and differences in ITS sequences (used as CAPs marker). Scottish collections from 2010 supported the hypothesis that Danish herbarium samples prior to 2005 are identical to H. albidus still found in Scotland. The markers further revealed that herbarium samples from 1989 to 1994 were all H. albidus, while the latest collection (2005) was H. pseudoalbidus, which coincides with the first Danish symptom observations. Collections from 2010 were purely H. pseudoalbidus. We suggest that expanding H. pseudoalbidus excludes H. albidus from its niche resulting in H. albidus becoming a rare species in Denmark, which is perhaps already locally extinct.

Significant correlation (Spearman rho = 1.0; p < 0.001) between the number of genets and the number of areas delimited by pseudosclerotial plates (PSPs) on the decayed portions of stem sections suggests PSPs are interaction zone lines between different individuals of K. deusta occupying adjacent decay columns.

Beauv.) poses a serious threat to crop production in the southern United States. A thorough knowledge of the biology of barnyardgrass is fundamental for designing effective resistance-management programmes. In the present study, seed production of barnyardgrass in response to time of emergence was investigated in cotton and rice, respectively, in Fayetteville and Rohwer, Arkansas, over a 2-year period (2008-09). Barnyardgrass seed production was greater when seedlings emerged with the crop, but some seed production was observed even if seedlings emerged several weeks after crop emergence. Moreover, barnyardgrass seed production was highly variable across environments. When emerging with the crop (0 weeks after crop emergence (WAE)), barnyardgrass produced c. 35500 and 16500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 39000 and 2900 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Seed production was observed when seedlings emerged up to 5 WAE (2008) or 7 WAE (2009) in cotton and up to 5 WAE (2008, 2009) in rice; corresponding seed production was c. 2500 and 1500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 14700 and 110 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The results suggest that cultural approaches that delay the emergence of barnyardgrass or approaches that make the associated crop more competitive will be useful in integrated management programmes. In the context of herbicide resistance management, it may be valuable to prevent seed return to the seedbank, irrespective of cohorts.

However, the complexity of the biology probed and the incomplete validation of the reagents used make it difficult to interpret the results of genome-wide siRNA screens. To address this challenge and maximize the return on the efforts required for validating genomic screen hits, the screening strategy must be designed to increase the robustness of the primary screening hits and include assays that inform on the mechanism of action of the knocked-down transcripts. Here, we describe the implementation of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify genes that sensitize the effect of poly-(ADP ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor on cell survival. In the strategy we designed for the primary screen, two biological activities, apoptosis and cell viability, were measured simultaneously at different time points in the presence and absence of a PARP inhibitor (PARPi). The multiplexed assay allowed us to identify PARPi sensitizers induced by both caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms. The multiplexed screening strategy yielded robust primary hits with significant enrichment for DNA repair genes, which were further validated using relevant high-content imaging assays and confirmation of transcript knockdown by real-time PCR (rtPCR).

The STARD1 (STARD1 and STARD3) and STARD4 subfamilies (STARD4-6) have an internal cavity large enough to accommodate sterols. To provide a deeper understanding on the structural biology of this domain, the binding of sterols to STARD5, a member of the STARD4 subfamily, was monitored. The SAR by NMR [H-1-N-15 heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC)] approach, complemented by circular dichroism (CD) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), was used. Titration of STARD5 with cholic (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), leads to drastic perturbation of the H-1-N-15 HSQC spectra and the identification of the residues in contact with those ligands. The most perturbed residues in presence of ligands are lining the internal cavity of the protein. Ka values of 1.8.10(-4) M-1 and 6.3.10(4)M(-1) were measured for CA and CDCA, respectively.

A total of 19,816 individuals were collected, of which 5341 were measured, with an estimated longevity of 2.02 (UB) and 2.15 (CA) years for females and 1.80 (UB) and 1.96 (CA) years for males. There was a statistically significant bias in sex ratio toward females (Chi-square test, p<0.05) in both regions. The CCorrA resulted in a canonical correlation coefficient of 0.32 (p<0.00001). Both temperature and grain size composition of the sediment showed high correlation mainly with the presence of reproductive females, followed spermatophore-bearing males and recruits. In general, these demographic classes were most common in conditions of low temperature and fine sediments. These findings, as well as other studies carried out in colder regions with the same species, are consistent with the classical paradigm of lower longevity at lower latitudes. However, our results also suggest that this species maintained abiotic preference as populations located in cold temperate regions, mainly with temperature, indicating a different behavior from other shrimp species explored by fishery in the same region.

10.1128/JVI.00973-12,Authentic In Vitro Replication of Two Tombusviruses in Isolated Mitochondrial and Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes,"Abstract: Replication of plus-stranded RNA viruses takes place on membranous structures derived from various organelles in infected cells. Previous works with Tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus (TBSV) revealed the recruitment of either peroxisomal or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes for replication. In case of Carnation Italian ringspot tombusvirus (CIRV), the mitochondrial membranes supported CIRV replication. In this study, we developed ER and mitochondrion-based in vitro tombusvirus replication assays. Using purified recombinant TBSV and CIRV replication proteins, we showed that TBSV could use the purified yeast ER and mitochondrial preparations for complete viral RNA replication, while CIRV preferentially replicated in the mitochondrial membranes. The viral RNA became partly RNase resistant after similar to 40 to 60 min of incubation in the purified ER and mitochondrial preparations, suggesting that assembly of TBSV and CIRV replicases could take place in the purified ER and mitochondrial membranes in vitro. Using chimeric and heterologous combinations of replication proteins, we showed that multiple domains within the replication proteins are involved in determining the efficiency of tombusvirus replication in the two subcellular membranes. Altogether, we demonstrated that TBSV is less limited while CIRV is more restricted in utilizing various intracellular membranes for replication. Overall, the current work provides evidence that tombusvirus replication could occur in vitro in isolated subcellular membranes, suggesting that tombusviruses have the ability to utilize alternative organellar membranes during infection that could increase the chance of mixed virus replication and rapid evolution during coinfection.

In order to keep the manufacturing process of the sensor simple, arrays of single split-ring-resonators are used. Two types of resonators, square and circular, are designed to cover different frequency ranges. An unknown material is then added as an overlayer to the metamaterial in order to explore the performance of the entire system in terms of sensing phenomenon. The changes in the transmission resonances are monitored upon variation of the thickness, the dielectric constant, and the coverage (distribution of the unknown material within each unit cell) of the overlayer. The results show good sensitivity of the sensors suggesting they can be used for a myriad of terahertz sensing applications in biology and chemistry.

Here, a comparative study between these proteomes was performed to find potential proteins and functions associated with human sperm maturation. Seven reproductive proteomes associated with human sperm physiology were integrated. Gene ontology analysis were performed using DAVID and Panther tools to determine enriched functions. Total of 270 proteins overlapped between epididymal, prostatic milieu and sperm proteome were thought to be candidate proteins involved in sperm maturation, and they showed enriched functions of proteasomal protein catabolic process and protein folding. 34 epididymal milieu proteins and 274 prostatic milieu proteins were contributed to the composition of seminal fluids proteome. Literatures have confirmed the involvements in sperm maturation of many of these proteins The spatial expressions of 24 epididymal milieu proteins involved in chaperone and antioxidant activity were authenticated by real-time RT-PCR. These proteins may serve as candidate molecules for future studies of sperm maturation and male infertility. ", Biochemistry & Molecular Biology

The objective of this study was to investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LPL gene and to determine their associations between these polymorphisms and growth traits in Xiangxi cattle breed. In this study, six novel SNPs (C355157T, T355169C, T355186G, A355210G, T355348A and T355420C) and one reported SNP (A355427T, has been recorded in dbSNP, ID rs110590698) were detected using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing method. Genotyping and genetic diversity analysis were performed in 240 Xiangxi cattle on the basis of sequence alignment, which indicated that five SNPs (C355157T, 355186G, T355348A, T355420C, A355427T) were in abundant genetic diversity, and the other two SNPs (T355169C and TA355210G) were in low genetic diversity. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that 18 different haplotypes were identified in these animals. Moreover, the results of the association between LPL gene polymorphisms and growth traits indicated that the individuals with H1H1 haplotype combination had higher BW and HG than those with other haplotype combinations (P < 0.05). The animals with CC genotype maintain higher mean values for BW than those with the CT and TT genotypes (P < 0.05) at T355420C locus. The animals with the AA genotype have lower mean values for WH, BL, HG and BW than those with the AT and TT genotypes at A355427T locus (P < 0.05). The results suggested that the SNPs of the LPL gene might be useful genetic markers for growth traits in the bovine reproduction and breeding. ", Biochemistry & Molecular Biology

In this study, we reported the cloning of an IKK homologue cDNA (designated as AmphiIKK) from amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri. The full-length cDNA consists of 3,087 bp with an ORF that encoded a predicted protein of 777 amino acid residues. The putative amphioxus IKK protein possesses the characteristic organization of the mammalian IKK proteins, which consists of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a leucine zipper motif and a putative helix-loop-helix motif. And the deduced amino acid of AmphiIKK shared 43.8-64.0 % similarity and 23.6-43.3 % identified with the IKKs from other species. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that AmphiIKK was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and we also discovered that the expression of AmphiIKK was affected after lipopolysaccharides stimulation. Our findings help to highlight a potential important regulatory pathway in the innate immune response in the amphioxus and the evolution of the IKK family. ", Biochemistry & Molecular Biology

The results were compared to 235 normal controls. The results indicated significant differences in frequency and genotype association between different types of cancers. Breast carcinoma patients most prominently showed excess of homozygous arg genotype as compared to controls with an Odd ratio (OR) of 19.44, 95 %CI: 6.6-78.3, P < 0.0001. Less prominently cervical cancer showed genotype effect of 2.4 OR, 95 %CI: 1.12-5.33, P = 0.015, while esophageal cancer had an OR of 0.57, 95 %CI: 0.23-1.42, P = 0.1. In Burkitt's lymphoma, however, in contrast the homozygous arg accounted for only 6.9 %, (OR 0.18, 95 %CI: 0.02-0.89, P = 0.018).

We examine the evolutionary relationships within the subfamily Halictinae (""sweat bees"") to investigate the origins of social behaviour within the tribe Halictini. We present a new phylogeny of the subfamily Halictinae based on three nuclear genes (elongation factor-1 alpha, wingless, and long-wavelength rhodopsin) and one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c oxidase 1) sequenced for 206 halictine bees. We use model-based character reconstruction to infer the probability of a shared eusocial ancestor for the genera Halictus and Lasioglossum, the two genera of Halictini which display eusociality. Our results suggest a high probability for a single origin of eusociality for these two genera, contradicting earlier views of separate origins within each taxon. Fossil-calibrated divergence estimates place this ancestor at approximately 35 million years ago, about 14 million years earlier than previous estimates of eusocial origins in the halictid bees.

10.1111/j.1364-3703.2012.00816.x,Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi: some like it knot,"Abstract: Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi is the causal agent of olive (Olea europaea) knot disease and an unorthodox member of the P.?syringae complex, causing aerial tumours instead of the foliar necroses and cankers characteristic of most members of this complex. Olive knot is present wherever olive is grown; although losses are difficult to assess, it is assumed that olive knot is one of the most important diseases of the olive crop. The last century witnessed a large number of scientific articles describing the biology, epidemiology and control of this pathogen. However, most P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi strains are highly recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which has effectively prevented the pathogen from benefitting from the scientific progress in molecular biology that has elevated the foliar pathogens of the P.?syringae complex to supermodels. A number of studies in recent years have made significant advances in the biology, ecology and genetics of P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi, paving the way for the molecular dissection of its interaction with other nonpathogenic bacteria and their woody hosts. The selection of a genetically pliable model strain was soon followed by the development of rapid methods for virulence assessment with micropropagated olive plants and the analysis of cellular interactions with the plant host. The generation of a draft genome of strain NCPPB 3335 and the closed sequence of its three native plasmids has allowed for functional and comparative genomic analyses for the identification of its pathogenicity gene complement. This includes 34 putative type III effector genes and genomic regions, shared with other pathogens of woody hosts, which encode metabolic pathways associated with the degradation of lignin-derived compounds. Now, the time is right to explore the molecular basis of the P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoiolive interaction and to obtain insights into why some pathovars like it necrotic and why some like it knot. Synonyms Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi. Taxonomy Kingdom Bacteria; Phylum Proteobacteria; Class Gammaproteobacteria; Family Pseudomonadaceae; Genus Pseudomonas; included in genomospecies 2 together with at least P.?amygdali, P.?ficuserectae, P.?meliae and 16 other pathovars from the P.?syringae complex (aesculi, ciccaronei, dendropanacis, eriobotryae, glycinea, hibisci, mellea, mori, myricae, phaseolicola, photiniae, sesami, tabaci, ulmi and certain strains of lachrymans and morsprunorum); when a formal proposal is made for the unification of these bacteria, the species name P.?amygdali would take priority over P.?savastanoi. Microbiological properties Gram-negative rods, 0.40.8?x?1.03.0?mu m, aerobic. Motile by one to four polar flagella, rather slow growing, optimal temperatures for growth of 2530?degrees C; oxidase negative, arginine dihydrolase negative; elicits the hypersensitive response on tobacco; most isolates are fluorescent and levan negative, although some isolates are nonfluorescent and levan positive. Host range P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi causes tumours in cultivated and wild olive and ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Although strains from olive have been reported to infect oleander (Nerium oleander), this is generally not the case; however, strains of P.?savastanoi pv. nerii can infect olive. Pathovars fraxini and nerii are differentiated from pathovar savastanoi mostly in their host range, and were not formally recognized until 1996. Literature before about 1996 generally names strains of the three pathovars as P.?syringae ssp. savastanoi or P.?savastanoi ssp.

savastanoi, contributing to confusion on the host range and biological properties. Disease symptoms Symptoms of infected trees include hyperplastic growths (tumorous galls or knots) on the stems and branches of the host plant and, occasionally, on leaves and fruits. Epidemiology The pathogen can survive and multiply on aerial plant surfaces, as well as in knots, from where it can be dispersed by rain, wind, insects and human activities, entering the plant through wounds. Populations are very unevenly distributed in the plant, and suffer drastic fluctuations throughout the year, with maximum numbers of bacteria occurring during rainy and warm months. Populations of P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi are normally associated with nonpathogenic bacteria, both epiphytically and endophytically, and have been demonstrated to form mutualistic consortia with Erwinia toletana and Pantoea agglomerans, which could result in increased bacterial populations and disease symptoms. Disease control Based on preventive measures, mostly sanitary and cultural practices. Integrated control programmes benefit from regular applications of copper formulations, which should be maintained for at least a few years for maximum benefit. Olive cultivars vary in their susceptibility to olive knot, but there are no known cultivars with full resistance to the pathogen.

Several components of body composition variability (fat/lean ratio, fat distribution, lean mass composition and metabolism, and adipose tissue biology) are increasingly linked with cardiometabolic risk and vary substantially across ethnic groups. Constituents of lean mass are proposed to contribute to metabolic capacity, a generic trait favouring the maintenance of homeostasis. Adiposity is proposed to contribute to metabolic load, which at higher levels challenges metabolic homeostasis, elevating cardiometabolic risk. Ethnic differences in body composition, representing different load-capacity ratios, may therefore contribute to ethnic variability in cardiometabolic risk. Ecological and evolutionary factors potentially contributing to ethnic variability in body composition are explored. In contemporary populations, clinicians encounter an increasing range of ethnicity, along with many individuals of mixed-ethnic ancestry. Increasing understanding of the contribution of body composition to cardiometabolic risk may reduce the need to treat ethnic groups as qualitatively different. A conceptual model is proposed, treating insulin sensitivity and stroke risk as composite functions of body composition variables. Operationalizing this model may potentially improve the ability to assess cardiovascular risk across the full ethnicity spectrum, and to predict cardiometabolic consequences of excess weight gain.

Experiments with different strengths of Hoaglands solution showed that all three pathogens survived at a broad range of EC levels for at least 3 days and were stimulated to grow and sporulate at ECs > 1.89 dS m-1. Recovery of initial populations after a 14-day exposure was over 20% for P. alni subsp. alni and P. kernoviae, and 61.3% and 130% for zoospores and sporangia of P. ramorum, respectively. Zoospore survival of these pathogens at ECs < 0.41 dS m-1 was poor, barely beyond 3 days in pure water; only 0.3% (P. alni), 2.9% (P. kernoviae) and 15.1% (P. ramorum) of the initial population survived after 14 days at EC = 0.21 dS m-1. The variation in rates of survival at different EC levels suggests that these pathogens survive better in cropping systems than in irrigation water. Containment of run-off and reduction in EC levels may therefore be non-chemical control options to reduce the risk of pathogen spread through natural waterways and irrigation systems.

Numerous palynological studies have described the morphology of pollen from Cactaceae and from other families of plants. There have, however, been few studies of the variation of pollen traits, especially variation of pollen size. Here, we describe the morphology of pollen grains from Pachycereus weberi, paying particular attention to variation of the diameter of the grains. We found that pollen grains from P. weberi are spheroidal, isopolar, and tricolpate, with microperforate and spinulate tectum and visible perine. Pollen diameter is highly variable. Our results show that pollen size must be used carefully as a taxonomic character. Further, we discuss the importance of sample size in descriptive studies of pollen and diverse meiotic abnormalities that may be implied by the high variation of pollen grain size for P. weberi.

The links between genetics, developmental mechanics and evolution led to a better understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. An analysis of evolutionary concepts such as homology, homeoses, constraints, novelties, modularity, and selection is given through the recurring example of the variations identified in the modular repartition of the cervical vertebrae in extant and fossil penguins. The inclusion of this study about penguins in the evolutionary system also involves a reflection on the current state and the future of evo-devo. Three principles of assessment and method, applicable to many natural and conceptual scales, are introduced to define a ""survival strategy"" for evo-devo.

10.1007/s12064-012-0162-3,Measurement of mRNA abundance using RNA-seq data: RPKM measure is inconsistent among samples,"Abstract: Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure. ", Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology

We propose that use of the developing embryonic femur as a model to further understand skeletogenesis, and the effects of key differentiation agents, will aid our understanding of the developing bone niche and inform bone reparation. We have used a three-dimensional organotypic culture system of embryonic chick femora to investigate the effects of two key skeletal differentiation agents, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), on bone and cartilage development, using a combination of microcomputed tomography and histological analysis to assess tissue formation and structure, and cellular behavior.

Stimulation of embryonic day 11 (E11) organotypic femur cultures with PTH and PTHrP initiated osteogenesis. Bone formation was enhanced, with increased collagen I and STRO-1 expression, and cartilage was reduced, with decreased chondrocyte proliferation, collagen II expression, and glycosaminoglycan levels.

This study demonstrates the successful use of organotypic chick femur cultures as a model for bone development, evidenced by the ability of exogenous bioactive molecules to differentially modulate bone and cartilage formation. The organotypic model outlined provides a tool for analyzing key temporal stages of bone and cartilage development, providing a paradigm for translation of bone development to improve scaffolds and skeletal stem cell treatments for skeletal regenerative medicine.

Field-collected coral samples were collected from Nanwan Bay in southern Taiwan. Cultured corals were collected from the cultivating tank at National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium. A total of 1,526 and 1,138 culturable, heterotrophic bacteria were isolated from wild and cultured corals, respectively; seawater requirement and antimicrobial activity were then assessed. There is no significant difference between the ratio of seawater-requiring bacteria on the wild and cultured corals.

Arbuscules, mycelia and structures resembling intrathallic spores or vesicles were developed in the internal parenchymatic cells. The pattern of AM colonization in P. rupestre was very similar to the Paris-type.

Optimization of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles of biotherapeutics is crucial for clinical, as well as commercial, success of these drugs. This review focuses on the common questions and challenges in ADME optimization of biotherapeutics for inflammatory conditions. For these immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive biotherapeutics, special consideration should be given to the assessment of the interdependency of ADME profiles, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships, and immunogenicity profiles across various preclinical species and humans, including the interdependencies both in biology and in assay readouts. The context of usage, such as dosing regimens, extent of disease, concomitant medications, and drug product characteristics may have a direct or indirect (via modulation of immunogenicity) impact on ADME profiles of biotherapeutics. Along these lines, emerging topics include assessments of preexisting reactivity to a biotherapeutic agent, impact of immunogenicity on tissue exposure, and analysis of penetration to normal versus inflamed tissues. Because of the above complexities and interdependences, it is essential to interpret PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody results in an integrated manner. In addition, because of the competitive landscape in autoimmune and inflammatory markets, many pioneering ADME-centric protein engineering and subsequent in vivo testing (such as optimization of novel modalities to extend serum and tissue exposures and to improve bioavailability) are being conducted with biotherapeutics in this therapeutic area. However, the ultimate challenge is demonstration of the clinical relevance (or lack thereof) of modified ADME and immunogenicity profiles. ", Pharmacology & Pharmacy 
10.1134/S000368381107009X,Application of cell technologies for production of plant-derived bioactive substances of plant origin,"Abstract: Bioactive substances (BAS) of plant origin are known to play a very important role in modern medicine. Their use, however, is often limited by availability of plant resources and may jeopardize rare species of medicinal plants. Plant cell cultures can serve as a renewable source of valuable secondary metabolites. To the date, however, only few examples of their commercial use are known. The main reasons for such a situation are the insufficient production of secondary metabolites and high cultivation costs. It is possible to increase the performance of plant cell cultures by one or two orders of magnitude using traditional methods, such as selection of highly productive strains, optimization of the medium composition, elicitation, and addition of precursors of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The progress in molecular biology methods brought about the advent of new means for increasing of the productivity of cell cultures based on the methods of metabolic engineering. Thus, overexpression of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the synthesis of the target product or, by contrast, repression of these genes significantly influences the cell biosynthetic capacity in vitro. Nevertheless, the attempts of the production of many secondary metabolites in plant cell culture were unsuccessful so far, probably due to the peculiarities of the cell culture as an artificial population of plant somatic cells. The use of plant organ culture or transformed roots (hairy root) could turn to be a considerably more efficient solution for this problem. The production of plant-derived secondary metabolites in yeast or bacteria transformed with plant genes is being studied currently. Although the attempts to use metabolic engineering methods were not particularly successful so far, new insights in biochemistry and physiology of secondary metabolism, particularly in regulation and compartmentation of secondary metabolite synthesis as well as mechanisms of their transport and storage make these approaches promising.

10.1016/j.bbcan.2012.05.001,Molecular and cellular biology of neuroendocrine lung tumors: Evidence for separate biological entities,"Abstract: Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are traditionally described as comprising a spectrum of neoplasms, ranging from low grade typical carcinoids (TCs) via the intermediate grade atypical carcinoids (ACs) to the highly malignant small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs). Recent data, however, suggests that two categories can be distinguished on basis of molecular and clinical data, i.e. the high grade neuroendocrine (NE) carcinomas and the carcinoid tumors.

Bronchial carcinoids and SCLCs may originate from the same pulmonary NE precursor cells, but a precursor lesion has only been observed in association with carcinoids, termed diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. The occurrence of mixed tumors exclusively comprising high grade NE carcinomas also supports a different carcinogenesis for these two groups. Histopathologically, high grade NE lung tumors are characterized by high mitotic and proliferative indices, while carcinoids are defined by maximally 10 mitoses per 2 mm(2) (10 high-power fields) and rarely have Ki67-proliferative indices over 10%. High grade NE carcinomas are chemosensitive tumors, although they usually relapse. Surgery is often not an option due to extensive disease at presentation and early metastasis, especially in SCLC. Conversely, carcinoids are often insensitive to chemo- and radiation therapy, but cure can usually be achieved by surgery.

A meta-analysis of comparative genomic hybridization studies performed for this review, as well as gene expression profiling data indicates separate clustering of carcinoids and carcinomas. Chromosomal aberrations are much more frequent in carcinomas, except for deletion of 11q, which is involved in the whole spectrum of NE lung tumors. Deletions of chromosome 3p are rare in carcinoids but are a hallmark of the high grade pulmonary NE carcinomas. On the contrary, mutations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene are restricted to carcinoid tumors.

Many of the differences between carcinoids and high grade lung NETs can be ascribed to tobacco consumption, which is strongly linked to the occurrence of high grade NE carcinomas. Smoking causes p53 mutations, very frequently present in SCLCs and LCNECs, but rarely in carcinoids. It further results in other early genetic events in SCLCs and LCNECs, such as 3p and 17p deletions. Smoking induces downregulation of E-cadherin and associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Also, high grade lung NETs display higher frequencies of aberrations of the Rb pathway, and of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic routes. Carcinoid biology on the other hand is not depending on cigarette smoke intake but rather characterized by aberrations of other specific genetic events, probably including Menin or its targets and interaction partners. This results in a gradual evolution, most likely from proliferating pulmonary NE cells via hyperplasia and tumorlets towards classical carcinoid tumors.

We conclude that carcinoids and high grade NE lung carcinomas are separate biological entities and do not comprise one spectrum of pulmonary NETs. This implies the need to reconsider both diagnostic as well as therapeutic approaches for these different groups of malignancies. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

10.1016/j.bbcan.2012.04.008,The biological kinship of hypoxia with CSC and EMT and their relationship with deregulated expression of miRNAs and tumor aggressiveness,"Abstract: Hypoxia is one of the fundamental biological phenomena that are intricately associated with the development and aggressiveness of a variety of solid tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) function as a master transcription factor, which regulates hypoxia responsive genes and has been recognized to play critical roles in tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemo-radiation resistance, and contributes to increased cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, tumor hypoxia with deregulated expression of HIF and its biological consequence lead to poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with solid tumors, resulting in higher mortality, suggesting that understanding of the molecular relationship of hypoxia with other cellular features of tumor aggressiveness would be invaluable for developing newer targeted therapy for solid tumors. It has been well recognized that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic cells are associated with therapeutic resistance and contribute to aggressive tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and believed to be the cause of tumor recurrence. Interestingly, hypoxia and HIF signaling pathway are known to play an important role in the regulation and sustenance of CSCs and EMT phenotype. However, the molecular relationship between HIF signaling pathway with the biology of CSCs and EMT remains unclear although NF-kappa B, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Notch, Wnt/beta-catenin, and Hedgehog signaling pathways have been recognized as important regulators of CSCs and EMT. In this article, we will discuss the state of our knowledge on the role of HIF-hypoxia signaling pathway and its kinship with CSCs and EMT within the tumor microenvironment. We will also discuss the potential role of hypoxia-induced microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor development and aggressiveness, and finally discuss the potential effects of nutraceuticals on the biology of CSCs and EMT in the context of tumor hypoxia.

10.1016/j.bbcan.2012.06.001,Role of BAG3 protein in leukemia cell survival and response to therapy,"Abstract: The ability of BAG3, a member of the BAG family of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 - cochaperones, to sustain the survival of human primary B-CLL and ALL cells was recognized about nine years ago. Since then, the anti-apoptotic activity of BAG3 has been confirmed in other tumor types, where it has been shown to regulate the intracellular concentration and localization of apoptosis-regulating factors, including NF-kappa B-activating (IKK gamma) and Bcl2-family (Bax) proteins. Furthermore, growing evidences support its role in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia response to therapy. Moreover in the last years, the contribution of BAG3 to autophagy, a process known to be involved in the pathogenesis and response to therapy of leukemia cells, has been disclosed, opening a new avenue for the interpretation of the role of this protein in leukemias' biology.

10.1016/j.bbcan.2012.06.003,"Ascorbic acid: Chemistry, biology and the treatment of cancer","Abstract: Since the discovery of vitamin C, the number of its known biological functions is continually expanding. Both the names ascorbic acid and vitamin C reflect its antiscorbutic properties due to its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues. Ascorbate acts as an electron-donor keeping iron in the ferrous state thereby maintaining the full activity of collagen hydroxylases; parallel reactions with a variety of dioxygenases affect the expression of a wide array of genes, for example via the HIF system, as well as via the epigenetic landscape of cells and tissues. In fact, all known physiological and biochemical functions of ascorbate are due to its action as an electron donor. The ability to donate one or two electrons makes AscH(-) an excellent reducing agent and antioxidant. Ascorbate readily undergoes pH-dependent autoxidation producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the presence of catalytic metals this oxidation is accelerated. In this review, we show that the chemical and biochemical nature of ascorbate contribute to its antioxidant as well as its prooxidant properties. Recent pharmacokinetic data indicate that intravenous (i.v.) administration of ascorbate bypasses the tight control of the gut producing highly elevated plasma levels; ascorbate at very high levels can act as prodrug to deliver a significant flux of H2O2 to tumors. This new knowledge has rekindled interest and spurred new research into the clinical potential of pharmacological ascorbate. Knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms of action of pharmacological ascorbate bring a rationale to its use to treat disease especially the use of i.v. delivery of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant in the treatment of cancer.

Defining past range changes/fragmentations during interglacial periods may provide tools to understand possible impacts of global warming on present biodiversity. To test this assumption we studied a marker gene in the bush-cricket Poecilimon birandi, a species confined to South-west Anatolia that demands a cold climate. Haplotypes of P. birandi constituted three main phylogroups,West, East and Demre. All haplotypes are unique to the respective phylogroup. An AMOVA suggested considerable divergence at all hierarchical levels. Though there is a strong isolation between phylogroups, the East and West groups harbour considerable haplotype diversity. Most of the demographic analyses suggest stable historical populations for the West and East phylogroups, but a coalescent-based demographic analysis indicates a bottleneck for the West phylogroup. The main conclusions are; (i) P. birandi contains considerable phylogenetic signal in 16S rDNA, (ii) there were at least three contemporaneous radiations, which might have originated from isolated refugial populations during Pleistocene, (iii) within a refugium, range changes induced by climatic shifts may be only vertical through an altitudinal gradient, (iv) significant genetic structure can arise in a small heterogeneous area, if the species requires particular habitats and has weak dispersal ability, (v) climatic shifts may cause fragmentation or extinction of populations, but can also lead to divergence of populations suffering from fragmentation, and (vi) altitudinal heterogeneity plays a buffering role, allowing for survival of the refugial biodiversity.

10.1002/bit.24571,Confined 3D microenvironment regulates early differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells,"Abstract: The therapeutic potential of human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells is threatened, among various problems, by the difficulty to homogenously direct cell differentiation into specific lineages. The transition from hPSC into committed differentiated cells is accompanied by secretome activity, remodeling of extracellular matrix and self-organization into germ layers. In this work, we aimed to investigate how different three-dimensional microenvironments regulate the early differentiation of the three germ layers in human embryonic stem (hES) cells derived embryoid bodies. In particular, a permeable, biocompatible, hydrogel microwell array was specifically designed for recreating a confined niche in which EB secreted molecules accumulate in accordance with hydrogel diffusional cut-off. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique was performed to accurately evaluate hydrogel permeability, mesh size and diffusional cutoff for soluble molecules. Three different culture conditions of EB culture were analyzed: suspension, confinement in microwells of width/depth ratio 1:1 and 1:2. Results show that EBs cultured in microwells are viable and have comparable average size after 8 days culture. Whole genome microarrays show that significative differential gene expression was observed between suspension and confined EBs culture. In particular, EBs culture in microwells promotes the expression of genes involved in pattern specification processes, brain development, ectoderm and endoderm differentiation. On the contrary, suspension EBs express instead genes involved in mesoderm specification and heart development. These results suggest that local accumulation of EBs secreted molecules drives differentiation patterns, as confirmed by immunofluorescence of germ layer markers, in hydrogel confined EB culture from both hES cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. Our findings highlight an additional potential role of biomaterial in controlling hPSC differentiation through secreted factor niche specification. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 31193132.

10.1002/bit.24574,Global regulator engineering significantly improved Escherichia coli tolerances toward inhibitors of lignocellulosic hydrolysates,"Abstract: Lignocellulosic biomass is regarded as the most viable source of feedstock for industrial biorefinery, but the harmful inhibitors generated from the indispensable pretreatments prior to fermentation remain a daunting technical hurdle. Using an exogenous regulator, irrE, from the radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans, we previously showed that a novel global regulator engineering (GRE) approach significantly enhanced tolerances of Escherichia coli to alcohol and acetate stresses. In this work, an irrE library was subjected to selection under various stresses of furfural, a typical hydrolysate inhibitor. Three furfural tolerant irrE mutants including F1-37 and F2-1 were successfully obtained. The cells containing these mutants reached OD600 levels of 4- to 16-fold of that for the pMD18T cells in growth assay under 0.2% (v/v) furfural stress. The cells containing irrE F1-37 and F2-1 also showed considerably reduced intracellular oxygen species (ROS) levels under furfural stress. Moreover, these two irrE mutants were subsequently found to confer significant cross tolerances to two other most common inhibitors, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF), vanillin, as well as real lignocellulosic hydrolysates. When evaluated in LuriaBertani (LB) medium supplemented with corn stover cellulosic hydrolysate (prepared with a solid loading of 30%), the cells containing the mutants exhibited lag phases markedly shortened by 2444?h in comparison with the control cells. This work thus presents a promising step forward to resolve the inhibitor problem for E. coli. From the view of synthetic biology, irrE can be considered as an evolvable part for various stresses. Furthermore, this GRE approach can be extended to exploit other exogenous global regulators from extremophiles, and the native counterparts in E. coli, for eliciting industrially useful phenotypes.

HA/ZrO2 composite powder prepared by using powder of HA and ZrO2 with different proportions sintered at 1600 degrees C were compared with pure HA powder and pure ZrO2 powder. The effects of the composite powder suspensions on the proliferation of the rabbit MSCs were measured by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assay), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were measured by the ALP colorimetric assay, and the cellular expression levels of Collagen I, osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNAs were determined by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The HA phase was transformed into the beta-Ca-3(PO4)(2)(beta-TCP), alpha-Ca-3(PO4)(2) and CaZrO3 phases in the composite powder after sintering at 1600 degrees C, with a positive correlation between the contents of the HA phase and the new phases. The MIT assay showed that both pure HA powder and HA containing composite powder were able to promote cellular proliferation, but pure ZrO2 powder had no effect in stimulating cell proliferation (P < 0.05). Vonkossa staining revealed that the composites and pure HA powder were capable of reducing the percentages of positively stained cells. The ALP colorimetric assay demonstrated that the ALP activities of cells maintained in culture media with HA and HA containing composite powder were significantly higher than that of cells cultured in regular media or media containing pure ZrO2 (P < 0.05). RT-PCR results showed that the composite powder were able to stimulate the expression of Collagen I and osteocalcin. The HA/ZrO2 composite powder can also facilitate osteogenic differentiation.

10.1111/cbdd.12040,"Discovery of Potent, Novel Nrf2 Inducers Via Quantum Modeling, Virtual Screening, and In Vitro Experimental Validation","Abstract: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the master transcription factor of the antioxidant response element pathway, coordinating the induction of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. Nrf2 is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1). To identify novel small molecules that will disturb Nrf2Keap1 binding and promote activation of the Nrf2- antioxidant response element pathway, we generated a quantum model based on the structures of known Nrf2- antioxidant response element activators. We used the quantum model to perform in silico screening on over 18 million commercially available chemicals to identify the structures predicted to activate the Nrf2- antioxidant response element pathway based on the quantum model. The top hits were tested in vitro, and half of the predicted hits activated the Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway significantly in primary cell culture. In addition, we identified a new family of Nrf2-antioxidant response element-activating structures that all have comparable activity to tBHQ and protect against oxidative stress and dopaminergic toxins in vitro. The improved ability to identify potent activators of Nrf2 through the combination of in silico and in vitro screening described here improves the speed and cost associated with screening Nrf2-antioxidant response element -activating compounds for drug development.

10.1111/cbdd.12046,Probing Secondary Glutaminyl Cyclase (QC) Inhibitor Interactions Applying an in silico-Modeling/Site-Directed Mutagenesis Approach: Implications for Drug Development,"Abstract: Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) catalyze the formation of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid peptides deposited in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease. Inhibitors of QC are currently in development as potential therapeutics. The crystal structures of the potent inhibitor PBD150 bound to human and murine QC (hQC, mQC) have been described recently. The binding modes of a dimethoxyphenyl moiety of the inhibitor are significantly different between the structures, which contrasts with a similar Ki value. We show the conformation of PBD150 prone to disturbance by proteinprotein interactions within the crystals. Semi-empirical calculations of the enzymeinhibitor interaction within the crystal suggest significant differences in the dissociation constants between the binding modes. To probe for interactions in solution, a site-directed mutagenesis on hQC was performed. The replacement of F325 and I303 by alanine or asparagine resulted in a 800-fold lower activity of the inhibitor, whereas the exchange of S323 by alanine or valine led to a 20-fold higher activity of PBD150. The results provide an example of deciphering the interaction mode between a target enzyme and lead substance in solution, if co-crystallization does not mirror such interactions properly. Thus, the study might provide implications for rapid screening of binding modes also for other drug targets. "," Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Medicinal "

With the purpose of developing molecules with the highest probability for blocking the adverse effects of these two oncogenes, we designed AL622, which contains a quinazoline head targeted to EGFR and a linker that bridges it to the PP2-like structure for targeting c-Src. In case the entire molecule would not be capable of blocking c-Src, we designed AL622 to hydrolyze to an intact c-Src-targeting PP2 molecule. After confirming its binary c-Src-EGFR targeting potency of AL622, we analyzed its potency in isogenic NIH3T3 cells transfected with EGFR and HER2 and human breast cancer cells known to be dominated by c-Src function. The results showed that in EGFR/HER-2-driven cells, it was more potent than PP2 and its activity was in the same range as the latter in more c-Src-driven cells. Its ability to block motility and invasion was comparable with that of PP2 and corresponding combinations, indicating that AL622 could be a better antitumor agent in cells where c-Src and/or EGFR play a role.

The pathogen was identified based on bacteriological characteristics and pathogenicity tests and the identity of strains was confirmed by DAS ELISA and PCR amplification using primers CMM5/6 and PSA4/R. The strains showed homogeneity in biochemical and physiological properties. However, pathogenicity tests revealed differences in virulence that are presumably due to a loss of the pat-1 gene. Further strain characterization using DNA-based methods revealed a high diversity of the Serbian Cmm strains. Based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of five genes, Cmm strains were divided into seven groups. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern of a selection of strains supported the groupings based on trees of the kdpA/sdhA sequences. On the other hand, groupings made according to PFGE and MLST were not correlated to plasmid content in all cases. This study suggested that high genetic variability of the Serbian Cmm strains was detected both in MLST and PFGE analyses, and could have resulted either from new Cmm strains being introduced by seeds from different origins or as a consequence of an intraspecific hybridization process. In addition, this study proposed MLST as an efficient tool in epidemiological studies, population biology investigations and tracking the routes of transmission of pathogens. Four of the five house-keeping genes (kdpA, sdhA, ligA and gyrB) selected to characterize Cmm strains proved to be suitable for the MLST analysis.

These characteristics include a lymphocytic infiltrate at the target organs, the presence of antigen-reactive T and B cells and antibodies, and the establishment of animal models of GD by antibody transfer or immunization with antigen. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, risk factors for GD include the presence of multiple susceptibility genes, including certain HLA alleles, and the TSHR gene itself. In addition, a variety of known risk factors and precipitators have been characterized including the influence of sex and sex hormones, pregnancy, stress, infection, iodine and other potential environmental factors. The pathogenesis of GD is likely the result of a breakdown in the tolerance mechanisms, both at central and peripheral levels. Different subsets of T and B cells together with their regulatory populations play important roles in the propagation and maintenance of the disease process.
