Depending upon the discipline, complex systems theory has accrued many flavors. We are after a formal representation, a model that can predict the outcome of a complex adaptive system (CAS). In this article, we look at the nature of complexity, then provide a perspective based on discrete event systems (DEVS) theory. We pin down many of the shared features between CAS and artificial systems. We begin with an overview of network science showing how adaptive behavior in these scale-free networks can lead to emergence through stigmergy in CAS. We also address how both self-organization and emergence interplay in a CAS. We then build a case for the view that stigmergic systems are a special case of CAS. We then discuss DEVS levels of systems specifications and present the dynamic structure extensions of DEVS formalism that lends itself to a study of CAS and in turn, stigmergy. Finally, we address the shortcomings and the limitation of current DEVS extensions and propose the required augmentation to model stigmergy and CAS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is not unexpected, therefore, that a large number, and wide variety, of proposed approaches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals in vitro are based upon the use of cultured DC or DC-like cells. The use of DC in this context is legitimate. However, with our rapidly increasing understanding of the diversity of cutaneous DC with respect to both phenotype and function, it is timely now to review briefly the potential limitations and interpretive difficulties that are associated with the use of DC-based assays. Among the important considerations are the fact that chemical-induced changes in the characteristics and function of cultured DC will not necessarily reflect accurately the events that that support the development of skin sensitization in vivo. In addition, most DC-based assays are predicated on a view that cutaneous DC have as their primary function the initiation of adaptive immune responses. However, it is now appreciated that cutaneous DC, and in particular epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), may also play important immunoregulatory roles that serve to limit and contain skin immune responses. Notwithstanding these considerations there is reason to believe that at least some in vitro DC-based assays are of value, and indeed some are currently the subject of a formal validation process. However, it is appropriate that such assays are configured and interpreted carefully, and with an appreciation of the complexity of DC biology.

Objective: This article aims to review what is known about the pathogenesis of PIH secondary to external insults and its relationship to the resultant degree of quantitative changes in melanocytes.

Methods: We performed a review of articles exploring PIH resulting from external cutaneous insults retrieved through database searching. We reviewed relevant articles for the pathogenesis, histopathology, and quantitative changes in melanocytes related to specific etiologies of PIH. Methodologies to quantify pigmentation changes in dermatologic conditions with clinical hyperpigmentation were also explored.

Results: Significant increases in melanocyte counts of irritant affected skin is seen compared with melanocyte counts of unaffected skin. An increase in melanocyte counts was also found for spontaneous inflammatory dermatoses, even in the absence of clinical hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, changes in melanocyte density and appearance are also seen secondary to inflammation. In addition, increases in epidermal melanocytes are seen with cutaneous exposure to certain agents, and melanocyte increases vary by exposure agent.

Conclusions: The degree of hyperpigmentation related to the intensity and duration of exposure to the causative factors of PIH is essential to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease process. The application of new methodologies to determine quantitative changes in melanocytes elicited by specific causative inflammatory agents has implications to prevent PIH, add to knowledge about disease duration, to develop better treatments for PIH, and to aid our understanding of the biology of the melanocyte.

The contribution of AnxA1 to human cell biology is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of AnxA1 and its receptor, formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), to the regulation of inflammatory responses in human normal lung fibroblasts (NLF). Silencing constitutive AnxA1 expression in NLF using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with moderate but significant increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced proliferation and interleukin (IL)-6 production, accompanied by reduction of ERK and NF-kappa B activity. AnxA1 regulation of ERK and NF-kappa B activation was associated with effects on proliferation. Blocking FPR2 using the specific antagonist WRW4 mimicked the effects of AnxA1 silencing on TNF-induced proliferation, IL-6, ERK, and NF-kappa B activation. AnxA1 silencing also impaired inhibitory effects of glucocorticoid on IL-6 production and on the expression of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), but blocking FPR2 failed to mimic these effects of AnxA1 silencing. These data suggest that AnxA1 regulates TNF-induced proliferation and inflammatory responses in lung fibroblasts, via effects on the ERK and NF-kappa B pathways, which depend on FPR2. AnxA1 also mediates effects of glucocorticoids and GILZ expression, but these effects appear independent of FPR2. These findings suggest that mimicking AnxA1 actions might have therapeutic potential in chronic inflammatory lung diseases. J. Cell. Physiol. 228: 476484, 2013. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Firstly, we prove global existence of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem without any smallness assumption on the initial data. Secondly, we prove both global existence and asymptotic behavior of smooth solutions, provided the initial data are of small H-1-norm energy but possibly large H-s-norm energy. Finally, if the H-s boolean AND L-1-norm of initial data are sufficiently small, we also establish decay rates of the global smooth solutions. These results are obtained by constructing a new nonnegative convex entropy and combining spectral analysis with energy methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was motivated by some problems arising from computational biology, for reverse engineering the structure of mechanisms in gene regulatory networks. For this purpose polynomial expressions have to be generated, which match known state combinations observed during experiments. Earlier approaches using Grobner techniques have not been powerful enough to treat real-world applications.

The proposed method avoids expensive Grobner basis computations completely by directly calculating reduced normal forms. The problem statement can be described by Boolean polynomials, i.e. polynomials with coefficients in {0, 1} and a degree bound of one for each variable. Therefore, the reference implementations mentioned in this work are built on the top of the POLYBORI framework, which has been designed exclusively for the treatment of this special class of polynomials.

A series of randomly generated examples is used to demonstrate the performance of the direct method. It is also compared with other approaches, which incorporate Grobner basis computations.

The most frequent type, clear-cell carcinoma, is not homogenous regarding gene mutations or transcriptomic profiles, but the biologic classifications are not yet mature. Therefore, biologically driven strategies of treatment have not yet been developed in the clinical setting. The choice of first-line agent currently depends on the prognostic criteria published by Motzer et al. [J Clin Oncol 1999;17:2530-2540] and recently by Heng et al. [J Clin Oncol 2009;27:5794-5799], with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies for good- or intermediate-prognosis groups and anti-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for poor-risk patients. In the past years, biological changes leading to resistance to targeted agents have been widely investigated. Discoveries resulted in the development of second-generation VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, characterized by an improved potency and selectivity. Besides, co-inhibition of signalling pathways mediating resistance to anti-VEGF are being developed targeting fibroblast growth factor and c-Met. Dual mTOR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors have greater efficacy than rapalogs in preclinical models and are being investigated in early clinical trials. In conclusion, the changing landscape in the biology and treatment of kidney cancer offers new opportunities for clinicians to treat patients, but, due to relatively high costs, the use of targeted therapies will likely be strongly controlled by health authorities.

In contrast, lineage committed cells acquire an extended symmetrical cell cycle. Self-renewal of tissue-specific stem cells is sustained by asymmetric cell division where one progeny cell remains a progenitor while the partner progeny cell exits the cell cycle and differentiates. There are three principal contexts for considering the operation and regulation of the pluripotent cell cycle: temporal, regulatory, and structural. The primary temporal context that the pluripotent self-renewal cell cycle of hESCs is a short G1 period without reducing periods of time allocated to S phase, G2, and mitosis. The rules that govern proliferation in hESCs remain to be comprehensively established. However, several lines of evidence suggest a key role for the naive transcriptome of hESCs, which is competent to stringently regulate the embryonic stem cell (ESC) cell cycle. This supports the requirements of pluripotent cells to self-propagate while suppressing expression of genes that confer lineage commitment and/or tissue specificity. However, for the first time, we consider unique dimensions to the architectural organization and assembly of regulatory machinery for gene expression in nuclear microenviornments that define parameters of pluripotency. From both fundamental biological and clinical perspectives, understanding control of the abbreviated ESC cycle can provide options to coordinate control of proliferation versus differentiation. Wound healing, tissue engineering, and cell-based therapy to mitigate developmental aberrations illustrate applications that benefit from knowledge of the biology of the pluripotent cell cycle. J.

A special form of this equation is the Hutchinson-Wright equation which is a mile stone in the mathematical modeling of population dynamics and mathematical biology. Taking the delay parameter as a bifurcation parameter, Hopf bifurcation analysis is studied by following the theory in the book by Hazzard et al. By analyzing the associated characteristic polynomial, we determine necessary conditions for the linear stability and Hopf bifurcation. In addition to this analysis, the direction of bifurcation, the stability and the period of a periodic solution to this equation are evaluated at a bifurcation value by using the Poincare normal form and the center manifold theorem.

The sensing behaviour of probe 1 was studied by UV-Vis and flourescence spectroscopy. Probe 1 showed excellent high selectivity and sensitivity towards Hg2+ over commonly coexistent metal ions in neutral solution, which could be attributed to the Hg2+-triggered ring opening of the spirolactam of the rhodamine moiety and the formation of a 1:1 1-Hg2+ complex.

The pathobiological mechanisms of human AAA are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to identify novel pathways involved in the development of AAAs. Methods: A custom-designed 'AAA-chip' was used to assay 43 of the differentially expressed genes identified in a previously published microarray study between AAA (n = 15) and control (n = 15) infrarenal abdominal aorta. Protein analyses were performed on selected genes. Results: Altogether 38 of the 43 genes on the 'AAA-chip' showed significantly different expression. Novel validated genes in AAA pathobiology included ADCY7, ARL4C, BLNK, FOSB, GATM, LYZ, MFGE8, PRUNE2, PTPRC, SMTN, TMODI and TPM2. These genes represent a wide range of biological functions, such as calcium signaling, development and differentiation, as well as cell adhesion not previously implicated in AAA pathobiology. Protein analyses for GATM, CD4, CXCR4, BLNK, PLEK, LYZ, FOSB, DUSP6, ITGA5 and PTPRC confirmed the mRNA findings. Conclusion: The results provide new directions for future research into AAA pathogenesis to study the role of novel genes confirmed here.

The groups were daughter cells with no bud scars, and mother cells separated further by number of scars (one, two and more than two). Cells with more than three scars were very rare.

Compression testing by micromanipulation was used to determine key mechanical properties of the sorted cells. For all cells the force and fractional deformation at bursting could be determined. For 69% of cells overall but only 32% of daughter cells, a large strain mathematical model using a linear elastic constitutive equation for the wall material could be fitted to force deformation data up to cell wall failure. For these cells, the wall surface modulus, elastic modulus, initial stretch ratio and strain energy per unit volume at bursting could be estimated. For the remainder of the cells, the lack of permanent deformation on repeated compression and release (at deformations not causing bursting) suggested the cell wall material was non-linear elastic but with no observable plastic behaviour.

This is the first report to show directly that bud scars affect the global mechanical properties of yeast cells and that the important distinction with respect to scars is between daughter and mother cells. The former were smaller with more elastic walls and a higher mean initial stretch ratio. For cells for which the model could be fitted, the mean circumferential strain at bursting decreased with scarring (consistent with stiffer walls) whilst the stress increased. This may be due to the reported absence of chitin in the walls of daughter cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

NO is synthesized by several nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and often functions through its second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG). This study combined NO imaging, immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology to localize NO and its downstream signaling pathways in the mouse retina. Neuronal NOS (nNOS) was localized primarily in puncta in the inner plexiform layer, in amacrine cells, and in somata in the ganglion cell layer. Endothelial NOS was in blood vessels. Light-stimulated NO production imaged with diaminofluorescein was present in somata in the inner nuclear layer and in synaptic boutons in the inner plexiform layer. The downstream target of NO, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), was in somata in the inner and outer nuclear layers and in both plexiform layers. Cyclic GMP immunocytochemistry was used functionally to localize sGC that was activated by an NO donor in amacrine, bipolar, and ganglion cells. Cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) Ia was found in bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and both plexiform layers, whereas PKG II was found in the outer plexiform layer, amacrine cells, and somata in the ganglion cell layer. This study shows that the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway is functional and widely distributed in specific cell types in the outer and inner mouse retina. A better understanding of these signaling pathways in normal retina will provide a firm basis for targeting their roles in retinal pathology. J. Comp. Neurol. 520:42044217, 2012.

The current manuscript presents an analysis of multi-scale interactions involved in D. discoideum aggregation and non-aggregation events. The multi-scale fractal dimensions of a sequence of microscope images were used to estimate changing structure at different spatial scales. Three regions showing aggregation and three showing non-aggregation were considered. The results showed that both aggregation and non-aggregation regions were strongly multi-fractal. Analyses of the over-time relationships among nine scales of the generalized dimension, D(q), were conducted using vector autoregression and vector error-correction models. Both types of regions showed evidence that across-scale interactions serve to maintain the equilibrium of the system. Aggregation and non-aggregation regions also showed different patterns of effects of individual scales on other scales. Specifically, aggregation regions showed greater effects of both the smallest and largest scales on the smaller scale structures. The results suggest that multi-scale interactions are responsible for maintaining and altering the cellular structures during aggregation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We encourage the incorporation of new sensors and new energy sources within the operational environment of UK-sustained observational programmes to bridge the gap that normally separates laboratory prototype from operational instrument. For interpreting the climate-change records obtained through a variety of national and international sustained observational programmes, creative and dedicated UK scientists should lead efforts to extract the meaningful signals and patterns of climate change and to interpret them so as to project future changes.

UK researchers have authored articles of high impact in all areas described here. In contrast to terrestrial geoscience, however, there have been few instrumented observations made of active processes by UK scientists. This is an area that could be developed over the next decades in the UK. Research on active processes has the potential ability to engage the wider public: Some active processes present significant geo-hazards to populations and offshore infrastructure that require monitoring and there could be commercial applications of technological developments needed for science. Some of the suggestions could involve studies in shallow coastal waters where ship costs are much reduced, addressing tighter funding constraints over the near term. The possibilities of measuring aspects of volcanic eruptions, flowing lava, turbidity currents and mass movements (landslides) are discussed. A further area of potential development is in greater collaboration between the ocean sciences. For example, it is well known in terrestrial geomorphology that biological agents are important in modulating erosion and the transport of sediments, ultimately affecting the shape of the Earth's surface in various ways. The analogous effect of biology on large-scale geomorphology in the oceans is also known but remains poorly quantified. Physical oceanographic models are becoming increasingly accurate and could be used to study further the patterns of erosion, particle transport and deposition in the oceans. Marine geological and geophysical data could in turn be useful for further verification of such models.

It is considered essential that computational model-building activities be at the centre of the initiative, driving an iterative process of development, testing and refinement. It is critical that the models provide mechanistic understanding and quantitative predictions. The aim would be to predict effects in humans: in order to help define a challenging but yet feasible initial goal the focus would be on liver mitochondrial toxicity.

Fibrillar collagen in the vascular wall plays a central role in tissue adaptation owing to its relatively short lifetime. Pathological alterations of collagen turnover may fail to result in homeostasis and could be responsible for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth at later stages of the disease. For this reason our previously reported multiscale constitutive framework (Martufi, G. & Gasser, T. C. 2011 J. Biomech. 44, 2544-2550 (doi:10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.07.015)) has been enriched by a collagen turnover model. Specifically, the framework's collagen fibril level allowed a sound integration of vascular wall biology, and the impact of collagen turnover on the macroscopic properties of AAAs was studied. To this end, model parameters were taken from the literature and/or estimated from clinical follow-up data of AAAs (on average 50.7 mm-large). Likewise, the in vivo stretch of the AAA wall was set, such that 10 per cent of collagen fibres were engaged. Results showed that the stretch spectrum, at which collagen fibrils are deposed, is the most influential parameter, i.e. it determines whether the vascular geometry grows, shrinks or remains stable over time. Most importantly, collagen turnover also had a remarkable impact on the macroscopic stress field. It avoided high stress gradients across the vessel wall, thus predicted a physiologically reasonable stress field. Although the constitutive model could be successfully calibrated to match the growth of small AAAs, a rigorous validation against experimental data is crucial to further explore the model's descriptive and predictive capabilities.

We used those flow fields to characterize the aerodynamic footprint in unprecedented detail and revealed previously unseen wake elements that would have gone undetected by two-dimensional or stereo-imaging technology. Vortex iso-surface topographies show the spatio-temporal signature of aerodynamic force generation manifest in the wake of locusts, and expose the extent to which animal wakes can deform, potentially leading to unreliable calculations of lift and thrust when using conventional diagnostic methods.

This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the 'relative stabilities' of N attractors (N > 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin-Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.

The gradient has been hypothesized to be dependent on the biology of the wasps, but recently questions of sampling and description biases have been raised. Here, we show with primary data that the species richness of Ichneumonidae is markedly underestimated in tropical areas and that latitudinal diversity patterns in the family remain uncharacterized. We discovered a startling 177 likely undescribed orthocentrine species with relatively low sampling effort in the forests of Central America and Amazonian Ecuador, over three times the previously known orthocentrine diversity in the world's tropics. Species accumulation curves reveal that we are just beginning to unveil the true extent of tropical orthocentrine diversity. We also found evidence for cryptic species; our DNA analysis revealed additional species not easily distinguishable using morphological characteristics. The difficulty in establishing species richness patterns of Ichneumonidae probably follows from the relative lack of taxonomic expertise and the low density of ichneumonid species throughout the landscape.

One topic of intense interest is the search of specific behavioural mechanisms at stake at the individual level and from which the school properties emerges. This is fundamental for understanding how selective pressure acting at the individual level promotes adaptive properties of schools and in trying to disambiguate functional properties from non-adaptive epiphenomena. Decades of studies on collective motion by means of individual-based modelling have allowed a qualitative understanding of the self-organization processes leading to collective properties at school level, and provided an insight into the behavioural mechanisms that result in coordinated motion. Here, we emphasize a set of paradigmatic modelling assumptions whose validity remains unclear, both from a behavioural point of view and in terms of quantitative agreement between model outcome and empirical data. We advocate for a specific and biologically oriented re-examination of these assumptions through experimental-based behavioural analysis and modelling.

Motility of the rod-shaped cells of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus depends on two motility machineries, type IV pili (giving rise to S-motility) and the gliding motility apparatus (giving rise to A-motility). Cell motility is regulated by occasional reversals. Moving M. xanthus cells can organize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies, depending on their nutritional status. To ultimately understand these two pattern-formation processes and the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as the cell reversal machinery, we analyse spatial self-organization in three M. xanthus strains: (i) a mutant that moves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, (ii) a unidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and (iii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, occasionally reverses its direction of movement. The mutant moving by means of the A-engine illustrates that collective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding bacteria owing to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need of invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant reveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are present, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the study of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces the formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while it results in vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are consistent with what is known from self-propelled rod models, which strongly suggests that the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions is the pattern-formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. On the other hand, we learn that when cells occasionally reverse their moving direction, as observed in the wild-type, cells form small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like structure at high enough densities. These results have been obtained from a careful analysis of the cluster statistics of ensembles of cells, and analysed in the light of a coagulation Smoluchowski equation with fragmentation.

Information about these interactions can improve our understanding of diseases and provide the basis to revolutionize therapeutic treatments. However, current experimental techniques for large-scale detection of protein-protein interactions are biased against membrane proteins, it is necessary to develop novel tools to deal with this kind of bio-network. To realize this, we construct membrane protein interaction network based on gene regulatory network model. Three model forms, basic form, non-dimensionalization form, and more complex form, are proposed to understand the dynamic and collective control of developmental process and the characters of membrane protein interaction network, including small-world network, scale free distributing and robustness, and its significance for biology. Four simulation examples are presented to illustrate the usefulness and flexibility of the GRN model method for the study of membrane protein interaction network. The results show that the proposed approach holds a high potential to become a useful tool in prediction of membrane protein interactions. Moreover, it has biological significance and value for biology and pharmacology. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sulfated fucans (SFs) and sulfated galactans (SGs) are one of these classes of glycans with increasing interest to both glycomics and medicine. Besides having very unique structures, some of these molecules exhibit a broad range of pharmacological actions. In certain cases, high levels of effectiveness may be reached when the proper structural requirements are found.

Scope of review: Here, we cover the fundamental biochemical mechanisms of some of these medicinal properties. We particularly focus on the beneficial activities of SFs and SGs in inflammation, hemostasis, vascular biology, and cancer.

Major conclusions: In these clinical systems. intermolecular complexes directly driven by electrostatic interactions of SFs and SGs with P- and L-selectins, chemokines, antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, thrombin, factor Xa, bFGF, and VEGF, overall govern the resultant therapeutic effects. In spite of that, the structural features of SFs and SGs have shown to be essential determinants for formation and stability of those molecular complexes, which consequently account to the differential levels of the biomedical responses.

General significance: Accurate structure-function relationships have mostly been achieved when SFs and SGs of well-defined structures are used for study. Therefore, these types of glycans have become of great usefulness to identify the chemical requirements needed to achieve satisfactory clinical responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

G-rich sequences are able to form quadruplex structures that have been proved to be involved in several important biological processes.

Methods: In this paper, we report investigations, based on calorimetric, UV, CD and electrophoretic techniques, on 12 oligodeoxynucleotides analogues of the quadruplex forming human telomere sequence d[TA(G(3)T(2)A)(3)G(3)], in which each guanine has been replaced, one at a time, by an abasic site mimic.

Results: Although all data show that the modified sequences preserve their ability to form quadruplex structures, the thermodynamic parameters clearly indicate that the presence of an abasic site decreases their thermal stability compared to the parent unmodified sequence, particularly if the replacement concerns one of the guanosines involved in the formation of the central G-tetrad.

Conclusions: The collected data indicate that the effects of the presence of abasic site lesions in telomeric quadruplex structures are site-specific. The most dramatic consequences come out when this lesion involves a guanosine in the centre of a G-run.

General significance: Abasic sites, by facilitating the G-quadruplex disruption, could favour the formation of the telomerase primer. Furthermore they could have implications in the pharmacological approach targeting telomere. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With rapid alterations of ecosystems occurring across the globe, organisms are being faced with sensory challenges that result in behavioural changes and disruptions with potential population-level consequences. Through a consideration of sensory ecology, it is possible to identify the underlying causes of disturbances at the individual level and use this information to develop better-informed, highly targeted, and more effective management strategies. Indeed, sensory-based approaches have already been successful in response to a variety of conservation issues. This article provides a general discussion of how a consideration of sensory ecology can benefit conservation biology and proceeds to describe three areas of rapid growth and potential for expansion: (1) mitigation of anthropogenic noise disturbance; (2) prevention and amelioration of ecological and other evolutionary traps; (3) targeted population control with special attention to aquatic invasive species.

Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations.

The focus in process improvement is often on understanding and manipulating the regulation of metabolism. Nonetheless, one encounters situations where organisms are remarkably resilient to further optimization or their properties become unstable. Therefore it is important to understand the origin of these apparent limitations to find whether and how they can be improved. We argue that by considering fitness effects of regulation, a more generic explanation for certain behaviour can be obtained. In this view, apparent process limitations arise from trade-offs that cells faced as they evolved to improve fitness. A deeper understanding of such trade-offs using a systems biology approach can ultimately enhance performance of cell factories.

The historical reduction in abundance and geographic distribution of the American plains bison (Bison bison bison) and their recovery over the last 125 years is well documented. However, introgression from domestic cattle (Bos taurus) into the few remaining bison populations that existed in the late 1800s has now been identified in many modern bison herds. We examined the phenotypic effect of this ancestry by comparing weight and height of bison with cattle or bison mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Santa Catalina Island, California (U.S.A.), a nutritionally stressful environment for bison, and of a group of age-matched feedlot bison males in Montana, a nutritionally rich environment. The environmental and nutritional differences between these 2 bison populations were very different and demonstrated the phenotypic effect of domestic cattle mtDNA in bison over a broad range of conditions. For example, the average weight of feedlot males that were 2 years of age was 2.54 times greater than that of males from Santa Catalina Island. In both environments, bison with cattle mtDNA had lower weight compared with bison with bison mtDNA, and on Santa Catalina Island, the height of bison with cattle mtDNA was lower than the height of bison with bison mtDNA. These data support the hypothesis that body size is smaller and height is lower in bison with domestic cattle mtDNA and that genomic integrity is important for the conservation of the American plains bison.

To identify virulence-associated genes to improve the biocontrol efficacy of M. acridum, it is necessary to understand the genes expressed by M. acridum during its infection of the insect host cuticle. In this study, we performed a large scale gene expression analysis of M. acridum during locust cuticle infection. We report the identification of 4,739 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs), of which 80 % have not been previously identified. Analysis of the ESTs provided evidence that M. acridum may employ several different adaptation strategies to infect locust cuticle, such as metabolism reprogramming, protein secretion, endocytosis, cell-cycle-regulated morphogenesis and effector-dependent suppression of host immune responses. By searching against the pathogen-host interaction database, several genes associated with different adaptation processes were found to potentially encode important virulence genes. Gene expression pattern analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that M. acridum differentially regulates subsets of genes in response to different infection niches between the host cuticle and hemolymph.

This issue of Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology is focused on primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Like every disorder, PID has its own specific history, starting with the discovery of agammaglobulinemia in 1952 and still expanding at a rapid pace, covering, at the time of this publication, more than 180 genetically determined disorders. However, as this report attempts to demonstrate, the history of PID is intertwined with the development of modern medicine and is the direct result of the innovative thinking of physician scientists who introduced new concepts in pathology, microbiology, biochemistry, and immunology, based on carefully designed experiments. As a consequence of the novel ideas put forth in the late 19th century, progress in public health, the discovery of antimicrobials, and the utilization of biologic products led to the recognition of genetically determined defects of Immunity and the design of effective treatment strategies.

Recent findings

The discovery of the structure of DNA, its replication, and the mapping of the human genome has transformed the field of PID into a predictable science of cutting edge therapies and diagnostic concepts.

However, data on the early stages of developing stereotypies are currently scarce. We compared the development of stereotypic route-tracing and somersaulting in hand-reared and wild-caught starlings placed in individual cages for the first time. We found that wild-caught birds were less active but showed more escape motivation and more evidence of route-tracing behavior. Furthermore, somersaulting was only observed in wild-caught birds. Development of somersaulting was predicted by subtle differences in behavior during the first few days in cages and developed in individuals with low levels of route-tracing behavior. Our data suggest a role for escape motivation in the development of starling stereotypies and additionally that route-tracing and somersaulting may represent alternative outlets for thwarted escape. In contrast to observations from mammals, our results show that stereotypies are more common in wild-caught starlings. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,Inc.

An intriguing aspect is the morphological and ecological similarity between H. pseudoalbidus and the native saprotroph Hymenoscyphus albidus. We revisited four localities where H. albidus apothecia were collected from 1989 to 2005 and established the current relationship of the species in these Danish ash stands based on microsatellites and differences in ITS sequences (used as CAPs marker). Scottish collections from 2010 supported the hypothesis that Danish herbarium samples prior to 2005 are identical to H. albidus still found in Scotland. The markers further revealed that herbarium samples from 1989 to 1994 were all H. albidus, while the latest collection (2005) was H. pseudoalbidus, which coincides with the first Danish symptom observations. Collections from 2010 were purely H. pseudoalbidus. We suggest that expanding H. pseudoalbidus excludes H. albidus from its niche resulting in H. albidus becoming a rare species in Denmark, which is perhaps already locally extinct.

A thorough knowledge of the biology of barnyardgrass is fundamental for designing effective resistance-management programmes. In the present study, seed production of barnyardgrass in response to time of emergence was investigated in cotton and rice, respectively, in Fayetteville and Rohwer, Arkansas, over a 2-year period (2008-09). Barnyardgrass seed production was greater when seedlings emerged with the crop, but some seed production was observed even if seedlings emerged several weeks after crop emergence. Moreover, barnyardgrass seed production was highly variable across environments. When emerging with the crop (0 weeks after crop emergence (WAE)), barnyardgrass produced c. 35500 and 16500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 39000 and 2900 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Seed production was observed when seedlings emerged up to 5 WAE (2008) or 7 WAE (2009) in cotton and up to 5 WAE (2008, 2009) in rice; corresponding seed production was c. 2500 and 1500 seeds/plant in cotton, and c. 14700 and 110 seeds/plant in rice, in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The results suggest that cultural approaches that delay the emergence of barnyardgrass or approaches that make the associated crop more competitive will be useful in integrated management programmes. In the context of herbicide resistance management, it may be valuable to prevent seed return to the seedbank, irrespective of cohorts.

To address this challenge and maximize the return on the efforts required for validating genomic screen hits, the screening strategy must be designed to increase the robustness of the primary screening hits and include assays that inform on the mechanism of action of the knocked-down transcripts. Here, we describe the implementation of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen to identify genes that sensitize the effect of poly-(ADP ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitor on cell survival. In the strategy we designed for the primary screen, two biological activities, apoptosis and cell viability, were measured simultaneously at different time points in the presence and absence of a PARP inhibitor (PARPi). The multiplexed assay allowed us to identify PARPi sensitizers induced by both caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms.

Titration of STARD5 with cholic (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), leads to drastic perturbation of the H-1-N-15 HSQC spectra and the identification of the residues in contact with those ligands.

There was a statistically significant bias in sex ratio toward females (Chi-square test, p<0.05) in both regions. The CCorrA resulted in a canonical correlation coefficient of 0.32 (p<0.00001). Both temperature and grain size composition of the sediment showed high correlation mainly with the presence of reproductive females, followed spermatophore-bearing males and recruits. In general, these demographic classes were most common in conditions of low temperature and fine sediments. These findings, as well as other studies carried out in colder regions with the same species, are consistent with the classical paradigm of lower longevity at lower latitudes. However, our results also suggest that this species maintained abiotic preference as populations located in cold temperate regions, mainly with temperature, indicating a different behavior from other shrimp species explored by fishery in the same region.

Previous works with Tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus (TBSV) revealed the recruitment of either peroxisomal or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes for replication. In case of Carnation Italian ringspot tombusvirus (CIRV), the mitochondrial membranes supported CIRV replication. In this study, we developed ER and mitochondrion-based in vitro tombusvirus replication assays. Using purified recombinant TBSV and CIRV replication proteins, we showed that TBSV could use the purified yeast ER and mitochondrial preparations for complete viral RNA replication, while CIRV preferentially replicated in the mitochondrial membranes. The viral RNA became partly RNase resistant after similar to 40 to 60 min of incubation in the purified ER and mitochondrial preparations, suggesting that assembly of TBSV and CIRV replicases could take place in the purified ER and mitochondrial membranes in vitro. Using chimeric and heterologous combinations of replication proteins, we showed that multiple domains within the replication proteins are involved in determining the efficiency of tombusvirus replication in the two subcellular membranes. Altogether, we demonstrated that TBSV is less limited while CIRV is more restricted in utilizing various intracellular membranes for replication. Overall, the current work provides evidence that tombusvirus replication could occur in vitro in isolated subcellular membranes, suggesting that tombusviruses have the ability to utilize alternative organellar membranes during infection that could increase the chance of mixed virus replication and rapid evolution during coinfection.

In order to keep the manufacturing process of the sensor simple, arrays of single split-ring-resonators are used. Two types of resonators, square and circular, are designed to cover different frequency ranges. An unknown material is then added as an overlayer to the metamaterial in order to explore the performance of the entire system in terms of sensing phenomenon. The changes in the transmission resonances are monitored upon variation of the thickness, the dielectric constant, and the coverage (distribution of the unknown material within each unit cell) of the overlayer. The results show good sensitivity of the sensors suggesting they can be used for a myriad of terahertz sensing applications in biology and chemistry.

Here, a comparative study between these proteomes was performed to find potential proteins and functions associated with human sperm maturation. Seven reproductive proteomes associated with human sperm physiology were integrated. Gene ontology analysis were performed using DAVID and Panther tools to determine enriched functions. Total of 270 proteins overlapped between epididymal, prostatic milieu and sperm proteome were thought to be candidate proteins involved in sperm maturation, and they showed enriched functions of proteasomal protein catabolic process and protein folding. 34 epididymal milieu proteins and 274 prostatic milieu proteins were contributed to the composition of seminal fluids proteome. Literatures have confirmed the involvements in sperm maturation of many of these proteins The spatial expressions of 24 epididymal milieu proteins involved in chaperone and antioxidant activity were authenticated by real-time RT-PCR. These proteins may serve as candidate molecules for future studies of sperm maturation and male infertility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LPL gene and to determine their associations between these polymorphisms and growth traits in Xiangxi cattle breed. In this study, six novel SNPs (C355157T, T355169C, T355186G, A355210G, T355348A and T355420C) and one reported SNP (A355427T, has been recorded in dbSNP, ID rs110590698) were detected using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing method. Genotyping and genetic diversity analysis were performed in 240 Xiangxi cattle on the basis of sequence alignment, which indicated that five SNPs (C355157T, 355186G, T355348A, T355420C, A355427T) were in abundant genetic diversity, and the other two SNPs (T355169C and TA355210G) were in low genetic diversity. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that 18 different haplotypes were identified in these animals. Moreover, the results of the association between LPL gene polymorphisms and growth traits indicated that the individuals with H1H1 haplotype combination had higher BW and HG than those with other haplotype combinations (P < 0.05). The animals with CC genotype maintain higher mean values for BW than those with the CT and TT genotypes (P < 0.05) at T355420C locus. The animals with the AA genotype have lower mean values for WH, BL, HG and BW than those with the AT and TT genotypes at A355427T locus (P < 0.05).

In this study, we reported the cloning of an IKK homologue cDNA (designated as AmphiIKK) from amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri. The full-length cDNA consists of 3,087 bp with an ORF that encoded a predicted protein of 777 amino acid residues. The putative amphioxus IKK protein possesses the characteristic organization of the mammalian IKK proteins, which consists of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a leucine zipper motif and a putative helix-loop-helix motif. And the deduced amino acid of AmphiIKK shared 43.8-64.0 % similarity and 23.6-43.3 % identified with the IKKs from other species. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that AmphiIKK was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and we also discovered that the expression of AmphiIKK was affected after lipopolysaccharides stimulation. Our findings help to highlight a potential important regulatory pathway in the innate immune response in the amphioxus and the evolution of the IKK family.

We examine the evolutionary relationships within the subfamily Halictinae (""sweat bees"") to investigate the origins of social behaviour within the tribe Halictini. We present a new phylogeny of the subfamily Halictinae based on three nuclear genes (elongation factor-1 alpha, wingless, and long-wavelength rhodopsin) and one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c oxidase 1) sequenced for 206 halictine bees. We use model-based character reconstruction to infer the probability of a shared eusocial ancestor for the genera Halictus and Lasioglossum, the two genera of Halictini which display eusociality. Our results suggest a high probability for a single origin of eusociality for these two genera, contradicting earlier views of separate origins within each taxon. Fossil-calibrated divergence estimates place this ancestor at approximately 35 million years ago, about 14 million years earlier than previous estimates of eusocial origins in the halictid bees.

Olive knot is present wherever olive is grown; although losses are difficult to assess, it is assumed that olive knot is one of the most important diseases of the olive crop. The last century witnessed a large number of scientific articles describing the biology, epidemiology and control of this pathogen. However, most P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi strains are highly recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, which has effectively prevented the pathogen from benefitting from the scientific progress in molecular biology that has elevated the foliar pathogens of the P.?syringae complex to supermodels. A number of studies in recent years have made significant advances in the biology, ecology and genetics of P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi, paving the way for the molecular dissection of its interaction with other nonpathogenic bacteria and their woody hosts. The selection of a genetically pliable model strain was soon followed by the development of rapid methods for virulence assessment with micropropagated olive plants and the analysis of cellular interactions with the plant host. The generation of a draft genome of strain NCPPB 3335 and the closed sequence of its three native plasmids has allowed for functional and comparative genomic analyses for the identification of its pathogenicity gene complement. This includes 34 putative type III effector genes and genomic regions, shared with other pathogens of woody hosts, which encode metabolic pathways associated with the degradation of lignin-derived compounds. Now, the time is right to explore the molecular basis of the P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoiolive interaction and to obtain insights into why some pathovars like it necrotic and why some like it knot. Synonyms Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi. Taxonomy Kingdom Bacteria; Phylum Proteobacteria; Class Gammaproteobacteria; Family Pseudomonadaceae; Genus Pseudomonas; included in genomospecies 2 together with at least P.?amygdali, P.?ficuserectae, P.?meliae and 16 other pathovars from the P.?syringae complex (aesculi, ciccaronei, dendropanacis, eriobotryae, glycinea, hibisci, mellea, mori, myricae, phaseolicola, photiniae, sesami, tabaci, ulmi and certain strains of lachrymans and morsprunorum); when a formal proposal is made for the unification of these bacteria, the species name P.?amygdali would take priority over P.?savastanoi. Microbiological properties Gram-negative rods, 0.40.8?x?1.03.0?mu m, aerobic. Motile by one to four polar flagella, rather slow growing, optimal temperatures for growth of 2530?degrees C; oxidase negative, arginine dihydrolase negative; elicits the hypersensitive response on tobacco; most isolates are fluorescent and levan negative, although some isolates are nonfluorescent and levan positive. Host range P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi causes tumours in cultivated and wild olive and ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Although strains from olive have been reported to infect oleander (Nerium oleander), this is generally not the case; however, strains of P.?savastanoi pv. nerii can infect olive. Pathovars fraxini and nerii are differentiated from pathovar savastanoi mostly in their host range, and were not formally recognized until 1996. Literature before about 1996 generally names strains of the three pathovars as P.?syringae ssp. savastanoi or P.?savastanoi ssp.

savastanoi, contributing to confusion on the host range and biological properties. Disease symptoms Symptoms of infected trees include hyperplastic growths (tumorous galls or knots) on the stems and branches of the host plant and, occasionally, on leaves and fruits. Epidemiology The pathogen can survive and multiply on aerial plant surfaces, as well as in knots, from where it can be dispersed by rain, wind, insects and human activities, entering the plant through wounds. Populations are very unevenly distributed in the plant, and suffer drastic fluctuations throughout the year, with maximum numbers of bacteria occurring during rainy and warm months. Populations of P.?savastanoi pv. savastanoi are normally associated with nonpathogenic bacteria, both epiphytically and endophytically, and have been demonstrated to form mutualistic consortia with Erwinia toletana and Pantoea agglomerans, which could result in increased bacterial populations and disease symptoms. Disease control Based on preventive measures, mostly sanitary and cultural practices. Integrated control programmes benefit from regular applications of copper formulations, which should be maintained for at least a few years for maximum benefit. Olive cultivars vary in their susceptibility to olive knot, but there are no known cultivars with full resistance to the pathogen.

Several components of body composition variability (fat/lean ratio, fat distribution, lean mass composition and metabolism, and adipose tissue biology) are increasingly linked with cardiometabolic risk and vary substantially across ethnic groups. Constituents of lean mass are proposed to contribute to metabolic capacity, a generic trait favouring the maintenance of homeostasis. Adiposity is proposed to contribute to metabolic load, which at higher levels challenges metabolic homeostasis, elevating cardiometabolic risk. Ethnic differences in body composition, representing different load-capacity ratios, may therefore contribute to ethnic variability in cardiometabolic risk. Ecological and evolutionary factors potentially contributing to ethnic variability in body composition are explored. In contemporary populations, clinicians encounter an increasing range of ethnicity, along with many individuals of mixed-ethnic ancestry. Increasing understanding of the contribution of body composition to cardiometabolic risk may reduce the need to treat ethnic groups as qualitatively different. A conceptual model is proposed, treating insulin sensitivity and stroke risk as composite functions of body composition variables. Operationalizing this model may potentially improve the ability to assess cardiovascular risk across the full ethnicity spectrum, and to predict cardiometabolic consequences of excess weight gain.

Experiments with different strengths of Hoaglands solution showed that all three pathogens survived at a broad range of EC levels for at least 3 days and were stimulated to grow and sporulate at ECs > 1.89 dS m-1. Recovery of initial populations after a 14-day exposure was over 20% for P. alni subsp. alni and P. kernoviae, and 61.3% and 130% for zoospores and sporangia of P. ramorum, respectively. Zoospore survival of these pathogens at ECs < 0.41 dS m-1 was poor, barely beyond 3 days in pure water; only 0.3% (P. alni), 2.9% (P. kernoviae) and 15.1% (P. ramorum) of the initial population survived after 14 days at EC = 0.21 dS m-1. The variation in rates of survival at different EC levels suggests that these pathogens survive better in cropping systems than in irrigation water. Containment of run-off and reduction in EC levels may therefore be non-chemical control options to reduce the risk of pathogen spread through natural waterways and irrigation systems.

There have, however, been few studies of the variation of pollen traits, especially variation of pollen size. Here, we describe the morphology of pollen grains from Pachycereus weberi, paying particular attention to variation of the diameter of the grains. We found that pollen grains from P. weberi are spheroidal, isopolar, and tricolpate, with microperforate and spinulate tectum and visible perine. Pollen diameter is highly variable.

These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.

We propose that use of the developing embryonic femur as a model to further understand skeletogenesis, and the effects of key differentiation agents, will aid our understanding of the developing bone niche and inform bone reparation. We have used a three-dimensional organotypic culture system of embryonic chick femora to investigate the effects of two key skeletal differentiation agents, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), on bone and cartilage development, using a combination of microcomputed tomography and histological analysis to assess tissue formation and structure, and cellular behavior.

Stimulation of embryonic day 11 (E11) organotypic femur cultures with PTH and PTHrP initiated osteogenesis. Bone formation was enhanced, with increased collagen I and STRO-1 expression, and cartilage was reduced, with decreased chondrocyte proliferation, collagen II expression, and glycosaminoglycan levels.

This study demonstrates the successful use of organotypic chick femur cultures as a model for bone development, evidenced by the ability of exogenous bioactive molecules to differentially modulate bone and cartilage formation. The organotypic model outlined provides a tool for analyzing key temporal stages of bone and cartilage development, providing a paradigm for translation of bone development to improve scaffolds and skeletal stem cell treatments for skeletal regenerative medicine.

Optimization of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profiles of biotherapeutics is crucial for clinical, as well as commercial, success of these drugs. This review focuses on the common questions and challenges in ADME optimization of biotherapeutics for inflammatory conditions. For these immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive biotherapeutics, special consideration should be given to the assessment of the interdependency of ADME profiles, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships, and immunogenicity profiles across various preclinical species and humans, including the interdependencies both in biology and in assay readouts. The context of usage, such as dosing regimens, extent of disease, concomitant medications, and drug product characteristics may have a direct or indirect (via modulation of immunogenicity) impact on ADME profiles of biotherapeutics. Along these lines, emerging topics include assessments of preexisting reactivity to a biotherapeutic agent, impact of immunogenicity on tissue exposure, and analysis of penetration to normal versus inflamed tissues. Because of the above complexities and interdependences, it is essential to interpret PK, PD, and anti-drug antibody results in an integrated manner. In addition, because of the competitive landscape in autoimmune and inflammatory markets, many pioneering ADME-centric protein engineering and subsequent in vivo testing (such as optimization of novel modalities to extend serum and tissue exposures and to improve bioavailability) are being conducted with biotherapeutics in this therapeutic area.

Their use, however, is often limited by availability of plant resources and may jeopardize rare species of medicinal plants. Plant cell cultures can serve as a renewable source of valuable secondary metabolites. To the date, however, only few examples of their commercial use are known. The main reasons for such a situation are the insufficient production of secondary metabolites and high cultivation costs. It is possible to increase the performance of plant cell cultures by one or two orders of magnitude using traditional methods, such as selection of highly productive strains, optimization of the medium composition, elicitation, and addition of precursors of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The progress in molecular biology methods brought about the advent of new means for increasing of the productivity of cell cultures based on the methods of metabolic engineering. Thus, overexpression of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the synthesis of the target product or, by contrast, repression of these genes significantly influences the cell biosynthetic capacity in vitro. Nevertheless, the attempts of the production of many secondary metabolites in plant cell culture were unsuccessful so far, probably due to the peculiarities of the cell culture as an artificial population of plant somatic cells. The use of plant organ culture or transformed roots (hairy root) could turn to be a considerably more efficient solution for this problem. The production of plant-derived secondary metabolites in yeast or bacteria transformed with plant genes is being studied currently. Although the attempts to use metabolic engineering methods were not particularly successful so far, new insights in biochemistry and physiology of secondary metabolism, particularly in regulation and compartmentation of secondary metabolite synthesis as well as mechanisms of their transport and storage make these approaches promising.

Recent data, however, suggests that two categories can be distinguished on basis of molecular and clinical data, i.e. the high grade neuroendocrine (NE) carcinomas and the carcinoid tumors.

Bronchial carcinoids and SCLCs may originate from the same pulmonary NE precursor cells, but a precursor lesion has only been observed in association with carcinoids, termed diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. The occurrence of mixed tumors exclusively comprising high grade NE carcinomas also supports a different carcinogenesis for these two groups. Histopathologically, high grade NE lung tumors are characterized by high mitotic and proliferative indices, while carcinoids are defined by maximally 10 mitoses per 2 mm(2) (10 high-power fields) and rarely have Ki67-proliferative indices over 10%. High grade NE carcinomas are chemosensitive tumors, although they usually relapse. Surgery is often not an option due to extensive disease at presentation and early metastasis, especially in SCLC. Conversely, carcinoids are often insensitive to chemo- and radiation therapy, but cure can usually be achieved by surgery.

A meta-analysis of comparative genomic hybridization studies performed for this review, as well as gene expression profiling data indicates separate clustering of carcinoids and carcinomas. Chromosomal aberrations are much more frequent in carcinomas, except for deletion of 11q, which is involved in the whole spectrum of NE lung tumors. Deletions of chromosome 3p are rare in carcinoids but are a hallmark of the high grade pulmonary NE carcinomas. On the contrary, mutations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene are restricted to carcinoid tumors.

Many of the differences between carcinoids and high grade lung NETs can be ascribed to tobacco consumption, which is strongly linked to the occurrence of high grade NE carcinomas. Smoking causes p53 mutations, very frequently present in SCLCs and LCNECs, but rarely in carcinoids. It further results in other early genetic events in SCLCs and LCNECs, such as 3p and 17p deletions. Smoking induces downregulation of E-cadherin and associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Also, high grade lung NETs display higher frequencies of aberrations of the Rb pathway, and of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic routes. Carcinoid biology on the other hand is not depending on cigarette smoke intake but rather characterized by aberrations of other specific genetic events, probably including Menin or its targets and interaction partners. This results in a gradual evolution, most likely from proliferating pulmonary NE cells via hyperplasia and tumorlets towards classical carcinoid tumors.

We conclude that carcinoids and high grade NE lung carcinomas are separate biological entities and do not comprise one spectrum of pulmonary NETs. This implies the need to reconsider both diagnostic as well as therapeutic approaches for these different groups of malignancies. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) function as a master transcription factor, which regulates hypoxia responsive genes and has been recognized to play critical roles in tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemo-radiation resistance, and contributes to increased cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, tumor hypoxia with deregulated expression of HIF and its biological consequence lead to poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with solid tumors, resulting in higher mortality, suggesting that understanding of the molecular relationship of hypoxia with other cellular features of tumor aggressiveness would be invaluable for developing newer targeted therapy for solid tumors. It has been well recognized that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic cells are associated with therapeutic resistance and contribute to aggressive tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and believed to be the cause of tumor recurrence. Interestingly, hypoxia and HIF signaling pathway are known to play an important role in the regulation and sustenance of CSCs and EMT phenotype. However, the molecular relationship between HIF signaling pathway with the biology of CSCs and EMT remains unclear although NF-kappa B, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Notch, Wnt/beta-catenin, and Hedgehog signaling pathways have been recognized as important regulators of CSCs and EMT. In this article, we will discuss the state of our knowledge on the role of HIF-hypoxia signaling pathway and its kinship with CSCs and EMT within the tumor microenvironment. We will also discuss the potential role of hypoxia-induced microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor development and aggressiveness, and finally discuss the potential effects of nutraceuticals on the biology of CSCs and EMT in the context of tumor hypoxia.

Since then, the anti-apoptotic activity of BAG3 has been confirmed in other tumor types, where it has been shown to regulate the intracellular concentration and localization of apoptosis-regulating factors, including NF-kappa B-activating (IKK gamma) and Bcl2-family (Bax) proteins. Furthermore, growing evidences support its role in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia response to therapy. Moreover in the last years, the contribution of BAG3 to autophagy, a process known to be involved in the pathogenesis and response to therapy of leukemia cells, has been disclosed, opening a new avenue for the interpretation of the role of this protein in leukemias' biology.

Both the names ascorbic acid and vitamin C reflect its antiscorbutic properties due to its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues. Ascorbate acts as an electron-donor keeping iron in the ferrous state thereby maintaining the full activity of collagen hydroxylases; parallel reactions with a variety of dioxygenases affect the expression of a wide array of genes, for example via the HIF system, as well as via the epigenetic landscape of cells and tissues. In fact, all known physiological and biochemical functions of ascorbate are due to its action as an electron donor. The ability to donate one or two electrons makes AscH(-) an excellent reducing agent and antioxidant. Ascorbate readily undergoes pH-dependent autoxidation producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the presence of catalytic metals this oxidation is accelerated. In this review, we show that the chemical and biochemical nature of ascorbate contribute to its antioxidant as well as its prooxidant properties. Recent pharmacokinetic data indicate that intravenous (i.v.) administration of ascorbate bypasses the tight control of the gut producing highly elevated plasma levels; ascorbate at very high levels can act as prodrug to deliver a significant flux of H2O2 to tumors. This new knowledge has rekindled interest and spurred new research into the clinical potential of pharmacological ascorbate. Knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms of action of pharmacological ascorbate bring a rationale to its use to treat disease especially the use of i.v. delivery of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant in the treatment of cancer.

Defining past range changes/fragmentations during interglacial periods may provide tools to understand possible impacts of global warming on present biodiversity. To test this assumption we studied a marker gene in the bush-cricket Poecilimon birandi, a species confined to South-west Anatolia that demands a cold climate. Haplotypes of P. birandi constituted three main phylogroups,West, East and Demre. All haplotypes are unique to the respective phylogroup. An AMOVA suggested considerable divergence at all hierarchical levels. Though there is a strong isolation between phylogroups, the East and West groups harbour considerable haplotype diversity. Most of the demographic analyses suggest stable historical populations for the West and East phylogroups, but a coalescent-based demographic analysis indicates a bottleneck for the West phylogroup. The main conclusions are; (i) P. birandi contains considerable phylogenetic signal in 16S rDNA, (ii) there were at least three contemporaneous radiations, which might have originated from isolated refugial populations during Pleistocene, (iii) within a refugium, range changes induced by climatic shifts may be only vertical through an altitudinal gradient, (iv) significant genetic structure can arise in a small heterogeneous area, if the species requires particular habitats and has weak dispersal ability, (v) climatic shifts may cause fragmentation or extinction of populations, but can also lead to divergence of populations suffering from fragmentation, and (vi) altitudinal heterogeneity plays a buffering role, allowing for survival of the refugial biodiversity.

The transition from hPSC into committed differentiated cells is accompanied by secretome activity, remodeling of extracellular matrix and self-organization into germ layers. In this work, we aimed to investigate how different three-dimensional microenvironments regulate the early differentiation of the three germ layers in human embryonic stem (hES) cells derived embryoid bodies. In particular, a permeable, biocompatible, hydrogel microwell array was specifically designed for recreating a confined niche in which EB secreted molecules accumulate in accordance with hydrogel diffusional cut-off. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique was performed to accurately evaluate hydrogel permeability, mesh size and diffusional cutoff for soluble molecules. Three different culture conditions of EB culture were analyzed: suspension, confinement in microwells of width/depth ratio 1:1 and 1:2. Results show that EBs cultured in microwells are viable and have comparable average size after 8 days culture. Whole genome microarrays show that significative differential gene expression was observed between suspension and confined EBs culture. In particular, EBs culture in microwells promotes the expression of genes involved in pattern specification processes, brain development, ectoderm and endoderm differentiation. On the contrary, suspension EBs express instead genes involved in mesoderm specification and heart development. These results suggest that local accumulation of EBs secreted molecules drives differentiation patterns, as confirmed by immunofluorescence of germ layer markers, in hydrogel confined EB culture from both hES cells and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. Our findings highlight an additional potential role of biomaterial in controlling hPSC differentiation through secreted factor niche specification. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 31193132.

Using an exogenous regulator, irrE, from the radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans, we previously showed that a novel global regulator engineering (GRE) approach significantly enhanced tolerances of Escherichia coli to alcohol and acetate stresses. In this work, an irrE library was subjected to selection under various stresses of furfural, a typical hydrolysate inhibitor. Three furfural tolerant irrE mutants including F1-37 and F2-1 were successfully obtained. The cells containing these mutants reached OD600 levels of 4- to 16-fold of that for the pMD18T cells in growth assay under 0.2% (v/v) furfural stress. The cells containing irrE F1-37 and F2-1 also showed considerably reduced intracellular oxygen species (ROS) levels under furfural stress. Moreover, these two irrE mutants were subsequently found to confer significant cross tolerances to two other most common inhibitors, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF), vanillin, as well as real lignocellulosic hydrolysates. When evaluated in LuriaBertani (LB) medium supplemented with corn stover cellulosic hydrolysate (prepared with a solid loading of 30%), the cells containing the mutants exhibited lag phases markedly shortened by 2444?h in comparison with the control cells. This work thus presents a promising step forward to resolve the inhibitor problem for E. coli. From the view of synthetic biology, irrE can be considered as an evolvable part for various stresses. Furthermore, this GRE approach can be extended to exploit other exogenous global regulators from extremophiles, and the native counterparts in E. coli, for eliciting industrially useful phenotypes.

HA/ZrO2 composite powder prepared by using powder of HA and ZrO2 with different proportions sintered at 1600 degrees C were compared with pure HA powder and pure ZrO2 powder. The effects of the composite powder suspensions on the proliferation of the rabbit MSCs were measured by the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assay), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities were measured by the ALP colorimetric assay, and the cellular expression levels of Collagen I, osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNAs were determined by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The HA phase was transformed into the beta-Ca-3(PO4)(2)(beta-TCP), alpha-Ca-3(PO4)(2) and CaZrO3 phases in the composite powder after sintering at 1600 degrees C, with a positive correlation between the contents of the HA phase and the new phases. The MIT assay showed that both pure HA powder and HA containing composite powder were able to promote cellular proliferation, but pure ZrO2 powder had no effect in stimulating cell proliferation (P < 0.05). Vonkossa staining revealed that the composites and pure HA powder were capable of reducing the percentages of positively stained cells. The ALP colorimetric assay demonstrated that the ALP activities of cells maintained in culture media with HA and HA containing composite powder were significantly higher than that of cells cultured in regular media or media containing pure ZrO2 (P < 0.05). RT-PCR results showed that the composite powder were able to stimulate the expression of Collagen I and osteocalcin. The HA/ZrO2 composite powder can also facilitate osteogenic differentiation.

Nrf2 is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1). To identify novel small molecules that will disturb Nrf2Keap1 binding and promote activation of the Nrf2- antioxidant response element pathway, we generated a quantum model based on the structures of known Nrf2- antioxidant response element activators. We used the quantum model to perform in silico screening on over 18 million commercially available chemicals to identify the structures predicted to activate the Nrf2- antioxidant response element pathway based on the quantum model. The top hits were tested in vitro, and half of the predicted hits activated the Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway significantly in primary cell culture. In addition, we identified a new family of Nrf2-antioxidant response element-activating structures that all have comparable activity to tBHQ and protect against oxidative stress and dopaminergic toxins in vitro. The improved ability to identify potent activators of Nrf2 through the combination of in silico and in vitro screening described here improves the speed and cost associated with screening Nrf2-antioxidant response element -activating compounds for drug development.

Inhibitors of QC are currently in development as potential therapeutics. The crystal structures of the potent inhibitor PBD150 bound to human and murine QC (hQC, mQC) have been described recently. The binding modes of a dimethoxyphenyl moiety of the inhibitor are significantly different between the structures, which contrasts with a similar Ki value. We show the conformation of PBD150 prone to disturbance by proteinprotein interactions within the crystals. Semi-empirical calculations of the enzymeinhibitor interaction within the crystal suggest significant differences in the dissociation constants between the binding modes. To probe for interactions in solution, a site-directed mutagenesis on hQC was performed. The replacement of F325 and I303 by alanine or asparagine resulted in a 800-fold lower activity of the inhibitor, whereas the exchange of S323 by alanine or valine led to a 20-fold higher activity of PBD150. The results provide an example of deciphering the interaction mode between a target enzyme and lead substance in solution, if co-crystallization does not mirror such interactions properly.

With the purpose of developing molecules with the highest probability for blocking the adverse effects of these two oncogenes, we designed AL622, which contains a quinazoline head targeted to EGFR and a linker that bridges it to the PP2-like structure for targeting c-Src. In case the entire molecule would not be capable of blocking c-Src, we designed AL622 to hydrolyze to an intact c-Src-targeting PP2 molecule. After confirming its binary c-Src-EGFR targeting potency of AL622, we analyzed its potency in isogenic NIH3T3 cells transfected with EGFR and HER2 and human breast cancer cells known to be dominated by c-Src function. The results showed that in EGFR/HER-2-driven cells, it was more potent than PP2 and its activity was in the same range as the latter in more c-Src-driven cells. Its ability to block motility and invasion was comparable with that of PP2 and corresponding combinations, indicating that AL622 could be a better antitumor agent in cells where c-Src and/or EGFR play a role.

The pathogen was identified based on bacteriological characteristics and pathogenicity tests and the identity of strains was confirmed by DAS ELISA and PCR amplification using primers CMM5/6 and PSA4/R. The strains showed homogeneity in biochemical and physiological properties. However, pathogenicity tests revealed differences in virulence that are presumably due to a loss of the pat-1 gene. Further strain characterization using DNA-based methods revealed a high diversity of the Serbian Cmm strains. Based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of five genes, Cmm strains were divided into seven groups. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern of a selection of strains supported the groupings based on trees of the kdpA/sdhA sequences. On the other hand, groupings made according to PFGE and MLST were not correlated to plasmid content in all cases. This study suggested that high genetic variability of the Serbian Cmm strains was detected both in MLST and PFGE analyses, and could have resulted either from new Cmm strains being introduced by seeds from different origins or as a consequence of an intraspecific hybridization process. In addition, this study proposed MLST as an efficient tool in epidemiological studies, population biology investigations and tracking the routes of transmission of pathogens. Four of the five house-keeping genes (kdpA, sdhA, ligA and gyrB) selected to characterize Cmm strains proved to be suitable for the MLST analysis.

However, the lack of standardized harvesting protocols has made regulation difficult. This, in combination with the impacts of oceanographic disturbances has resulted in some kelp populations being considerably reduced during the last decade. Consequently, harvest methods that maintain kelp resources are sorely needed if harvesting is to remain a viable industry in Chile. Here, experiments were done to identify sustainable methods for harvesting Macrocystis pyrifera along the coast of northern Chile. Three methods were compared with regard to their impacts on kelp populations; one that involves extracting half of the fronds from each individual in a population, one that involves extracting all the fronds from half of the individuals in a population, and a third that involves extracting all the fronds from all of the individuals in a population (i.e., the method currently used). Following this, populations were evaluated over a 2-month period to monitor re-growth of the remaining individuals and recruitment of new individuals, as well as changes in understory algal diversity and herbivore abundance. Our results indicate that removing half of the fronds from each individual in a population was the best method for maintaining the resource for future harvest because, it (1) maintains rapid growth of new fronds on the harvested individuals, (2) promotes recruitment of new individuals, and (3) reduces herbivore densities through physical abrasion.

This study seeks to understand how some biomaterials elicit anticoagulant responses from endothelial cells (ECs), whereas others do not. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to correlate the activity of four relevant signaling molecules [extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Akt, and I?B kinase (IKK)] with human umbilical vein EC secretion of prostacyclin and clotting time of whole blood in contact with these cells. Prostacyclin secretion was increased when JNK activity (mean of all time-points) was elevated and IKK activity at 30 min was reduced. In addition, the clotting time, R-time measured by thromboelastography, was increased (reduced coagulability) when activity of both ERK and JNK (mean of all time-points) were increased and when Akt activity was increased at longer contact times (2472 h after cell contact with material). Inhibition of each signaling molecule with subsequent testing for prostacyclin secretion and R-time confirmed the interrelationship between EC intracellular signaling and prostacyclin secretion. Generally, JNK inhibition decreased and IKK inhibition increased prostacyclin secretion. Inhibition of ERK or JNK generally increased coagulability, and Akt inhibition decreased the R-time of samples normally eliciting reduced coagulability. These findings increase our understanding of the signaling pathways involved in endothelial prostacyclin release and suggest targets for developing EC-seeded biomaterial surfaces that can minimize coagulation.

While effective vaccines against YF, JE and TBE are in widespread use, the development of a dengue vaccine has been hampered for a long time because of concerns of immunopathological consequences of vaccination. Phase III clinical trials with a recombinant chimeric live vaccine are now ongoing and will show whether the enormous problem of dengue can be resolved or at least reduced by vaccination in the future.

Unprecedented details of the flavivirus particle structure have become available through the combined use of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy that led to novel and surprising insights into the antigenic structure of these viruses. Recent studies provided evidence for an important role of virus maturation as well as particle dynamics in virus neutralization by antibodies and thus added previously unknown layers of complexity to our understanding of flavivirus immune protection. This information is invaluable for interpreting current investigations on the functional activities of polyclonal antibody responses to flavivirus infections and vaccinations and may open new avenues for studies on flavivirus cell biology and vaccine design.

In this study, 668 residents from the islands around the Tucurui Dam were selected. Blood samples were collected for investigation of serological markers (HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBS, and anti-HCV) by enzyme immunoassays. HCV-positive subjects were tested using RT-PCR and RFLP for the identification of viral genotypes. Among the 668 subjects studied, 1.9% were HBsAg positive, 28% were total anti-HBc positive, and 41.9% were anti-HBs positive. The anti-HBs marker alone (vaccine response) was detected in 25.7% of the volunteers. Anti-HCV antibody was detected in 2.2% of the subjects and genotype 1 was the predominant genotype (70%). The results indicate an intermediate level of HBV and HCV endemicity in the region studied, as well as low HBV vaccination coverage. J. Med. Virol. 84:19071912, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

At a Workshop at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Orthopaedic Research Society, we reviewed the molecular, cellular, and tissue scale approaches to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the periosteum's regenerative potential as well as translational therapies engineering solutions inspired by its remarkable regenerative capacity. The entire population of osteoblasts within periosteum, and at endosteal and trabecular bone surfaces within the bone marrow, derives from the embryonic perichondrium. Periosteal cells contribute more to cartilage and bone formation within the callus during fracture healing than do cells of the bone marrow or endosteum, which do not migrate out of the marrow compartment. Furthermore, a current healing paradigm regards the activation, expansion, and differentiation of periosteal stem/progenitor cells as an essential step in building a template for subsequent neovascularization, bone formation, and remodeling. The periosteum comprises a complex, composite structure, providing a niche for pluripotent cells and a repository for molecular factors that modulate cell behavior. The periosteum's advanced, smart material properties change depending on the mechanical, chemical, and biological state of the tissue. Understanding periosteum development, progenitor cell-driven initiation of periosteum's endogenous tissue building capacity, and the complex structurefunction relationships of periosteum as an advanced material are important for harnessing and engineering ersatz materials to mimic the periosteum's remarkable regenerative capacity.

Drechsl. ex Dast., are important diseases of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. However, the population biology of C. sativus is still poorly understood. In this study, the genetic structure of three C. sativus populations, consisting of isolates sampled respectively from barley leaves (BL), barley roots (BR) and wheat roots (WR) in North Dakota, was analysed with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 127 AFLP loci were generated among 208 C. sativus isolates analysed with three primer combinations. Gene diversity (H = 0.277-0.335) were high in all three populations. Genetic variation among C. sativus individuals within population accounted for 74%, whereas 26% of the genetic variation was explained among populations. Genetic differentiation was high (empty set PT = 0.261, corrected G ''(st)= 0.39), whereas gene flow (Nm) ranged from 1.27 to 1.56 among the three populations analysed. The multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) ((r) over bard = 0.0760.117) was moderate in C. sativus populations. Cluster analyses indicate that C. sativus populations differentiated according to the hosts (barley and wheat) and tissues (root and leaf) although generalists also exist in North Dakota. Crop breeding may benefit from combining genes for resistance against both specialists and generalists of C. sativus.

One hundred and eighty-four markers were chosen to determine genetic and genotypic diversity and to test the hypothesis of random mating and population differentiation of Rcc isolates. Among the 337 isolates collected, the overall gene diversity was moderate ((h) over cap = 0.216). The level of multilocus genotypic diversity was higher within populations than among them. All individuals had unique multilocus genotypes. Genetic differentiation was significant among populations in localities, but at a moderate level (theta = 0.12; P < 0.001), suggesting that gene flow is occurring among populations. The isolates from all twelve clusters produced by Structure were found in all local populations, although at different frequencies. Therefore, the inferred clusters did not represent geographical populations. Although the null hypothesis of random mating in Rcc populations was rejected, the high level of genotypic diversity suggests that the Rcc population structure appears to be generated by a mixed reproductive system including both asexual and sexual reproduction, along with a rather high migration rate.

Structural features responsible for the activity of the compounds were characterized by using physicochemical, topological, and electrotopological descriptors, calculated from the Molecular Design Suite software (V-life MDSTM 3.5). Correlations between the inhibitory activities (KDR and KDRcell) of aminopyrazolopyridine urea derivatives and the calculated descriptors were established through simulated annealing method. The best QSAR models generated from the study explain 89 and 88% of the variation in KDR and KDRcell inhibitory activities, respectively. Internal and external validation methods were used to evaluate the predictive capacity of the generated models. The significant cross-validated correlation coefficient (Q (2) > 0.6) and other statistical parameters suggest that the models exhibited considerable predictivity. The generated QSAR models divulge that factors related to lipophilicity and topological state of atoms in the molecule influences KDR and KDRcell inhibitory activities of aminopyrazolopyridine urea derivatives.

Metabolomics-a comprehensive study of global metabolites-has become a highly sensitive and powerful tool for biomarker discovery thanks to recent technological advances. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/TOF MS/MS)-based metabolomics approach was employed to investigate sera from galactosamine-treated rats to find potential biomarkers for acute liver injury. Hepatic damage was quantified by determining serum transaminase activity and in situ liver histological lesions. Principal component analysis in combination with coefficient of correlation analysis was used for biomarker selection and identification. According to the data, serum levels of several metabolites including glucose, amino acids, and membrane lipids were significantly modified, some of them showing a high correlation with the degree of liver damage determined by histological examination of the livers. In conclusion, this study supports that UPLC-MS/MS based serum metabolomics in experimental animal models could be a powerful approach to search for biomarkers for drug- or disease-induced liver injury.

Although data generated by different ""Omics"" technologies are usually considered and analyzed separately, their interrelation may offer a valuable opportunity for assessing the emerging 'integrated biology' concept. The overall strategy of analysis first investigated data pretreatment and variable selection for each dataset. Then, three multivariate analyses were applied to investigate the links between the abundance of metabolites and the expression of proteins collected on the same samples. Unfold principal component analysis and regularized canonical correlation analysis did not take into account the presence of groups of individuals related to the intervention study. On the contrary, the predictive MultiBlock Partial Least Squares method used this information. Regularized canonical correlation analysis appeared as a relevant approach to investigate of the relationships between the two datasets. However, in order to highlight the molecular compounds, proteins and metabolites, associated in interacting or common metabolic pathways for the experimental groups, MultiBlock partial least squares was the most appropriate method in the present nutritional case study.

The Network of Excellence EURRECA (EURopean micronutrient RECommendations Aligned) aims at harmonising micronutrient intake recommendations through population groups. The lack of proper markers of status for some micronutrients limits progress in this area: metabolomics could help identifying such new markers. We developed an original metabolomic strategy in order to monitor the largest fraction of a list of > 270 metabolites known to be influenced by the micronutrients of interest. To improve the coverage of these metabolites in plasma, a multi platform approach was performed using both liquid and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. A sample preparation protocol based on a three-step plasma fractionation has been set up, using both liquid and solid phase extractions. Four fractions were obtained containing respectively polar metabolites, neutral lipids, free fatty acids and polar lipids. Recoveries were determined using spiked plasma samples, and the advantages and drawbacks of the fractionation method compared to a commonly used single preparation step method were investigated in terms of metabolites detection and robustness. Fractionation improved coverage of the endogenous metabolome more than twice in terms of extracted features, allowing to identify 90 metabolites.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the central players in the regulation of gene expression, participating in many physiological processes. A comprehensive knowledge of miRNA expression in the human heart is essential for the understanding of myocardial function. The aim of this study was to compare the miRNA signature in human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. Agilent human miRNA arrays were used to indicate the miRNA expression signatures of the right atrial (n = 8) and ventricular (n = 9) myocardium of healthy individuals. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs) were used to validate the array results. DIANA-mirPath was used to incorporate the miRNAs into pathways. MiRNA arrays showed that 169 miRNAs were expressed at different levels in human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on the 169 dysregulated miRNAs showed that miRNA expression categorized two well-defined clusters that corresponded to human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. The qRT-PCR results correlated well with the microarray data. Bioinformatic analysis indicated the potential miRNA targets and molecular pathways. This study indicates that distinct miRNA expression signatures in human right atrial and ventricular myocardium. The findings provide a novel understanding of the molecular differences between human atrial and ventricular myocardium and may establish a framework for an anatomically detailed evaluation of cardiac function regulation.

From an applications perspective, it is desirable that second-generation bioenergy crops have lignin that is readily degraded by chemical pretreatments but still fulfill its biological role in plants. Because plants can tolerate large variations in lignin composition, often without apparent adverse effects, substitution of some fraction of the traditional monolignols by alternative monomers through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to tailor lignin in bioenergy crops. However, successful engineering of lignin incorporating alternative monomers requires knowledge about phenolic metabolism in plants and about the coupling properties of these alternative monomers. Here, we review the current knowledge about lignin biosynthesis and the pathways towards the main phenolic classes. In addition, the minimal requirements are defined for molecules that, upon incorporation into the lignin polymer, make the latter more susceptible to biomass pretreatment. Numerous metabolites made by plants meet these requirements, and several have already been tested as monolignol substitutes in biomimetic systems. Finally, the status of detection and identification of compounds by phenolic profiling is discussed, as phenolic profiling serves in pathway elucidation and for the detection of incorporation of alternative lignin monomers.

Conchologically driven species delineations in microgastropods (Carychiidae, Carychium)","Abstract: Valid taxonomic descriptions are paramount in evolutionary biology. Many date back centuries and are based on ambiguous morphological data. Microgastropods, in particular the taxon Carychiidae (Eupulmonata, Ellobioidea), demonstrate a paucity of informative conchological features. However, as exemplified by Carychium mariae Paulucci, 1878, their taxonomic classification is based almost entirely on these few features. Here we investigated the questionable taxonomic status of Carychium mariae combining DNA barcoding, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and conchological data. This taxon occurs in the Southern Alps, where it shows a sympatric distribution with two widely distributed members of Carychium-C. minimum Muller, 1774 and C. tridentatum (Risso, 1826). Our analyses do not support the species status of C. mariae. In contrast, DNA barcoding reveals a monophyletic grouping of C. minimum and C. mariae specimens with averaged intraspecific variability less than 3.2% (barcoding gap for Carychiidae). Hence, C. mariae is treated and should be regarded as a synonym of C. minimum, just representing a different morphotype. The differentiation and monophyletic status of C. tridentatum can be validated by showing an averaged interspecific variability of 5.9% to C. minimum. In general, we are critical of the sole use of conchological characters for microgastropod taxonomy and strongly recommend the implementation of molecular data (e.g., DNA barcoding) to reevaluate established species designations.

The SDS-PAGE investigations demonstrated that the molecular weight of the monomer unit is 62.5 kDa but the native-PAGE studies indicated that the mass of the enzyme is 240-250 kDa which proves the presence of a characteristic homo oligomer quaternary structure in solution phase. Optimal parameters of the enzyme activity were at pH 6.0 and 50 A degrees C. The enzyme showed little stability under pH 4.5 and above 60 A degrees C. The substrate specificity investigations indicated that the TfBXyl43 is an exo-glycosidase, hydrolyzing only xylobiose and -triose from the nonreducing end. Besides the enzyme shows very high specificity on the glycon part of the substrate, since it can only hydrolyze beta-d-xylopyranoside derivatives. The importance of hydrophobic interactions in the binding of the substrates are supported that the enzyme can hydrolize about four times more efficiently the artificial p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside substrate compared to the natural one, xylobiose. Furthermore we could detect transxylosidase activity both in the case of xylobiose and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside donors which is the first example among the inverting beta-d-xylosidases from T. fusca.

Although the general principles are understood, many details remain unclear. Specifically, protein folding rates are of interest because they dictate the rate of protein aggregation which underlies many human diseases. Here we offer predictions of protein folding rates and their correlation with folding nucleus sizes. We calculated free energies of the transition state and sizes of folding nuclei for 84 proteins and peptides whose other parameters were measured at the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between their unfolded and native states. We used the dynamic programming method where each residue was considered to be either as folded as in its native state or completely disordered. The calculated and measured folding rates showed a good correlation at the temperature mid-transition point (the correlation coefficient was 0.75). Also, we pioneered in demonstrating a moderate (-0.57) correlation coefficient between the calculated sizes of folding nuclei and the folding rates. Predictions made by different methods were compared. The established good correlation between the estimated free energy barrier and the experimentally found folding rate of each studied protein/peptide indicates that our model gives reliable results for the considered data set.

However, this theory remains unproven. Based on the common occurrence of enchondromas on routine knee MR imaging (2.9 %), one would expect to find displaced cartilage in the metaphysis of skeletally immature individuals on routine knee MR examinations if the above theory was to be supported.

The electronic databases of a specialist orthopedic hospital and children's hospital were searched for skeletally immature patients who underwent MR imaging of the knee for a variety of indications. Individuals with Ollier disease or hereditary multiple exostoses were excluded. The MR images were subsequently reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist for evidence of displaced cartilage into the metaphysis.

We reviewed 240 MR examinations of the knee that were performed in 209 patients. There were 125 MR studies in male and 115 MR examinations in female patients (age range: 5 months-16 years; median age: 13 years). In 97.1 %, the growth plates around the knee demonstrated a regular appearance. Seven cases (2.9 %) in six patients showed cartilage extension from the growth plate into the metaphysis, which remained in continuity with the growth plate. There were no cases of displaced cartilage into the metaphysis on MRI.

This construal of the selected effects theory conflicts with the existence and ubiquity of neurobiological functions that are evolutionary novel, such as structures underlying reading ability. This conflict has suggested to some that, while the selected effects theory may be relevant to some areas of evolutionary biology, its relevance to neuroscience is marginal. This line of reasoning, however, neglects the fact that synapses, entire neurons, and potentially groups of neurons can undergo a type of selection analogous to natural selection operating over an evolutionary time scale. In the following, I argue that neural selection should be construed, by the selected effect theorist, as a distinct type of function-bestowing process in addition to natural selection. After explicating a generalized selected effects theory of function and distinguishing it from similar attempts to extend the selected effects theory, I do four things. First, I show how it allows one to identify neural selection as a distinct function-bestowing process, in contrast to other forms of neural structure formation such as neural construction. Second, I defend the view from one major criticism, and in so doing I clarify the content of the view. Third, I examine drug addiction to show the potential relevance of neural selection to neuroscientific and psychological research.

Because of the documented effects on these traits of the LEPR c.1987C>T polymorphism, the LEP and LEPR c.1987C>T polymorphisms and their interactions have been jointly investigated. The LEP gene sequencing has allowed the identification of 39 polymorphisms, eight of which are novel. Three intronic SNPs, LEP g.1382C>T, LEP g.1387C>T and LEP g.1723A>G, have been genotyped, and association analyses have been carried out.

Monocyte recruitment into the vessel wall is a rate-limiting step in atherogenesis. Death of macrophage-derived foam cells promotes lesion progression and the majority of acute complications of atherosclerotic disease (e. g., myocardial infarction) occur in lesions that are intensely infiltrated with monocyte-derived macrophages, underlining the critical roles monocytes and macrophages play in this complex chronic inflammatory disease. Recent Advances: A rapidly growing body of literature supports a critical role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the regulation of monocyte and macrophage (dys) function associated with atherogenesis and macrophage death in atherosclerotic plaque.

One example is ovarian cancer, which colonizes the peritoneal cavity and especially the omentum. Our research indicates that the interaction of ovarian cancer cells with the omental microenvironment can activate a stress-kinase pathway involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4). A combination of clinical correlative and functional data suggests that MKK4 activation suppresses growth of ovarian cancer cells lodged in omentum. These findings prompted us to turn our focus to the cellular composition of the omental microenvironment and its role in regulating cancer growth. In this review, in addition to providing an overview of MKK4 function, we highlight a use for metastasis suppressors as a molecular tool to study cancer cell interaction with its microenvironment. We review features of the omentum that makes it a favorable microenvironment for metastatic colonization. In conclusion, a broader, evolutionary biology perspective is presented which we believe needs to be considered when studying the evolution of cancer cells within a defined microenvironment.

Because of its low dispersal potential and ease in capture, it has the potential to serve as a model species to investigate the effects of land cover change in the Neotropics on gene flow and population connectivity. To better understand aspects of B. variegatus biology, such as mating system and dispersal rates, we isolated and characterized 18 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Markers were tested using 32 B. variegatus individuals sampled from a site in northeastern Costa Rica. Each locus contained between three and 12 alleles, while mean expected and observed heterozygosity were equal to 0.72.

This progress has been spurred by the development of several learning principles and methods of instruction, including active learning, student-centered learning, collaborative learning, experiential learning, and problem-based learning. In the present paper, we suggest that these seemingly different strategies share important underlying characteristics and can be viewed as complimentary components of a broader approach to classroom instruction called transformational teaching. Transformational teaching involves creating dynamic relationships between teachers, students, and a shared body of knowledge to promote student learning and personal growth. From this perspective, instructors are intellectual coaches who create teams of students who collaborate with each other and with their teacher to master bodies of information. Teachers assume the traditional role of facilitating students' acquisition of key course concepts, but do so while enhancing students' personal development and attitudes toward learning. They accomplish these goals by establishing a shared vision for a course, providing modeling and mastery experiences, challenging and encouraging students, personalizing attention and feedback, creating experiential lessons that transcend the boundaries of the classroom, and promoting ample opportunities for preflection and reflection. We propose that these methods are synergistically related and, when used together, maximize students' potential for intellectual and personal growth.

The relationship between total length and weight for nine species (Amblyraja radiata, Dipturus batis-complex, Leucoraja fullonica, L. naevus, Raja brachyura, R. clavata, R. microocellata, R. montagui, and R. undulata) are provided for each sex and ICES ecoregion (when significantly different). Conversion factors for disc width to total length are provided. The lengths at first maturity and of the largest immature skates are reported for each sex, and the lengths at 50% maturity are estimated. Spatial differences in the length at maturity of R. clavata (females only) and L. naevus (both sexes) were observed. The lengths at maturity are discussed in relation to the results of earlier studies, and methodological differences are considered to have influenced reputed decreases in the length at maturity. A more standardized approach to collecting and reporting maturity information is required if potential spatial differences and temporal changes are to be investigated.

Biology of Apanteles myeloenta (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval parasitoid of carob moth Ectomyelais ceratoniae (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)","Abstract: The carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is the most important pest of pomegranate orchards (in terms of economic damage) within Iran, and hence, several control procedures, including biological methods of control, have been attempted as a means of controlling populations of this insect. This research was carried out in order to study the biology of Apanteles myeloenta (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval parasitoid of the carob moth. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine larval developmental time, adult longevity, sex ratio, parasite progeny production, and host stage preference of A. myeloenta. At 25 +/- 1 degrees C, immature developmental time (egg to pupa; mean +/- SE) was 28.33 +/- 0.85 days and 27.46 +/- 0.37 days for male and females, respectively. Adult females survived on average 17.5 +/- 0.14, 11.7 +/- 0.22, 3.4 +/- 0.18, and 2.8 +/- 0.12 days at 25 C when provided with honey and water, honey only, water only or no food source, respectively.

Recent studies have identified a new phenomenon involving the simultaneous generation of tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements, called chromothripsis. To understand the molecular consequences of these events, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of two prostate tumors exhibiting evidence of chromothripsis. We identified several complex fusion transcripts, each containing sequence from three different genes, originating from different parts of the genome. One such poly-gene fusion transcript appeared to be expressed from a chain of small genomic fragments. Furthermore, we detected poly-gene fusion transcripts in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, suggesting they may represent a common phenomenon. Finally in one tumor with chromothripsis, we identified multiple mutations in the p53 signaling pathway, expanding on recent work associating aberrant DNA damage response mechanisms with chromothripsis. Overall, our data show that chromothripsis can manifest as massively rearranged transcriptomes. The implication that multigenic changes can give rise to poly-gene fusion transcripts is potentially of great significance to cancer genetics. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

All of the cells subjected to ionizing radiations showed an increase of the activity of plasma membrane beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase and sialidase Neu3, in addition of the well known increase of activity of plasma membrane sphingomyelinase, under similar conditions. Human breast cancer cell line T47D was studied in detail. In these cells the increase of activity of beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase was parallel to the increase of irradiation dose up to 60 Gy and continued with time, at least up to 72 h from irradiation. beta-glucosidase increased up to 17 times and beta-galactosidase up to 40 times with respect to control. Sialidase Neu3 and sphingomyelinase increased about 2 times at a dose of 20 Gy but no further significant differences were observed with increase of radiation dose and time. After irradiation, we observed a reduction of cell proliferation, an increase of apoptotic cell death and an increase of plasma membrane ceramide up to 3 times, with respect to control cells. Tritiated GM3 ganglioside has been administered to T47D cells under conditions that prevented the lysosomal catabolism.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of UVA irradiation on the stemness properties of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). Furthermore, we examined the UVA-antagonizing effects of L-cysteine ethylester hydrochloride (ethylcysteine) and elucidated its action mechanisms. The results of this study showed that UVA reduced the proliferative potential and stemness of hAMSCs, as evidenced by reduced proliferative activity in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and downregulation of OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, stemness-related genes. The mRNA level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a, but not HIF-2a was reduced by UVA. Moreover, the knockdown of HIF-1a using small interfering RNA (siRNA) for HIF-1a was found to downregulate stemness genes, suggesting that UVA reduces the stemness through downregulation of HIF-1a. In addition, we examined the mechanisms underlying the UVA-mediated effects and found that UVA induced production of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and that this effect was mediated through activation of activating protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B). The UVA effects were antagonized by ethylcysteine, and the effects were found to be mediated by reduced production of PGE2 through the inhibition of JNK and p42/44 MAPK. Taken together, these findings show for the first time that UVA regulates the stemness of hAMSCs and its effects are mediated by downregulation of HIF-1a via the activation of PGE2cAMP signaling. In addition, ethylcysteine may be used as an antagonizing agent to mitigate the effects of UVA. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 36813691, 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S Background and Objective: To compare the levels of Selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized Selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. Material and Methods: Fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique. Between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the MannWhitney U-test. Results: Subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, S. sputigena and the Mitsuokella sp. Human Oral Taxon (HOT) 131 (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone CS002), while higher mean counts of Actinomyces gerencseriae and Streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Selenomonas sp. HOT 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. In the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of P.gingivalis and S.sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth = 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth = 3 mm) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, sites with probing depth of = 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects.

Active at neutral pH, they catalyze normal turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM) and are critical for maintaining tissue allostasis. Subtle coordination between MMP activity and its inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) insures ECM homeostasis. Loss of control of MMPs expression/activity in numerous pathologies usually associates with host response to injuries, facilitation of disease progression and significant tissue damage. In skeletal muscles, fragmentary knowledge of MMPsflIMPs regulation and function underscores the need for a better understanding of their role which may lead to therapeutic alternatives. This review presents the current knowledge of MMPs in the biology and pathology of skeletal muscles and puts into perspective therapeutic alternatives that could be challenged in experimental models or that might emerge from in depth investigation of MMPs/TIMPs status in neuromuscular diseases.

Through advanced analytical techniques, lipidomics is now emerging as a critical factor in our understanding of the pathology of a broad range of diseases. Recent Advances: During enzymatic or nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, the simple structure of an unsaturated fatty acid is converted to an oxylipidome, many members of which are electrophilic and form the reactive lipid species (RLS). This aspect of lipid biology is particularly important, as it directly connects lipidomics with proteomics through the post-translational modification of a sub-proteome in the cell. This arises, because the electrophilic members of the oxylipidome react with proteins at nucleophilic amino-acid residues and so change their structure and function to form electrophile-responsive proteomes (ERP). Critical Issues: Biological systems have relatively few but well-defined and mechanistically distinct pro-oxidant pathways generating RLS. Defining the ERPs and the mechanisms underlying their formation and action has been a major focus for the field of lipidomics and redox signaling. Future Directions: We propose that a unique oxylipidome can be defined for specific oxidants and will predict the biological responses through the reaction with proteins to form a specific ERP. In this review, we will describe the ERPs that modulate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protective pathways, including the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 and the promotion of cell death through interactions with mitochondria.

The underlying mechanisms for its functional change remain to be elucidated. Using 4T1 mammary tumor model that shares many characteristics with human breast cancer, particularly its ability to spontaneously metastasize to the lungs, we demonstrate that Gr-1+CD11b+ cells or myeloid derived suppressor cells are important mediators in TGF-beta regulation of mammary tumor progression. Depletion of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells diminished the antitumor effect of TGF-beta neutralization. Two mechanisms were involved: first, treatment with TGF-beta neutralization antibody (1D11) significantly decreased the number of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells in tumor tissues and premetastatic lung. This is mediated through increased Gr-1+CD11b+ cell apoptosis. In addition, 1D11 treatment significantly decreased the expression of Th2 cytokines and Arginase 1. Interestingly, the number and property of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells in peripheral blood/draining lymph nodes correlated with tumor size and metastases in response to 1D11 treatment. Our data suggest that the efficacy of TGF-beta neutralization depends on the presence of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells, and these cells could be good biomarkers for TGF-beta-targeted therapy.

Soils from mid-successional stages of balsam poplar and white spruce were separated into successive forest floor (Oe/Oa), buried organic horizons (BOHs), and mineral horizons; and water-extractable amino acid composition and concentration were determined by HPLC. The number, depth, and thickness of BOHs were highly variable across the landscape and among replicates of the same stand type, reflecting differences in terrace age, flood frequency, flood intensity, river channel position, vegetation inputs, and decomposition. BOHs generally had lower pH and bulk density, higher moisture content, and greater concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and roots than the surrounding mineral horizons. In each horizon of both successional stages, the soil amino acid pool was dominated by glutamic acid, glutamine, alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and histidine, which together accounted for approximately 80% of the total amino acids found. Despite the similar overall amino acid composition among the horizons, proportions of glutamine generally increased with depth and were generally greater in the mineral horizons than in the BOHs, suggesting root exudation or fine root turnover as an amino acid source. In both successional stages, amino acid concentrations were nearly always highest in the Oe/Oa horizon and rapidly decreased with depth. BOHs generally had greater amino acid concentrations than the surrounding mineral horizons in both successional stages, but amino acid concentrations in successive BOHs declined with depth in the soil profile, suggesting that although BOHs do remain as biological hot spots and potential nutrient reservoirs as far down as 60 cm depth, their importance declines over time.

Two sections of a large introductory biology course (>400 students/section) were zoned into a laptop-permitted and a laptop-free area. Two sections in which laptop users could sit anywhere served as the Control. There was no difference in the attendance (similar to 85%) or percentage of students using laptops (similar to 29%) between Zoned and Control sections. Academic performance, based on exam points earned, was not significantly different for paper users in Zoned and Control sections indicating laptop use did not impair the overall achievement of surrounding students. However, there was a correlation between exam performance and note taking preference: paper note takers scored significantly higher and laptop users scored significantly lower than predicted by pre-class academic indicators (p < 0.01, paired t-test). The majority of both laptop (64%) and paper users (82%) in the Zoned sections supported a policy restricting laptop use to specific areas. Thus, while we further investigate whether the relationship between laptop use and performance is correlative or causative, zoning is an effective method for accommodating both laptop users and paper note takers in the same lecture hall.

In addition, knowledge of the elastic modulus will allow design of substrates with relevant mechanical properties for in vitro investigations of cellular behavior. Previously, we have reported elastic modulus values for the anterior basement membrane and Descemet's membrane of the human cornea, the surfaces in contact with the epithelial and endothelial cells, respectively. We have completed the compliance profile of the stromal elements of the human cornea by obtaining elastic modulus values for Bowman's layer and the anterior stroma. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the elastic modulus, which is a measure of the tissue stiffness and is inversely proportional to the compliance. The elastic response of the tissue allows analysis with the Hertz equation, a model that provides a relationship between the indentation force and depth and is a function of the tip radius and the modulus of the substrate. The elastic modulus values for each layer of the cornea are: 7.5 +/- 4.2 kPa (anterior basement membrane), 109.8 +/- 13.2 kPa (Bowman's layer), 33.1 +/- 6.1 kPa (anterior stroma), and 50 +/- 17.8 kPa (Descemet's membrane). These results indicate that the biophysical properties, including elastic modulus, of each layer of the human cornea are unique and may play a role in the maintenance of homeostasis as well as in the response to therapeutic agents and disease states.

Generally, commercial AFM cantilevers, which have a sharp tip, are used for AFM experiments. In this review, we introduce micro-fabricated AFM cantilevers and show several applications for cell biology. In manipulation of samples on a cellular scale with a force of tens to hundreds of nano-Newtons, attempts have been made to secure the formation of covalent/non-covalent linkages between the AFM probe and the sample surface. However, present chemistry-based modification protocols of cantilevers do not produce strong enough bonds. To measure the tensile strength and other mechanical properties of actin-based thin filaments in both living and semi-intact fibroblast cells, we fabricated a probe with a hooking function by focused ion beam technology and used it to capture, pull and eventually break a chosen thin filament, which was made visible through fusion with fluorescent proteins.

Both principles involve an extreme value of the rate of entropy production in an open system at the steady state under non-equilibrium conditions.

There are two competing mechanisms of its internal working the indirect activation and the direct activation. In the absence of conclusive experimental data, we have used computational modeling to assess the properties of both mechanisms and their suitability to act as a biological switch. Since the two mechanisms form opposite poles of continuum of Bcl-2 molecular interaction models, we have constructed more general models including these two models as extreme cases. By studying the relationship between model parameters and the steady-state response we have found optimal interaction patterns which reproduce the behavior of the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch. Our results show, that stimulus-response ultrasensitivity is negatively affected by spontaneous activation of Bcl-2 effectors. We found that ultrasensitivity requires effectors activation, mediated by another subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins-activators. We have shown that the auto-activation of monomeric effector forms provides an ultrasensitivity enhancing feedback loop. Thorough robustness analysis revealed that the interaction pattern postulated in the direct activation hypothesis is able to conserve stimulus-response switching characteristics for wide range changes of its internal parameters. The robustness of the switch against the variation of the reaction parameter is strongly reduced for the intermediate hybrid model and even more for the indirect part of the models.

Currently available self-repairing architectures have, however, some limitations such as storage overhead required to prepare all possible rewiring strategies and temporal incorrectness caused by elongated repairing time. In this paper, we propose a novel self-repairing architecture for fast fault recovery with an efficient use of limited resources, which can be easily applied to real complex digital systems. The proposed architecture consists of three layers: a working layer, a control layer, and an interface layer. The working layer employs a hybrid scheme of using both redundant and empty cells with a newly devised self-test. This relieves the overhead of redundant cells required to be prepared in advance by considering every possible fault situation. In the control layer, an ordered assignment control is proposed. The order of working-priority of each processor that controls a normal cell in the working layer is predetermined. A faulty processor is detected by a majority decision among neighboring control processors and corrected by rearranging the order of working-priority. The interface layer connects an external PC for reprogramming. Through this fault recovery mechanism, the system can keep normal functioning under noisy environments. We implemented the proposed self-repairing architecture using an field-programmable gate array board with an application of a dot-matrix LED display and verified its robust operation. The proposed architecture can be widely used as a new platform for self-repairing systems.

Cellular systems maintain their robustness in the face of perturbations arising from environmental and genetic variations. By analogy to control engineering architectures, the complexity of modular structures within a cell can be attributed to the necessity of achieving robustness. To reveal such a biological design, the E. coli ammonia assimilation system is analyzed, which consists of complex but highly structured modules: the glutamine synthetase (GS) activity feedback control module with bifunctional enzyme cascades for catalyzing reversible reactions, and the GS synthesis feedback control module with positive and negative feedback loops. We develop a full-scale dynamic model that unifies the two modules, and we analyze its robustness and fine tuning with respect to internal and external perturbations. The GS activity control is added to the GS synthesis module to improve its transient response to ammonia depletion, compensating for the tradeoffs of each module, but its robustness to internal perturbations is lost. These findings suggest some design principles necessary for the synthesis of life.

However, current methodologies available for their preparations are not straightforward and take several hours of incubation time. In this paper, we describe a new filtration-assisted technique for covalent conjugation between the reactive functional groups of two different molecules (small or macromolecules). Compared to the current method, this new approach significantly reduces the total reaction time from several hours to just a few minutes. The technique has been used for the preparation of conjugates of a small molecule to a protein such as biotin-BSA conjugate or small molecules to a small molecule such as biotin-tyramine conjugate or protein-protein conjugation such as antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The procedure consists of filtering the reaction mixture multiple times through membrane micropores with the help of two syringes, which make the cross filtration process less laborious. The method saves time, allows conjugation of less than 1 mg protein and produces conjugates better than those obtained by the current methods. Although the present technique has been applied on some common conjugation methods, it provides a potentially general method, and may further be expanded for the synthesis of several other macromolecular conjugates.

Such work opens up new possibilities for language research on previously unsolvable problems, especially in areas where information from other sources may be lacking. I use phylogenetic methods to investigate Tasmanian languages. Existing materials are so fragmentary that scholars have been unable to discover how many languages are represented in the sources. Using a clustering algorithm which identifies admixture, source materials representing more than one language are identified. Using the Neighbor-Net algorithm, 12 languages are identified in five clusters. Bayesian phylogenetic methods reveal that the families are not demonstrably related; an important result, given the importance of Tasmanian Aborigines for information about how societies have responded to population collapse in prehistory. This work provides insight into the societies of prehistoric Tasmania and illustrates a new utility of phylogenetics in reconstructing linguistic history.

Here we present measurements on colloidal particles, which are confined in narrow channels on a substrate and interact with a barrier, which impedes the motion along the channel. The substrate of the particle is tilted in order for the particles to be driven towards the barrier and, if the energy gained by the tilt is large enough, surpass the barrier by thermal activation. We therefore study the influence of this barrier as well as the influence of particle interaction on the particle transport through such systems.

This technique is useful for molecular genetic analysis in cancer, stem cell, bacterial, non-invasive prenatal diagnosis in which many biologists are interested. This paper describes a self-priming compartmentalization (SPC) microfluidic chip platform for performing digital loop-mediated amplification (LAMP). The energy for the pumping is pre-stored in the degassed bulk PDMS by exploiting the high gas solubility of PDMS; therefore, no additional structures other than channels and reservoirs are required. The sample and oil are sequentially sucked into the channels, and the pressure difference of gas dissolved in PDMS allows sample self-compartmentalization without the need for further chip manipulation such as with pneumatic microvalves and control systems, and so on. The SPC digital LAMP chip can be used like a 384-well plate, so, the world-to-chip fluidic interconnections are avoided. The microfluidic chip contains 4 separate panels, each panel contains 1200 independent 6 nL chambers and can be used to detect 4 samples simultaneously. Digital LAMP on the microfluidic chip was tested quantitatively by using beta-actin DNA from humans. The self-priming compartmentalization behavior is roughly predictable using a two-dimensional model.

The present study therefore was to assess the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and direct current electric field (dcEF) on the growth and trafficking of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC). It was found that EGF did not affect cell proliferation in cell-culture flasks. However, ASC proliferated at a higher rate in microfluidic devices with continuous infusion of EGF. Furthermore, we found that ASC migrated toward an EGF gradient in microfluidic devices. Moreover, we found that ASC tended to position perpendicularly to dcEF.

Surprisingly, these arrangements are not only qualitatively, but also quantitatively similar for different plants. Several abstract mathematical models invoking general principles like circular symmetry and mutual repulsion of plant organs reproduce these characteristic features of phyllotaxis. Two such models, belonging to the class of field models, are analyzed in the present study, they were introduced by Thornley (1975), and by Douady and Couder (1992). It is numerically demonstrated that in the limit of high organ density their bifurcation diagrams (""divergence spectrum"") are self-similar under rescaling of two model parameters. Field models are known to give the classically expected behaviour only if the positioning of primordia is controlled exclusively by next-neighbor interactions (Kunz, 1995). In the general case, the bifurcation diagram of such models is topologically different and phyllotactic sequences converging to non-noble irrational divergences are possible. It is discussed how in these systems self-similarity and scaling together with the Farey tree structure of the divergence spectrum lead to a universal selection of asymptotic divergences with periodic continued fraction expansion [a(1),a(2),...,a(N),(kappa(1),kappa(2),...,kappa(P)) over bar], where the overlining denotes infinite repetition. Moreover, it is argued that for solutions easily accessible during growth, divergences are favored where all numbers N, P, a(1),a(2),..., and kappa(1),kappa(2,)... are small, thereby selecting in particular the noble limit divergences of the classically observed unijugate phyllotactic sequences.

These molecules were considered specific for the immune system. Recently, however, they were also found in epithelial and mesenchymal noncancerous and cancerous tissues and cell lines. In this article, we report that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B and HCC specimens express APRIL and BAFF and their receptors BCMA and BAFFR, but not TACI; APRIL/BCMA is enhanced in HCC, compared with normal liver tissue. In contrast to previous reports, APRIL binding to BCMA decreases cell proliferation by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest, whereas BAFF has no effect on cell growth. HCC cells therefore represent a rare system in which these two ligands ( APRIL and BAFF) exert a differential effect and may serve as a model for specific APRIL/BCMA actions. We show that the effect of APRIL is mediated via BCMA, which does not activate the classical NF-kappa B pathway, whereas it induces a novel signaling pathway, which involves JNK2 phosphorylation, FOXO3A activation, and GADD45 transcription. In addition, JNK2 mediates the phosphorylation of Akt, which is activated but does not participate in the antiproliferative effect of APRIL. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that APRIL modifies genes specifically related to cell cycle modulation, including MCM2/4/5/6, CDC6, PCNA, and POLE2.

In early perceptual processing, the superior colliculus (SC) takes a leading role in integrating visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli in order to direct eye movements. The SC forms a representation of multisensory space through a layering of retinotopic maps which are sensitive to different types of stimuli. These eye-centered topographic maps can adapt to crossmodal stimuli so that the SC can automatically shift our gaze, moderated by cortical feedback. In this paper we describe a neural network model of the SC consisting of a hierarchy of nine topographic maps that combine to form a multisensory retinotopic representation of audio-visual space. Our motivation is to evaluate whether a biologically plausible model of the SC can localize audio-visual inputs live from a camera and two microphones. We use spatial contrast and a novel form of temporal contrast for visual sensitivity, and interaural level difference for auditory sensitivity. Results are comparable with the performance observed in cats where coincident stimuli are accurately localized, while presentation of disparate stimuli causes a significant drop in performance. The benefit of crossmodal localization is shown by adding increasing amounts of noise to the visual stimuli to the point where audio-visual localization significantly out performs visual-only localization. This work demonstrates how a novel, biologically motivated model of low level multisensory processing can be applied to practical, real-world input in real-time, while maintaining its comparability with biology.

As evidence emerges that angiogenesis has significant mechanistic complexity, therapeutic resistance and escape have become practical limitations to drug development. Here, we review the mechanisms by which dynamic changes occur in the tumor microenvironment in response to antiangiogenic therapy, leading to drug resistance. These mechanisms include direct selection of clonal cell populations with the capacity to rapidly upregulate alternative proangiogenic pathways, increased invasive capacity, and intrinsic resistance to hypoxia. The implications of normalization of vasculature with subsequently improved vascular function as a result of antiangiogenic therapy are explored, as are the implications of the ability to incorporate and co-opt otherwise normal vasculature.

By and large, the mechanisms of action for viral and cellular helicases are not known. Moreover, in some cases, enzymatic activity is not even required for their roles in virus biology. Recently, we showed that expression of the host nucleolar helicase DDX56 is important for infectivity of West Nile virus (WNV) particles. In the present study, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of this enzyme is essential for its role in assembly of infectious WNV virions. Over-expression of the capsid-binding region of DDX56 also reduces infectivity of WNV suggesting that interaction of DDX56 and capsid protein is an important step in the virion assembly pathway.

SPOT-blot peptide arrays were used to screen for the methyllysine-containing histone peptides that bind to MBT domains found in nine human proteins. Selected interactions were quantified using fluorescence polarization assays. We show that all MBT proteins recognize only monomethyllysine and/or dimethyllysine marks and provide evidence that some MBT domains recognize a defined consensus sequence while others bind in a promiscuous, non-sequence-specific manner.

How phospholipids are transported to and in-between mitochondrial membranes remained unclear. We identified Ups1, a yeast member of a conserved family of intermembrane space proteins, as a lipid transfer protein that can shuttle phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes. Lipid transfer required the dynamic assembly of Ups1 with Mdm35 and allowed conversion of phosphatidic acid to cardiolipin in the inner membrane. High cardiolipin concentrations prevented membrane dissociation of Ups1, leading to its proteolysis and inhibiting transport of phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin synthesis. Thus, intramitochondrial lipid trafficking may involve a regulatory feedback mechanism that limits the accumulation of cardiolipin in mitochondria.

These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits(2-6), and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits(1,7). Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed.

It has also been proposed that cell fusion causes cancer and contributes to its progression. These functions rely on a poorly understood ability of cell fusion to create new cell types. We suggest that this ability can be understood by considering cells as attractor networks whose basic property is to adopt a set of distinct, stable, self-maintaining states called attractors. According to this view, fusion of two cell types is a collision of two networks that have adopted distinct attractors. To learn how these networks reach a consensus, we model cell fusion computationally. To do so, we simulate patterns of gene activities using a formalism developed to simulate patterns of memory in neural networks. We find that the hybrid networks can assume attractors that are unrelated to parental attractors, implying that cell fusion can create new cell types by nearly instantaneously moving cells between attractors. We also show that hybrid networks are prone to assume spurious attractors, which are emergent and sporadic network states. This finding means that cell fusion can produce abnormal cell types, including cancerous types, by placing cells into normally inaccessible spurious states. Finally, we suggest that the problem of colliding networks has general significance in many processes represented by attractor networks, including biological, social, and political phenomena.

This is also true for models of a cell's electrical activity; even within a narrowly defined population there can be considerable variation in electrophysiological phenotype. Here, we describe a computational experimental approach for parameterizing a model of the electrical activity of a cell in real time. We combine the inexpensive parallel computational power of a programmable graphics processing unit with the flexibility of the dynamic clamp method. The approach involves 1), recording a cell's electrical activity, 2), parameterizing a model to the recording, 3), generating predictions, and 4), testing the predictions on the same cell used for the calibration. We demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our approach using a cell line (GH4C1). These cells are electrically active, and they display tonic spiking or bursting. We use our approach to predict parameter changes that can convert one pattern to the other.

The model is described by the diffusion coefficient (d(alpha)) and proliferation rate (r(alpha)) of the species alpha (alpha = 1,2 is the species label). Propagating wave front solutions in one dimension are investigated analytically and by numerical solutions. It is found that the wave profiles and wave speeds are determined by the speed parameters, v(alpha) equivalent to 2 root d(alpha)r(alpha), of the two species, and the phase diagrams for various inter-and intracompetitive scenarios are determined. The steady wave front speeds are obtained analytically via nonlinear dynamics analysis and verified by numerical solutions. The effect of the intermediate stationary state is investigated and propagating wave profiles beyond the simple Fisher wave fronts are revealed. The wave front speed of a species can display abrupt increase as its speed parameter is increased. In particular for the case in which both species are aggressive, our results show that the speed parameter is the deciding factor that determines the ultimate surviving species, in contrast to the case without diffusion in which the final surviving species is decided by its initial population advantage. Possible relations to the biological relevance of modeling cancer development and wound healing are also discussed.

A hallmark of late-stage apoptosis is nuclear fragmentation in which DNA is degraded to release nucleosomes with their associated histones. In this work, a method was developed for detecting and measuring nucleosome concentration in vitro with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The indirect procedure used a commercially available secondary antibody-superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particle complex as a contrast agent that bound to primary antibodies against nucleosomal histones H4, H2A and H2B. Using a multiple-echo spin-echo sequence on a 1.5 T clinical MRI scanner, significant T-2 relaxation enhancement as a function of in vitro nucleosomal concentration was measured. In addition, clustering or aggregation of the contrast agent was demonstrated with its associated enhancement in T-2 effects. The T-2 clustering enhancement showed a complex dependence on relative concentrations of nucleosomes, primary antibody and secondary antibody + SPIO. The technique supports the feasibility of using MRI measurements of nucleosome concentration in blood as a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tool in the management of cancer.

The design of biological systems often employs structural information or structure-based protein design to successfully implement synthetic signaling circuits or for rewiring signaling flows. Here, we summarize the latest advances in using structural information for studying protein interaction and signaling networks, and in synthetic biology approaches. We then provide a perspective of how combining structural biology with engineered cell signaling modules-using additional information from quantitative biochemistry and proteomics, gene evolution, and mathematical modeling-can provide insight into signaling modules and the general design principles of cell signaling. Ultimately, this will improve our understanding of cell- and tissue-type-specific signal transduction.

Achieving this goal requires well-characterized components, modular implementation strategies, simulation across temporal and spatial scales and automatic compilation of high-level designs to low-level genetic parts that function reliably inside cells. Many of these steps are incomplete or only partially understood, and methods for integrating them within a common design framework have yet to be developed. Here, we address these challenges by developing a prototype framework for designing synthetic cells with prescribed population dynamics. We extend the genetic engineering of cells (GEC) language, originally developed for programming intracellular dynamics, with cell population factors such as cell growth, division and dormancy, together with spatio-temporal simulation methods. As a case study, we use our framework to design synthetic cells with predator-prey interactions that, when simulated, produce complex spatio-temporal behaviours such as travelling waves and spatio-temporal chaos. An analysis of our design reveals that environmental factors such as density-dependent dormancy and reduced extracellular space destabilize the population dynamics and increase the range of genetic variants for which complex spatio-temporal behaviours are possible. Our findings highlight the importance of considering such factors during the design process. We then use our analysis of population dynamics to inform the selection of genetic parts, which could be used to obtain the desired spatio-temporal behaviours. By identifying, integrating and automating key stages of the design process, we provide acomputational framework for designing synthetic systems, which could be tested in future laboratory studies.

However, deciphering the functional impact of microbial communities on host pathophysiology represents a formidable challenge, due to the heterogeneous distribution of chemical and microbial species within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Herein, we apply imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to localize metabolites from the interaction between the host and colonizing microbiota. This approach complements other molecular imaging methodologies in that analytes need not be known a priori, offering the possibility of untargeted analysis. Localized molecules within the GI tract were then identified in situ by surface sampling with nanodesorption electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (nanoDESI FTICR-MS). Products from diverse structural classes were identified including cholesterol-derived lipids, glycans, and polar metabolites. Specific chemical transformations performed by the microbiota were validated with bacteria in culture.

However, chemical reagents required in the lysis interfere with downstream molecular biology and often require removal after the step. Electrical lysis based on irreversible electroporation is a promising technique to prepare samples for genetic analysis due to its purely physical nature, fast speed, and simple operation. However, there has been no experimental confirmation on whether electrical lysis extracts genomic DNA from cells in a reproducible and efficient fashion in comparison to chemical lysis, especially for eukaryotic cells that have most of the DNA enclosed in the nucleus. In this work, we construct an integrated microfluidic chip that physically traps a low number of cells, lyses the cells using electrical pulses rapidly, then purifies and concentrates genomic DNA. We demonstrate that electrical lysis offers high efficiency for DNA extraction from both eukaryotic cells (up to, similar to 36% for Chinese hamster ovary cells) and bacterial cells (up to similar to 45% for Salmonella typhimurium) that is comparable to the widely used chemical lysis. The DNA extraction efficiency has dependence on both the electric parameters and relative amount of beads used for DNA adsorption. We envision that electroporation-based DNA extraction will find use in ultrasensitive assays that benefit from minimal dilution and simple procedures.

The main roles of the Menkes protein, ATP7A, are the delivery of copper to the secretory pathway and the export of excess copper from the enterocytes. The N-terminal domain of membrane protein ATP7A consists of six repetitive sequences of 60-70 amino acids (Mnk1-Mnk6) that fold into individual metal binding domains (MBDs) and bind a single copper ion in the reduced Cu-1 form via two cysteine residues. The structure of each individual MBD is known from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Here, we were interested in the stability and dynamics of each isolated MBD in their apo and holo forms and their interactions with the soluble metallochaperone HAH1 that delivers copper to ATP7A. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the MBDs under different conditions, we show that some MBDs (Mnk1 and Mnk5) present large root-mean-square deviations from initial structures or large root-mean-square fluctuations, and great care has to be taken in setting up the simulations. We propose that the first MBD, Mnk1, probably important in the transfer of copper between the metallochaperone and ATPase, could be stabilized by interactions with other MBDs, including a domain located in the loop between Mnk1 and Mnk2. An important result of this work is the apparent direct correlation between the difference in the fluctuations of the metal binding site loop in its apo and holo forms and the measured affinity of the MBD for copper. This difference decreases from Mnk1 to Mnk6, Mnk4, and Mnk2 in this order. The study of the exposure to the solvent of the metal and the residues of the metal binding loop of the MBDs also shows different behavior for each MBD. In particular, copper in serine-rich domain Mnk3 and largely fluctuating domain Mnk5 appears to be more solvent-exposed than in the other MBDs. In the second part of this work, we investigated the importance of electrostatics in the MBD-chaperone interactions using different docking programs. Mnk1 and Mnk4 present a large electrostatic dipole moment and large stabilizing interaction energies with HAH1 Finally, we propose a model structure of ATP7A from Mnk6 (E561) to P1413 based on the crystal structure of LpCopA and docking simulations.

However, many other kinds of processes contribute to evolutionary diversity. In vertical descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit is propagated by replication inside its own lineage. In what we call introgressive descent, the genetic material of a particular evolutionary unit propagates into different host structures and is replicated within these host structures. Thus, introgressive descent generates a variety of evolutionary units and leaves recognizable patterns in resemblance networks. We characterize six kinds of evolutionary units, of which five involve mosaic lineages generated by introgressive descent. To facilitate detection of these units in resemblance networks, we introduce terminology based on two notions, P3s (subgraphs of three nodes: A, B, and C) and mosaic P3s, and suggest an apparatus for systematic detection of introgressive descent. Mosaic P3s correspond to a distinct type of evolutionary bond that is orthogonal to the bonds of kinship and genealogy usually examined by evolutionary biologists. We argue that recognition of these evolutionary bonds stimulates radical rethinking of key questions in evolutionary biology (e.g., the relations among evolutionary players in very early phases of evolutionary history, the origin and emergence of novelties, and the production of new lineages). This line of research will expand the study of biological complexity beyond the usual genealogical bonds, revealing additional sources of biodiversity. It provides an important step to a more realistic pluralist treatment of evolutionary complexity.

Although several palliative treatments are available, there is currently no cure and patients generally die 10-15 y after diagnosis. Several promising approaches for HD therapy are currently in development, including RNAi and antisense analogs. We developed a complementary strategy to test repression of mutant HTT with zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) in an HD model. We tested a ""molecular tape measure"" approach, using long artificial ZFP chains, designed to bind longer CAG repeats more strongly than shorter repeats. After optimization, stable ZFP expression in a model HD cell line reduced chromosomal expression of the mutant gene at both the protein and mRNA levels (95% and 78% reduction, respectively). This was achieved chromosomally in the context of endogenous mouse HTT genes, with variable CAG-repeat lengths. Shorter wild-type alleles, other genomic CAG-repeat genes, and neighboring genes were unaffected. In vivo, striatal adeno-associated virus viral delivery in R6/2 mice was efficient and revealed dose-dependent repression of mutant HTT in the brain (up to 60%). Furthermore, zinc finger repression was tested at several levels, resulting in protein aggregate reduction, reduced decline in rotarod performance, and alleviation of clasping in R6/2 mice, establishing a proof-of-principle for synthetic transcription factor repressors in the brain.

Basic principles governing these search mechanisms remain poorly understood, and no study has provided direct visualization of single proteins searching for and engaging target sites. Here we use the postreplicative mismatch repair proteins MutS alpha and MutL alpha as model systems for understanding diffusion-based target searches. Using single-molecule microscopy, we directly visualize MutS alpha as it searches for DNA lesions, MutL alpha as it searches for lesion-bound MutS alpha, and the MutS alpha/MutL alpha complex as it scans the flanking DNA. We also show that MutL alpha undergoes intersite transfer between juxtaposed DNA segments while searching for lesion-bound MutS alpha, but this activity is suppressed upon association with MutS alpha, ensuring that MutS/MutL remains associated with the damage-bearing strand while scanning the flanking DNA. Our findings highlight a hierarchy of lesion- and ATP-dependent transitions involving both MutS alpha and MutL alpha, and help establish how different modes of diffusion can be used during recognition and repair of damaged DNA.

All materials respond in some way to an applied magnetic field, and iron-bearing minerals are sensitive to a range of environmental processes, which makes magnetic measurements extremely useful for detecting signals associated with environmental processes. Environmental magnetism has grown considerably since the mid 1970s and now contributes to research in the geosciences and in branches of physics, chemistry, and biology and environmental science, including research on climate change, pollution, iron biomineralization, and depositional and diagenetic processes in sediments to name a few applications. Magnetic parameters are used to routinely scan sediments, but interpretation is often difficult and requires understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry. Thorough examination of magnetic properties and of the environmental processes that give rise to the measured magnetic signal is needed to avoid ambiguities, complexities, and limitations to interpretations.

We describe how ambiguities can be resolved by use of combined techniques and demonstrate the power of environmental magnetism in enabling quantitative environmental interpretations.

Here we show that Turing patterns may have a decisive role in shaping the abundance distribution of predators and prey living in patchy landscapes. We extend the original model proposed by Nakao and Mikhailov [Nat.

We identify patterns of species distribution displaying high degrees of apparent competition driven by Turing instabilities.

Here, we study the effects of crowding due to car density and driving fluctuations on the transport of vehicles. Using a microscopic model for traffic, we found that crowding can push car movement from a superballistic down to a subdiffusive state. The transition is also associated with a change in the shape of the probability distribution of positions from a negatively-skewed normal to an exponential distribution. Moreover, crowding broadens the distribution of cars' trap times and cluster sizes. At steady state, the subdiffusive state persists only when there is a large variability in car speeds.

We analyzed chromatin remodeling on next generation sequencing data from resting and activated T cells to determine a whole-genome chromatin remodeling landscape. We consider chromatin remodeling in terms of nucleosome repositioning which can be observed most robustly in long nucleosome-free regions (LNFRs) that are occupied by nucleosomes in another cell state. We found that LNFR sequences are either AT-rich or GC-rich, where nucleosome repositioning was observed much more prominently in GC-rich LNFRs - a considerable proportion of them outside promoter regions. Using support vector machines with string kernels, we identified a GC-rich DNA sequence pattern indicating loci of nucleosome repositioning in resting T cells. This pattern appears to be also typical for CpG islands. We found out that nucleosome repositioning in GC-rich LNFRs is indeed associated with CpG islands and with binding sites of the CpG-island-binding ZF-CXXC proteins KDM2A and CFP1. That this association occurs prominently inside and also prominently outside of promoter regions hints at a mechanism governing nucleosome repositioning that acts on a whole-genome scale.

CD73 has important regulatory functions in the extracellular metabolism of certain nucleoside monophosphates, in particular adenosine monophosphate, and has been linked to a number of pathological conditions such as cancer and myocardial ischaemia. Here, we present the crystal structure of a soluble form of human soluble CD73 (sCD73) at 2.2 angstrom resolution, a truncated form of CD73 that retains ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. With this structure we obtained insight into the dimerisation of CD73, active site architecture, and a sense of secondary modifications of the protein. The crystal structure reveals a conserved loop that is directly involved in the dimer-dimer interaction showing that the two subunits of the dimer are not linked by disulfide bridges. Using biophotonic microarray imaging we were able to confirm glycosylation of the enzyme and show that the enzyme is decorated with a variety of oligosaccharide structures.

Viral polymerases are also known to accept modified substrates, and this has proven crucial in the development of antiviral therapies. However, non-thermostable polymerases of bacterial origin, or engineered variants, that have similar substrate tolerance and could be used for synthetic biology purposes remain to be identified.

We have identified the a subunit of Escherichia coli polymerase III (Pol III a) as a bacterial polymerase that is able to recognise and process as substrates several pyrophosphate-modified dATP analogues in place of its natural substrate dATP for template-directed DNA synthesis. A number of dATP analogues featuring a modified pyrophosphate group were able to serve as substrates during enzymatic DNA synthesis by Pol III a. Features such as the presence of potentially chelating chemical groups and the size and spatial flexibility of the chemical structure seem to be of major importance for the modified leaving group to play its role during the enzymatic reaction. In addition, we could establish that if the pyrophosphate group is altered, deoxynucleotide incorporation proceeds with an efficiency varying with the nature of the nucleobase.

As a method of synthesis, the reduction of gold(III) chloride complex ions using glucose as a reducing agent was carried out.

The optimal conditions inside the microreactor system (concentrations and the flow rate of components) were established as a results of kinetic measurements in the batch reactor. In these studies the rate constants of AuNPs formation (nucleation and growth) as a function of different reductant concentration as well as temperature were determined using UV-Vis spectrophotometry and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method. Experimentally obtained kinetic data gave us the chance to formulate the rate law of AuNPs formation which further was used to establish synthesis conditions.

We speculated that progestin-induced alterations in lipid biology confer resistance to chemotherapy. To examine the biology of lipid loaded breast cancer cells, we used a model of progestin-induced lipid synthesis. T47D (PR-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (PR-negative) cell lines were used to study progestin response. Oil red 0 staining of T47D cells treated with progestin showed lipid droplet formation was PR dependent, glucose dependent and reduced sensitivity to docetaxel. This protection was not observed in PR-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Progestin treatment induced stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) enzyme expression and chemical inhibition of SCD-1 diminished lipid droplets and cell viability, suggesting the importance of lipid stores in cancer cell survival. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis of phospholipids from progestin-treated T47D cells revealed an increase in unsaturated fatty acids, with oleic acid as most abundant. Cells surviving docetaxel treatment also contained more oleic acid in phospholipids, suggesting altered membrane fluidity as a potential mechanism of chemoresistance mediated in part by SCD-1. Lastly, intact docetaxel molecules were present within progestin induced lipid droplets, suggesting a protective quenching effect of intracellular lipid droplets.

This is in contrast to mutations within a heparin-binding TB domain (TB5), which is downstream of the arg-gly-asp cell adhesion domain, which can cause Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) or Acromicric (AD) and Geleophysic Dysplasias (GD). WMS is characterized by short limbs, joint stiffness and ocular defects, whilst fibrillin-1 AD and GD have severe short stature, joint defects and thickened skin. We previously showed that TB5 binds heparin. Here, we show that the corresponding region of fibrillin-2 binds heparin very poorly, highlighting a novel functional difference between the two isoforms. This finding enabled us to map heparin/heparan sulfate binding to two sites on fibrillin-1 TB5 using a mutagenesis approach.

The relationship between specific antibiotic resistant bacteria and the genes they carry remains to be described. Few details are known about the ecology of antibiotic resistant genes and bacteria in food production systems, or how antibiotic resistance genes in food animals compare to antibiotic resistance genes in other ecosystems. Here we report the distribution of antibiotic resistant genes in publicly available agricultural and non-agricultural metagenomic samples and identify which bacteria are likely to be carrying those genes. Antibiotic resistance, as coded for in the genes used in this study, is a process that was associated with all natural, agricultural, and human-impacted ecosystems examined, with between 0.7 to 4.4% of all classified genes in each habitat coding for resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC). Agricultural, human, and coastal-marine metagenomes have characteristic distributions of antibiotic resistance genes, and different bacteria that carry the genes. There is a larger percentage of the total genome associated with antibiotic resistance in gastrointestinal-associated and agricultural metagenomes compared to marine and Antarctic samples. Since antibiotic resistance genes are a natural part of both human-impacted and pristine habitats, presence of these resistance genes in any specific habitat is therefore not sufficient to indicate or determine impact of anthropogenic antibiotic use. We recommend that baseline studies and control samples be taken in order to determine natural background levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria and/or antibiotic resistance genes when investigating the impacts of veterinary use of antibiotics on human health. We raise questions regarding whether the underlying biology of each type of bacteria contributes to the likelihood of transfer via the food chain.

Our previous study demonstrated that TLR9 signaling could enhance the tumor progression of human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We further showed that miR-574-5p was the mostly up-regulated miRNA in human lung cancer cells under TLR9 signaling by miRNA array analysis. Here we characterized the potential role of miRNA-574-5p in enhanced tumor progression induced by TLR9 signaling in human lung cancer. We confirmed that TLR9 signaling effectively elevated the expression of miR-574-5p in human lung cancer cells. Notably, we found that down-regulation of miRNA-5745p using miR-574-5p inhibitor in vitro or miR-574-5p sponge in vivo significantly abrogated the enhanced tumor progression induced by TLR9 signaling. Further studies showed that miR-574-5p was an important player associated with enhanced tumor progression of human lung cancer cells. Notably, we identified checkpoint suppressor 1 (Ches1) as the dominant direct target for miRNA-574-5p to confer the TLR9 signaling enhanced tumor progression. We revealed that overexpression of Ches1 significantly inhibited the cell cycle entry of human lung cancer cells. Finally, we revealed that the expression of miR-574-5p was positively correlated with TLR9 and reversely correlated with Ches1 in lung cancer patients.

We characterize near-cognate suppression of amber, opal and a quadruplet codon in common Escherichia coli laboratory strains and find that the PylRS/tRNAPyl orthogonal pair cannot completely outcompete contamination by natural amino acids.

The most common and severe form of alpha 1ATD is caused by the Z-variant and is characterized by the accumulation of alpha 1AT polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver leading to a severe reduction (>85%) of alpha 1AT in the serum and its anti-protease activity in the lung. In this organ alpha 1AT is critical for ensuring tissue integrity by inhibiting neutrophil elastase, a protease that degrades elastin. Given the limited therapeutic options in alpha 1ATD, a more detailed understanding of the folding and trafficking biology governing alpha 1AT biogenesis and its response to small molecule regulators is required. Herein we report the correction of Z-alpha 1AT secretion in response to treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), acting in part through HDAC7 silencing and involving a calnexin-sensitive mechanism. SAHA-mediated correction restores Z-alpha 1AT secretion and serpin activity to a level 50% that observed for wild-type alpha 1AT. These data suggest that HDAC activity can influence Z-alpha 1AT protein traffic and that SAHA may represent a potential therapeutic approach for alpha 1ATD and other protein misfolding diseases.

In a stochastic hydrodynamic approach for an active gel of finite thickness L, we calculate the mean square displacement of a particle. These particle displacements are governed by fluctuations in the velocity field. We characterize the short-time behavior when the gel is a solid as well as the limit of long times when the gel becomes a fluid and the particle shows simple diffusion. Active stresses together with local polar order give rise to velocity fluctuations that lead to characteristic behaviors of the diffusion coefficient that differ fundamentally from those found in a passive system: the diffusion coefficient can depend on system size and diverges as L approaches an instability threshold. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient becomes independent of the particle size in this case.

To examine how efforts and policies to increase diversity affect the relative representation of women and of minority groups within medicine and related science fields.

Method The authors of this report used data from the Current Population Survey March Supplement (a product of the U. S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics that tracks race, ethnicity, and employment) to compute the representation ratios of persons employed in biology, chemistry, and medicine from 1968 to 2009 (inclusive). They derived the representation ratios by computing the ratio of the conditional probability that a member of a given group is employed in a specific skilled science field to the overall probability of employment in that field. Their analysis tested for differences in representation ratios among racial, gender, and ethnic groups and across time among those employed as biologists, chemists, and medical doctors.

Results Representation ratios rose for white females, whose percentage increase in medicine was larger than for any other racial/ethnic group. The representation ratios fell for Hispanics in biology, chemistry, and medicine. The representation ratio rose for African Americans, whose highest percentage increase occurred in biology. Asian Americans, who had the highest representation ratios in all three disciplines, saw a decline in their relative representation in medicine.

Conclusions The authors have demonstrated that all groups do not benefit equally from diversity initiatives and that competition across related fields can confound efforts to increase diversity in medicine.

Biology of Mucosally Transmitted Sexual Infection-Translating the Basic Science into Novel HIV Intervention: A Workshop Summary","Abstract: A group of over 200 international scientists came together on April 15 in Sydney, Australia just before the 2012 International Microbicides Conference as a part of a workshop to address the basic concepts and factors that modulate HIV infection at the mucosal surface. The meeting focused on defining the interaction between virus, prevailing host physiology, microbiota, and innate and adaptive immune responses and how they combine to impact the outcome at the moment of potential viral transmission. Speakers examined the biology of HIV entry during transmission, innate and natural antiviral mechanisms at the mucosa, microbicide efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics, animal models, and opportunities for combining HIV prevention strategies. Other viral infection models both in vivo and in vitro were considered for the insights they provided into HIV transmission events.

Biology, clinical experience, and future prospects","Abstract: Clinical trials of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus primarily have been directed at the modification of a single major risk factor; however, in trials that enroll patients with and without diabetes, the absolute risk in CVD events remains higher in patients with diabetes. Efforts to reduce the macrovascular and microvascular residual risk have been directed toward a multifactorial CVD risk-factor modification; nonetheless, long-term complications remain high. Dual-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/gamma agonists may offer opportunities to lower macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus beyond the reductions achieved with conventional risk-factor modification. The information presented elucidates the differentiation of compound-specific vs class-effect properties of PPARs as the basis for future development of a new candidate molecule. Prior experience with thiazolidinediones, an approved class of PPAR gamma agonists, and glitazars, investigational class of dual-PPAR alpha/gamma agonists, also provides important lessons about the risks and benefits of targeting a nuclear receptor while revealing some of the future challenges for regulatory approval.

We analyzed records of 767 patients treated at Moffitt Cancer Center between January 2001 and December 2009 to evaluate the relationship between serum albumin (SA) at the time of presentation and overall survival (OS). Patients (median age of 69 years) were stratified into three groups based on SA concentration (=3.5, 3.64.0, and >4.0 g/dL). Two-thirds of the patients had low or intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-based risk for MDS. Median OS by SA concentration of =3.5, 3.64.0, and >4.0 g/dL was 11, 23, and 34 months, respectively (P < 0.005), whereas rate of acute myeloid leukemia progression was highest in patients with low SA (=3.5 g/dL). The SA level offered prognostic discrimination for outcomes within the lower and higher IPSS risk groups, as well as with the MD Anderson risk model. In multivariable analysis, SA was a significant independent co-variate for OS after adjustment for IPSS, age, serum ferritin, and transfusion dependence (hazard ratio = 0.8; 95% CI 0.60.9; P = 0.004). Our findings indicate that hypoalbuminemia is an independent prognostic biomarker that may serve as a surrogate representative of disease biology or comorbidities in patients with MDS. Am. J.

Long-term survival reaching 15% is achieved in less than 5% of patients who undergo surgery, and median survival is only 6 months in those with inoperable lesions. A deeper understanding of PDAC biologic characteristics as well as novel prognostic markers are therefore required to improve outcomes. Herein we report that BAG3, a protein with recognized anti-apoptotic activity, was expressed in 346 PDACs analyzed, but was not expressed in the surrounding nonneoplastic tissue. In a cohort of 66 patients who underwent radical resection (R0), survival was significantly shorter in patients with high BAG3 expression (median, 12 months) than in those with low BAG3 expression (median, 23 months) (P = 0.001). Furthermore, we report that BAG3 expression in PDAC-derived cell lines protects from apoptosis and confers resistance to gemcitabine, offering a partial explanation for the survival data. Our results indicate that BAG3 has a relevant role in PDAC biology, and suggest that BAG3 expression level might be a potential marker for prediction of patient outcome.

The analysis of the B-cell receptor of the malignant cells could contribute to a better understanding of the DLBCL biology. We studied the molecular features of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) rearrangements in 165 patients diagnosed with DLBCL not otherwise specified. Clonal IGH rearrangements were amplified according to the BIOMED-2 protocol and PCR products were sequenced directly. We also analyzed the criteria for stereotyped patterns in all complete IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ (V-D.J) sequences. Complete V-D-J rearrangements were identified in 130 of 165 patients. Most cases (89%) were highly mutated, but 12 sequences were truly unmutated or minimally mutated. Three genes, IGHV4-34, IGHV3-23, and IGHV4-39, accounted for one third of the whole cohort, including an over-representation of IGHV4-34 (15.5% overall). Interestingly, all IGHV4-34 rearrangements and all unmutated sequences belonged to the nongerminal center B-cell like (non-GCB) subtype. Overall, we found three cases following the current criteria for stereotyped heavy chain VH CDR3 sequences, two of them belonging to subsets previously described in CLL.

As an ideal complement to traditional techniques such as chromosome counting, the analysis of cytotype diversity in plant systems such as Sorbus provides primary investigation into the potential patterns and evolutionary implications of hybrid speciation.

Ploidy was assessed by means of relative nuclear DNA content using propidium iodide flow cytometry in 474 Sorbus samples collected from 65 populations in southern Wales and South-West England. Statistical tests were applied to evaluate the utility of this technique to confidently discriminate ploidy in the genus.

Flow cytometric profiles revealed the presence of four cytotypes (2x, 3x, 4x and 5x), confirming in many cases chromosome counts previously reported and demonstrating cytotype heterogeneity within specific Sorbus aggregates. Diploid cytotypes were restricted to the potential parental species and homoploid hybrids. Most of the samples processed were polyploid. The occurrence of the pentaploid cytotype had previously only been reported from a single specimen; it is now confirmed for two taxa occurring at different sites.

Flow cytometry results obtained have proved useful in shedding light on the taxonomy of several controversial taxa and in confirming the presence of cytoypes which occur at very low frequencies. Notably, the coexistence of several cytotypes in Sorbus populations has probably been facilitated by the overlapping distribution of many of the species studied, which might also explain the high incidence of potential hybrid apomictic polyploids. These results will provide a solid baseline for molecular research aiming to better understand the genetic pathways controlling the formation and establishment of polyploid Sorbus.

Data were obtained from trap-nests placed in the field margin during two agricultural years (2008/2009 and 2009/2010). Females made an average of 7.55 cells per nest, and used leaves of at least three plant species to build their nests. Provisions of cells were principally of Asteraceae pollen. Adult emergence showed a bimodal pattern suggesting a facultative bivoltinism life cycle. Approximately, 30 % of all offspring failed to complete development to the adult stage and an additional 10 % were killed by natural enemies. These included parasitic wasps (Eulophidae: Melittobia and Horismenus), a cleptoparasite bee (Megachilidae: Coelioxys), and a bristle beetle (Meloidae: Tetraonyx).

Furthermore, the current invasive-biology paradigm postulates that having a generalist-food habit is key to the successful invasion of a novel community by exotic species. This study investigated how the invasive pike killifish, Belonesox belizanus, has succeeded in establishing exotic populations in Florida, USA despite having a feeding apparatus that is characteristic of a specialized piscivore (i.e., fish-eating fish). Pike killifish collected from their point of introduction in south Florida were (1) filmed using high speed video while feeding on live fish-and shrimp-prey to determine whether prey type affects prey-capture kinematics and then (2) subjected to a prey-selectivity experiment to determine which prey type (live fish or shrimp) the invasive pike killifish eats when both prey are available in the environment. Results indicated that (1) prey-capture kinematics were not affected by prey type, indicating that consumption of fish and shrimp prey was accomplished using a stereotypical feeding repertoire, and (2) pike killifish consumed fish and shrimp when both prey were available in the feeding environment. It is concluded that the invasive pike killifish has the ability to feed on alternative, locally available prey using its piscivorous feeding functional morphology and prey-capture kinematics. This study contributes a new perspective to our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie success of exotic fishes in invaded communities. That is, the ability of a functional-morphological specialist to utilize stereotypical prey-capture kinematics (= behavior) in consuming alternative, locally available prey types (= dietary flexibility) contributes to the establishment of invasive populations. It is evident that these functional specialists are not constrained in their diet, thus, enabling them dietary flexibility and enhancing their invasive potential.

Biology of fowl adenovirus type 1 infection of heterologous cells","Abstract: The JM1/1 strain of fowl adenovirus (FAV) serotype 1 isolated from gizzard erosion was used to investigate the biology of FAV in homologous (susceptible) and heterologous cells. The FAV JM1/1 strain is capable of efficient multiplication in primary chicken kidney (CK) cells, but not in Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells or Vero cells. FAV adsorption in heterologous cells was slightly higher than in CK cells. An early gene encoding a DNA-binding protein and a late gene encoding the hexon protein were expressed in CK cells. Only the early gene was expressed in Vero cells. Neither of these genes was expressed in CRFK cells. These results suggest that the virus was unable to multiply effectively due to suppression of viral gene expression in the heterologous cells used in this study.

The associated parameter estimation problem then requires a prior handling of the global identifiability question in a realistic experimental framework. The lack of a method able to solve this issue has indirectly encouraged the use of global sensitivity analysis to select the subset of parameters to estimate. Nevertheless, the links between these two global analyses are not yet fully explored. The present work reveals new bridges between sensitivity analyses and global non-identifiability, through the use of functions derived from the Sobol' high dimensional representation of the model output.

We proposed using embedded cytokine slow-releasing hydrogels to tune this balance toward a desirable final bone density. In this study we established a systems biology model, and quantitatively explored the combinatorial effects of delivered cytokines from hydrogels on final bone density. We hypothesized that: 1) bone regeneration was driven by transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix, which responded to released cytokines, such as Wnt, BMP2, and TGF beta, drove the development of osteoblast lineage, and contributed to bone mass generation; and 2) the osteoclast lineage, on the other hand, governed the bone resorption, and communications between these two lineages determined the dynamics of bone remodeling. In our model. Intracellular signaling pathways were represented by ordinary differential equations, while the intercellular communications and cellular population dynamics were modeled by stochastic differential equations. Effects of synergistic cytokine combinations were evaluated by Loewe index and Bliss index. Simulation results revealed that the Wnt/BMP2 combinations released from hydrogels showed best control of bone regeneration and synergistic effects, and suggested optimal dose ratios of given cytokine combinations released from hydrogels to most efficiently control the long-term bone remodeling. We revealed the characteristics of cytokine combinations of Wnt/BMP2 which could be used to guide the design of in vivo bone scaffolds and the clinical treatment of some diseases such as osteoporosis.

Here, we report a technique to construct spheroids utilizing 3D culture chips with a rapid and simple method for the replication of the surface structures of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold. The resultant spheroid culture chip made it possible to rapidly yield high numbers of the spheroids at a time as well as to obtain uniform spheroids with a narrow size distribution and to collect the spheroids easily and noninvasively. The most important feature of this spheroid culture chip is that it enables direct oxygen supply to the cells because the chip is made with only gas-permeable PDMS. When human hepatoma HepG2 cells were grown on the oxygen-permeable chips as a model for liver cells, the cellular growth was remarkably enhanced, and the anaerobic glycolysis was significantly reduced compared to the non-oxygen-permeable chips. Furthermore, the oxygen-permeable chip improved the albumin secretion rates compared to the conventional spheroid culture system after 10 days. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that the oxygen-permeable chip dramatically prevented hypoxia in the core of the spheroids and subsequent central necrosis. Surprisingly, the diameters of approximately 400 and 600 mu m were estimated to be the threshold of the hypoxic and survival size, respectively, for the HepG2 spheroids in the oxygenated chip.

Although the cause remains unknown, misfolded protein aggregates are seen in neurons of sporadic ALS patients, and familial ALS mutations, including mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), produce proteins with an increased propensity to misfold and aggregate. A structure activity relationship of a lead scaffold exhibiting neuroprotective activity in a G93A-SOD1 mouse model for ALS has been further investigated in a model PC12 cellular assay. Synthesis of biotinylated probes at the N-1 nitrogen of the pyrazolone ring gave compounds (5d-e) that retained activity within 10-fold of the proton-bearing lead compound (5a) and were equipotent with a sterically less cumbersome N-1-methyl substituted analogue (5b). However, when methyl substitution was introduced at N-1 and N-2 of the pyrazolone ring, the compound was inactive (5c). These data led us to investigate further the pharmacophoric nature of the pyrazolone unit. A range of N-1 substitutions were tolerated, leading to the identification of an N-1-benzyl substituted pyrazolone (5m), equipotent with 5a. Substitution at N-2 or excision of N-2, however, removed all activity. Therefore, the hydrogen bond donating ability of the N-2-H of the pyrazolone ring appears to be a critical part of the structure, which will influence further analogue synthesis.

Complex biological and social networks have displayed presence of some triad motifs far in excess (or short) of their expected values. Some of these over(under)-represented motifs have explained the basic functionality of systems, for example, in the sensory transcription networks of biology, over-represented motifs are shown to perform signal processing tasks. This suggests purposeful, selective retention of these motifs in the studied biological systems. Another interesting feature is the high correlation of triad motif significance profiles (MSPs) of all systems that belong to a family of naturally grouped systems, thereby suggesting that all the systems in a family have the same function to perform and hence the correlation. Engineering systems also display over(under)-represented motifs. The MSPs of a family of naturally grouped engineering systems show high correlation. Unlike biological and social networks, engineering systems are designed by humans and offer an opportunity for investigation based on known design rules. We show that over(under)-represented motifs in engineering systems are not purposefully retained/avoided to perform functions but are a natural consequence of design by decomposition. We also discover that naturally grouped systems have remarkably correlated in(out) degree distribution across nodes resulting in a high correlation in MSP. Therefore, we argue that the idea of network motifs has no significance in engineering systems (unlike biological and other evolutionary systems), and we caution the engineering research community to be careful while drawing conclusions based on network motifs. We report a remarkable correlation of in(out) degree distribution of systems within a family of engineering systems. We further show that biological and social networks also display signs of decomposition. They also show a high correlation of inout degree distribution of nodes for systems within a family. This opens up an interesting opportunity to investigate these systems through their observed decomposition. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Despite this, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that might account for this relationship remain incompletely understood. A key challenge has been in distinguishing between a whole-body milieu of inflammation and oxidative stress from the ramifications of cell-specific resistance to insulin. Transgenic models have now begun to explore the cellular influences of insulin resistance on vascular biology, with novel implications for atherosclerosis across a range of cells including endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages and fibroblasts. Emerging data from these models have also begun to challenge conventional dogma. In particular, the findings across various cell types are disparate with some even implying a protective influence on vascular biology. We now review these data, highlighting recent advances in our understanding of cellular resistance to insulin as well as those areas where there remains a paucity of data.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the first 544 clinically significant isolates revealed high prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SXT) (30.7%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of 165 TMP-SXT-resistant isolates revealed a heterogeneous population. Multilocus sequence typing 'identified 7 STs from 9 identified PFGE clusters, which included separate PFGE clusters of fluoroquinolorie-resistant and -susceptible ST131 isolates. The majority of TMP-SXT resistant isolates (85.5%) were found to carry class 1 integrons, and plasmids from 62 (81%) of 77 representative isolates were successfully transformed into E. coil DH10B. Overall, ampicillin was the most common plasmid-encoded resistance phenotype transferred with TMP-SXT at 60% (37/62). Further characterization of 52 plasmids by restriction fragment length polymorphism and replicon typing revealed the presence of many plasmid lineages, suggesting that the elevated rates of TMP-SXT resistance in these communities are most likely attributed to the horizontal transfer of class 1 integrons. Results from this study emphasize the importance of continued surveillance of remote northern communities in order to optimize the efficacy of empiric UTI treatment.

Lifestyles of the pathogens extend from biotrophy to necrotrophy, obligate to facultative pathogenesis, and narrow to broad host ranges on plants or animals. Sequencing of several pathogens has revealed striking variation in genome size and content, a plastic set of genes related to pathogenesis, and adaptations associated with obligate biotrophy. Features of genome evolution include repeat-driven expansions, deletions, gene fusions, and horizontal gene transfer in a landscape organized into gene-dense and gene-sparse sectors and influenced by transposable elements. Gene expression profiles are also highly dynamic throughout oomycete life cycles, with transcriptional polymorphisms as well as differences in protein sequence contributing to variation. The genome projects have set the foundation for functional studies and should spur the sequencing of additional species, including more diverse pathogens and nonpathogens.

Despite significant progress in the understanding, the mechanisms and pathophysiology of AF treatments are often unsatisfactory. This in part may be related to the complexity of this arrhythmia, as well as its evolution overtime. Atrial fibrillation has many aetiologies and underlying causes. The anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) and interventions aimed at controlling AF should therefore be based on aetiology and associated conditions, rather than electrophysiological mechanisms. The current guideline in the management of AF in most part is based on safety and outcome. This review will discuss the approach to management, based on primary prevention of AF with the aim to target at risk factors, triggers, specific substrates related to aetiology rather than mechanisms. The development of new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies should consider not only evidence based, but also include patient-specific personalized context system biology and pharmacology; otherwise, we will continue to see moderate drug efficacy at best and negative results and outcomes.

Lunules are paired cup-like suckers that assist in securing attachment of the copepod parasite to its host. Although present in genera such as Caligus and Pseudocaligus, lunules are absent in other caligid genera such as Lepeophtheirus as well as in more primitive caligiforms such as members of the families Trebiidae and Dissonidae. We compared the morphology and development of the anterior margin of the frontal plates between two caligids, Pseudocaligus fugu and Lepeophtheirus sekii, and a more basal caligiform, Dissonus heronensis (a dissonid), using scanning electron, transmission electron, and laser confocal microscopes. Our observations suggest that the lunules originated as a modification of the marginal membranes of the ancestral frontal plates. We also demonstrated the presence of an anlagen cell population for the lunule and marginal membrane in the developing frontal plate. These primordial cells can be detected as early as the first stage of the chalimus phase. Based on these observations, an evolutionary scenario for the lunule is proposed based on cytological evidence. This case study enhances our understanding of evolutionary novelty, which is a main focus of contemporary evolutionary developmental biology.

In C57Bl/6 mice engineered to overexpress caveolin specifically in cardiac myocytes (Cav-3 OE), localization of caveolin to mitochondria increases membrane rigidity (4.2%; P<0.05), tolerance to calcium, and respiratory function (72% increase in state 3 and 23% increase in complex IV activity; P<0.05), while reducing stress-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (by 20% in cellular superoxide and 41 and 28% in mitochondrial superoxide under states 4 and 3, respectively; P<0.05) in Cav-3 OE vs. TGneg. By contrast, mitochondrial function is abnormal in caveolin-knockout mice and Caenorhabditis elegans with null mutations in caveolin (60% increase free radical in Cav-2 C. elegans mutants; P<0.05). In human colon cancer cells, mitochondria with increased caveolin have a 30% decrease in apoptotic stress (P<0.05), but cells with disrupted mitochondria-caveolin interaction have a 30% increase in stress response (P<0.05). Targeted gene transfer of caveolin to mitochondria in C57Bl/6 mice increases cardiac mitochondria tolerance to calcium, enhances respiratory function (increases of 90% state 4, 220% state 3, 88% complex IV activity; P<0.05), and decreases (by 33%) cardiac damage (P<0.05).

Here, we review translocation projects, both published and unpublished. Our results indicate that most projects (1) addressed fewer than half of the basic criteria established for translocations and (2) were either unjustifiable from a conservation perspective or inadequately designed to guarantee success or preclude negative consequences. We propose a hierarchical decision-making system - an explicit method that integrates existing guidelines, thereby covering a key gap in conservation science - to reduce ambiguity when deciding whether to implement a given translocation project. This method will improve the likelihood of success in translocation projects and contribute to the efficient use of the limited resources available for these conservation efforts.

In mammals, melatonin is the key hormonal relay for the photoperiodic message, governing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary stalk. TSH acts on neighbouring hypothalamic cells known as tanycytes, which in turn control hypothalamic function through effects on thyroid hormone (TH) signalling, mediated by changes in expression of the type II and III deiodinases (Dio2 and Dio3, respectively). Among seasonally breeding rodents, voles of the genus Microtus are notable for a high degree of sensitivity to nutritional and social cues, which act in concert with photoperiod to control reproductive status. In the present study, we investigated whether the TSH/Dio2/Dio3 signalling pathway of female common voles (Microtus arvalis) shows a similar degree of photoperiodic sensitivity to that described in other seasonal mammal species. Additionally, we sought to determine whether the plant metabolite 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (6-MBOA), described previously as promoting reproductive activation in voles, had any influence on the TSH/Dio2/Dio3 system. Our data demonstrate a high degree of photoperiodic sensitivity in this species, with no observable effects of 6-MBOA on upstream pituitary/hypothalamic gene expression. Further studies are required to characterise how photoperiodic and nutritional signals interact to modulate hypothalamic TH signalling pathways in mammals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Biology of PIWI-interacting RNAs: new insights into biogenesis and function inside and outside of germlines","Abstract: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that act as guardians of the genome, protecting it from invasive transposable elements in the germline. Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells. Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms. The purpose of this review is to highlight new piRNA factors and novel insights in the piRNA world.

Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in endometrial cancer, they have primarily focused on a small set of known cancer genes and have thus provided a limited view of the molecular basis underlying this disease. Here we have developed an integrated systems-biology approach to identifying novel cancer genes contributing to endometrial tumorigenesis. We first performed whole-exome sequencing on 13 endometrial cancers and matched normal samples, systematically identifying somatic alterations with high precision and sensitivity. We then combined bioinformatics prioritization with high-throughput screening (including both shRNA-mediated knockdown and expression of wild-type and mutant constructs) in a highly sensitive cell viability assay. Our results revealed 12 potential driver cancer genes including 10 tumor-suppressor candidates (ARID1A, INHBA, KMO, TTLL5, GRM8, IGFBP3, AKTIP, PHKA2, TRPS1, and WNT11) and two oncogene candidates (ERBB3 and RPS6KC1). The results in the ""sensor"" cell line were recapitulated by siRNA-mediated knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines. Focusing on ARID1A, we integrated mutation profiles with functional proteomics in 222 endometrial cancer samples, demonstrating that ARID1A mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and are associated with PI3K pathway activation. siRNA knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines increased AKT phosphorylation supporting ARID1A as a novel regulator of PI3K pathway activity. Our study presents the first unbiased view of somatic coding mutations in endometrial cancer and provides functional evidence for diverse driver genes and mutations in this disease.

We identify 2489 putative melanocyte enhancer loci in the mouse genome by ChIP-seq for EP300 and H3K4me1. We demonstrate that these putative enhancers are evolutionarily constrained, enriched for sequence motifs predicted to bind key melanocyte transcription factors, located near genes relevant to melanocyte biology, and capable of driving reporter gene expression in melanocytes in culture (86%; 43/50) and in transgenic zebrafish (70%; 7/10). Next, using the sequences of these putative enhancers as a training set for a supervised machine learning algorithm, we develop a vocabulary of 6-mers predictive of melanocyte enhancer function. Lastly, we demonstrate that this vocabulary has genome-wide predictive power in both the mouse and human genomes. This study provides deep insight into the regulation of gene expression in melanocytes and demonstrates a powerful approach to the investigation of regulatory sequences that can be applied to other cell types.

Increases in average life span in the last century are the result of improved public health measures, and many diseases may be related to lifestyle choices. But animal research has contributed to understanding these factors and to the development of vaccines and lifesaving treatments.

The observed lengths at 50 % maturity were approximately 170 mm in standard length (SL) for females and 160 mm SL for males, which corresponded approximately to 3-year-old fish. The spawning season was estimated to take place from January to May, peaking from February to April, which closely coincided with the coldest water temperatures of the year. The lipidosomatic index of both sexes decreased from January onward and maintained low values until July, presumably as the fish expended energy to reproduce. Spawning intervals were estimated to occur between 1.3 and 1.8 days from February to April. Fecundity (F) for females tested using 69 ovaries was related to SL: F = 1.313 x 10(-4) x SL3.966. Histological observations and a fish market survey suggested that the species spawned in sandy muddy areas (< 20 m) based on the presence of mature individuals.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether Epo is detectable in the ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian tumors.

Patients and Methods: We investigated the presence of Epo in the ascitic fluid of 100 women undergoing laparotomy for an ovarian tumor. Epo concentration was quantitated with an immunochemiluminometric assay.

Results: Ten women had a benign tumor, 13 women had a borderline tumor, and 77 women had ovarian cancer. Epo was detected in all ascitic fluid samples, in similar amounts as in corresponding serum samples. Ascitic fluid Epo concentration did not differ between the 3 study groups (P = 0.081), but in multiple comparisons, ascitic fluid Epo was higher in the women with cancer than in the women with a benign tumor (P = 0.006). Ascitic fluid Epo concentration correlated positively with serum Epo (P < 0.0001) and the volume of ascites (P < 0.0001). In regression analyses, serum Epo, volume of ascites, blood hemoglobin, plasma CA125, tumor stage, tumor grade, and the presence of residual tumor after surgery had no significant independent effect on ascitic fluid Epo.

Conclusion: Considerable amounts of Epo are present in the ascitic fluid of women with ovarian tumors. The origin of Epo in the ascitic fluid of women with ovarian tumors as well as the clinical relevance of our finding remain to be clarified.

However, nonmolecular synapomorphies are unclear, and more comparative data are needed to elucidate deep relationships within the order. In this article, pollen and tapetum characters are reevaluated in relation to recent hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships within clusioids. This is done to shed light on the evolution of pollen and tapetum, particularly the evolution of pollen dyads, and also to assess the potential utility of pollen and tapetal characters in the systematics of the clusioids. The comparative morphology of pollen and tapetum is examined in selected taxa from Bonnetiaceae (Bonnetia), Calophylaceae (Caraipa), Clusiaceae (Clusia, Garcinia), Hypericaceae (Hypericum), and Podostemaceae (Podostemum). Pollen and tapetum characters in clusioids and selected outgroups are tabulated, based on both original observations and an extensive literature search, and then optimized onto a recent molecular phylogeny. The optimizations indicate that unusual pollen dispersed as dyads has evolved from monads in the late-branching Podostemoideae (Podostemaceae) clade. Relatively small-sized pollen (E = 11-30 mu m) is a potential synapomorphy for Hypericaceae and Podostemaceae, supporting the putative sister relationship between these two families, and pollen with circular or elliptic endoapertures is a potential synapomorphy for Bonnetiaceae. Several pollen characters (size, shape, apertures, and sculpture) indicate that Weddellina (Weddellinoideae: Podostemaceae) is more closely related to Hypericaceae than are Tristichoideae. Irregular granular exines have arisen several times independently within clusioids. A high level of polymorphism occurs in pollen characters in Clusiaceae and is probably related to high levels of diversity in floral morphology, pollination mechanisms, and pollinators, particularly in Clusia and Garcinia. By contrast, pollen of Podostemoideae is relatively uniform, despite developmental differences in microsporogenesis type and the presence of dyads. This may reflect evolutionary canalization or convergent evolution in these enigmatic aquatic plants.

However, there is little peer-reviewed data available regarding the biological differences between fallback pigs and their normal cohorts. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to identify differences in the biology and physiology, and thus the growth and metabolism, between pigs with varying weaning weights (WW) and postweaning performance. To accomplish this objective, a total of 120 barrows (PIC C22/C29 x 337) were used in growth and comparative slaughter experiments. Pigs were selected from a population of 960 weanling pigs to represent the 10% lightest, median, and heaviest pigs at weaning (n = 40 pigs per WW category). Eight pigs from each WW category were harvested on d 5 postweaning as the initial slaughter group (ISG). The remaining 96 barrows were housed in individual crates, fed ad libitum quantities of a common diet during a 27-d growth study, and were harvested on d 33 or 34 postweaning. After the completion of the live animal component of the experiment, pigs within each WW category were further stratified into the slowest, median, or fastest 33% ADG categories. This resulted in a total of 9 treatments in a nested design. Fallback pigs were designated as those belonging to the slowest ADG category from either the lightest or median WW categories. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS with the fixed effects of WW category and WW(ADG). Although feed intake was maximized (P < 0.0001) by WW(ADG) category, feed efficiency was not different (P = 0.30). When equalized per unit of BW, WW(ADG) category greatly affected (P < 0.02) eviscerated carcass, organ, and metabolic BW, but not (P = 0.28) empty BW. There were no differences (P > 0.12) in tissue nutrient concentrations, ratios, or energy content among pigs in the growth experiment. All tissue deposition rates, which were calculated as the difference between tissue nutrient concentrations of the growth experiment and initial slaughter groups, were maximized (P < 0.0002) by WW(ADG), even when equalized per unit of BW. In conclusion, WW and ADG affect tissue accretion rates, but not feed efficiency or carcass composition in nursery pigs.

This property arises from the epithelial-like tight junctions within the brain capillary endothelium. The BBB is anatomically and functionally distinct from the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier at the choroid plexus. Certain small molecule drugs may cross the BBB via lipid-mediated free diffusion, providing the drug has a molecular weight <400 Da and forms <8 hydrogen bonds. These chemical properties are lacking in the majority of small molecule drugs, and all large molecule drugs. Nevertheless, drugs can be reengineered for BBB transport, based on the knowledge of the endogenous transport systems within the BBB. Small molecule drugs can be synthesized that access carrier-mediated transport (CMT) systems within the BBB. Large molecule drugs can be reengineered with molecular Trojan horse delivery systems to access receptor-mediated transport (RMT) systems within the BBB. Peptide and antisense radiopharmaceuticals are made brain-penetrating with the combined use of RMT-based delivery systems and avidin-biotin technology.

At day 3 postischemia, alpha SMA+ cells were concentrated in two main loci within the ipsilateral hemisphere (Area A) in the medial corpus callosum and (Area B) midway through the striatum adjacent to the lateral ventricle. By day 7 and further by day 14, fewer alpha SMA+ cells remained in Areas A and B but a steady increase in the pen-infarct was observed. alpha SMA+ cells also expressed glial acidic fibrillary protein [GFAP: alpha SMA+/GFAP+ (29%); alpha SMA+/GFAP- (71%) phenotypes] and feline leukemia virus C receptor 2 (FLVCR2), but not ED1(microglia) and established markers of pericytes normally located in vascular wall. alpha SMA+ cells were also located close to the subventricular zones (SVZ) adjacent to Areas A and B. In conclusion, alpha SMA+ cells have been identified in a spatial and temporal sequence from the SVZ, at intermediate loci and in the vicinity of the pen-infarct. It is hypothesized that novel populations of alpha SMA+ precursors of pericytes are born on the SVZ, migrate into the pen-infarct region and are incorporated into new vessels of the pen-infarct regions.

In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, TLR7 ligation vigorously accelerated tumor progression and induced loss of expression of PTEN, p16, and cyclin D1 and upregulation of p21, p27, p53, c-Myc, SHPTP1, TGF-beta, PPAR gamma, and cyclin B1. Furthermore, TLR7 ligation induced STAT3 activation and interfaced with Notch as well as canonical NF-kappa B and MAP kinase pathways, but downregulated expression of Notch target genes. Moreover, blockade of TLR7 protected against carcinogenesis. Since pancreatic tumorigenesis requires stromal expansion, we proposed that TLR7 ligation modulates pancreatic cancer by driving stromal inflammation. Accordingly, we found that mice lacking TLR7 exclusively within their inflammatory cells were protected from neoplasia. These data suggest that targeting TLR7 holds promise for treatment of human pancreatic cancer.

The innate immune proteins in the yolk of embryos are of maternal origin. Maternal stress affects the maternal-to-embryo transfer of these proteins and, therefore, environmental stressors may change the course of embryo development, including embryonic immunocompetency, via their deleterious effect on maternal physiology. This review focuses on the associations that exist between maternal stress, maternal endocrine disturbance and the responses of the acellular innate immune proteins of early-stage fish embryos. Early-stage teleostean embryos are dependent upon the adult female for the formation of the zona pellucida as an essential barrier defence, for their supply of nutrients, and for the innate immunity proteins and antibodies that are transferred from the maternal circulation to the oocytes; maternally derived hormones are also transferred, some of which (such as cortisol) are known to exert a suppressive action on some aspects of the immune defences. This review summarizes what is known about the effects of oocyte cortisol content on the immune system components in early embryos. The review also examines recent evidence that embryonic cells during early cleavage have the capacity to respond to increased maternal cortisol transfer; this emphasizes the importance of maternal and early immune competence on the later life of fishes, both in the wild and in intensive culture.

Oxidative stress biomarkers and EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, Cyp1A enzyme) activity were used as indicators of possible environmental stress and stable isotopes as determinants of diet and trophic position. Latvian S. salar stocks Daugava and Gauja had distinct stable-isotope signatures compared to the other stocks, indicating differences in migration patterns, residency or arrival times, or dietary specialization among stocks. Salmo salar originating from Daugava and Gauja also had lower catalase enzyme activity than the other stocks. Post-smolts originating from rivers of the Gulf of Finland had elevated EROD activities compared to fish of the same age from Bothnian Bay rivers, which could indicate exposure to organochlorine pollutants. No other stock-specific differences in oxidative stress biomarkers were found. The study demonstrates how genetic, oxidative stress biomarker, EROD and stable-isotope data may be combined to study trophic position, prey prevalence and environmental stress of mixed S. salar stocks foraging in the sea.

Maturity and reproductive status were assessed from histological sections of ovaries (n = 234) and testes (n = 243) of fish caught in commercial longline and recreational fisheries between 2006 and 2009. Spawning peaked in the Coral Sea during November and December at sea surface temperatures between 24.8 and 28.3 degrees C. Lower jaw fork length (L-LJF) at 50% maturity (L-LJF50), a key variable for stock assessment, was estimated to be 2100 +/- 102 mm (mean + s.e.) for females and 1668 +/- 18 mm for males. Unlike large pelagic tunas Thunnus spp., the proportion of females increased with length and spawning fish formed multiple large-scale aggregations within a broad latitudinal band. This study provides a starting point for biological parameters needed for stock assessment and conservation of K. audax and introduces the multiple aggregation spawning concept as a reproductive mechanism to explain genetic heterogeneity observed in some highly migratory species.

On the basis of previous studies of A. nobilis sound production relative to periods of known spawning activity, LARS were set to continuously record ambient sounds for a 2 h period around sunset from April to June 2009. Acoustic analyses identified A. nobilis courtship sounds on 89, 28 and 45% of the days at the three locations, respectively. From 474 h of acoustic data, spawning-related sounds (chants) were detected on 19 occasions in 2009 with an additional 11 spawning chants recorded during a 2007 validation period. Most spawning chants occurred within 30 min of sunset during the months of May and June at a mean +/- S.D. surface temperature of 18.2 +/- 1.2 degrees C. Consecutive daily spawning activity was not apparent at any sites in 2009. Atractoscion nobilis spawning chants were recorded at all three sites, suggesting that shallow rocky reefs which support kelp forests provide suitable A. nobilis spawning habitat. Results confirm the utility of passive acoustic recorders for identifying A. nobilis spawning periods and locations.

The anadromous status of the parental fish was confirmed using strontium isotopic analysis of otoliths. Whilst manganese concentrations in eggs varied over time, concentrations of aluminium, potassium, magnesium, strontium, barium and calcium were all unchanged 1 week and 6 weeks post-fertilization as well as in recently hatched larvae. The results clearly suggest that the distinctive trace element signature present in the eggs and newly hatched larvae of anadromous S. trutta (typically characterized by high strontium, low barium) is stable over time. Therefore analysis of the trace element composition of eggs is concluded to be a cost-effective and reliable method for determining the spatial and temporal extent of upstream spawning migration by anadromous salmonids. The temporal variability of at least one element in this study suggests the stability of untested multi-element signatures cannot automatically be assumed.

The results confirmed the existence of compensatory growth in R. caspicus which depended on the duration of food deprivation. Complete compensatory growth occurred in the fish that were food deprived for at least 3 weeks. Starvation and re-feeding had no significant effect on the digestive somatic index and intestinal surface areas in the fish that were food deprived for 1 week, while they showed a significant decrease and increase, during starvation and re-feeding in the fish that were food deprived for 2 and 3 weeks. This knowledge may have application in aquaculture, as appropriate exploitation of compensatory growth can give increased growth rate and feeding efficiency.

Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inferences did not correspond with any taxonomic scheme proposed to date. Rather, although L. richardsoni (from Alaska to California) and L. ayresii (from British Columbia to California) together constituted a well-supported clade distinct from several genetically divergent Lampetra populations in Oregon and California, these two species were not reciprocally monophyletic. The genetically divergent populations included L. pacifica (from the Columbia River basin) and L. hubbsi (from the Kern River basin) and four Lampetra sp. populations in Oregon (Siuslaw River and Fourmile Creek) and California (Kelsey and Mark West Creeks). These four Lampetra sp. populations showed genetic divergence between 2.3 and 5.7% from any known species (and up to 8.0% from each other), and may represent morphologically cryptic and thus previously undescribed species. A fifth population (from Paynes Creek, California) may represent a range extension of L. hubbsi into the Upper Sacramento River.

The species has been introduced into these systems, expanding its range, and is presumably well adapted to freshwater Iberian Peninsula ecosystems. The results show a consistent pattern for size of lateral fins, with L. gibbosus that inhabit streams in the Iberian Peninsula having longer lateral fins than those inhabiting reservoirs or lakes. Differences in fin placement, body depth and caudal peduncle dimensions do not differentiate populations of L. gibbosus from lentic and lotic water bodies and, therefore, are not consistent with functional expectations. Lepomis gibbosus from lotic and lentic habitats also do not show a consistent pattern of internal morphological differentiation, probably due to the lack of loticlentic differences in prey type. Overall, the univariate and multivariate analyses show that most of the external and internal morphological characters that vary among populations do not differentiate lotic from lentic Iberian populations. The lack of expected differences may be a consequence of the high seasonal flow variation in Mediterranean streams, and the resultant low- or no-flow conditions during periods of summer drought.

Using data for the top 10% of values and a randomization procedure, the maximum total length (L-T) and mass of each species and the maximum age of the first two species were estimated to be significantly greater off Perth than in the JBMP (all P < 0.001) and the maximum ages of O. lineolata in the two localities did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). These latitudinal trends, thus, typically conform to those frequently exhibited by fish species and the predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). While, in terms of mass, the instantaneous growth rates of each species were similar at both latitudes during early life, they were greater at the higher latitude throughout the remainder and thus much of life, which is broadly consistent with the MTE. When expressed in terms of L-T, however, instantaneous growth rates did not exhibit consistent latitudinal trends across all three species. The above trends with mass, together with those for reproductive variables, demonstrate that a greater amount of energy is directed into somatic growth and gonadal development by each of these species at the higher latitude. The consistency of the direction of the latitudinal trends for maximum body size and age and pattern of growth across all three species implies that each species is responding in a similar manner to differences between the environmental characteristics, such as temperature, at those two latitudes. The individual maximum L-T, mass and age and pattern of growth of O. lineolata at a higher and thus cooler latitude on the eastern Australian coast are consistent with the latitudinal trends exhibited by those characteristics for this species in the two western Australian localities. The implications of using mass rather than length as the indicator variable when comparing the maximum sizes of the three species and the trends exhibited by the instantaneous growth rates of those species at different latitudes are explored. Although growth curves fitted to both the L-T and masses at age for the males of each species lay above those for their females, this would not have influenced the conclusions drawn from common curves for both sexes.

The genetic variation of all remaining populations of the species was analysed using both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers and their habitat conditions were assessed using a water quality index (I-WQ). An 80% local extinction was found across the distribution of N. bilineata. The species was found in three of the 16 historical localities plus one previously unreported site. Most areas inhabited by the remaining populations had I-WQ scores unsuitable for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity. Populations showed low but significant genetic differentiation with both markers (mtDNA phi(ST) = 0.076, P < 0.001; microsatellite F-ST = 0.314, P < 0.001). Borbollon, in the Cuitzeo Basin, showed the highest level of differentiation and was identified as a single genetic unit by Bayesian assignment methods. Rio Grande de Morelia and Salamanca populations showed the highest genetic diversity and also a high migration rate facilitated by an artificial channel that connected the two basins. Overall, high genetic diversity values were observed compared with other freshwater fishes (average N-a = 16 alleles and loci and mean +/- S.D. H-o = 0.63 +/- 0.10 and nucleotide diversity pi = 0.006). This suggests that the observed genetic diversity has not diminished as rapidly as the species' habitat destruction. No evidence of correlation between habitat conditions and genetic diversity was found. The current pattern of genetic diversity may be the result of both historical factors and recent modifications of the hydrological system. The main threat to the species may be the rapid habitat deterioration and associated demographic stochasticity rather than genetic factors.

The vertebral cartilage develops in the following sequence: basidorsals and basiventrals, neural canals, neural spines and ribs. The development of ribs remained incomplete in the largest specimen (181 dph, 179 mm L-T) that was examined. Endoskeletal development of the fins began 4 dph for the dorsal and anal fins, 6 dph for the pectoral fin and 10 dph for the caudal and pelvic fins. Complete elements of all fins were observed by 91 dph and complete ossification of fin rays was observed by 122 dph in the double-stained specimens. Observation of the histological sections, however, suggested that ossification occurred soon after the formation of the organic matrix in the fin rays. Dorsal scutes were first visible by 25 dph, followed by the lateral and ventral scutes, which were visible by 37 and 44 dph, respectively. The number of scutes was fixed at 44, 59 and 91 dph and ossification was complete by 59 (dorsal) and 91 dph (lateral and ventral scutes) in the double-stained specimens. Ossification occurred soon after the formation of the scute organic matrix in the histological sections. Four types of scales were observed in the H. huso x A. ruthenus hybrid. Median predorsal, preanal and small scales on the anterior section of the head were visible by 59 dph. Scales on the caudal fin were visible by 91 dph and a variable assemblage of scales anterior to the anal fin was visible by 122 dph. Both the scutes and scales developed in a process that is similar to that of intramembranous ossification.

Fish biomass trophic guild compositions and biomass trophic spectrum profiles were analysed using multivariate statistical techniques and included both inter-regional (zoogeographic) and intra-regional (estuarine typology) comparisons. Differences in the fish trophic structure of the various estuary types within each zoogeographic region were observed; these were linked to the relative biomass contribution of the various trophic guilds and also to differences in biomass trophic spectrum profiles of the fishes in each estuary type within each region. In spite of these differences in trophic structure, all estuaries were dominated by detritivores, which suggests that the main food source (detritus) is similar in all biogeographic regions. Preliminary indications are that a similar dependence by estuary-associated fishes on detritus food sources exists on a global basis but that detailed studies are required in order to confirm this assertion.

A variety of personal lubricants and condoms were tested to determine the frequency of the false positive, as well as its potential source. Samples were extracted in both water and the manufacturer-provided buffer, and the test was performed according to the manufacturers suggested protocol. The false positive was observed intermittently, but occurred consistently with samples containing nonoxynol-9, a strong detergent utilized as a spermicide. The reaction may be attributable to the combination of latex and nonoxynol-9. Because of the unreliability of the test to confirm the presence of PSA in samples collected from condoms, the PSA cassette is an unsuitable method for confirming the presence of seminal fluid in condoms.

In particular, interactions between murid herpesvirus 4 and Mus musculus (a non-natural host species) have been extensively studied under controlled laboratory conditions. However, several fundamental aspects of murine gammaherpesvirus biology are not well understood, including how these viruses are transmitted from host to host, and their impacts on host fitness under natural conditions. Here, we investigate the epidemiology of a gammaherpesvirus in free-living wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in a 2-year longitudinal study. Wood mouse herpesvirus (WMHV) was the only herpesvirus detected and occurred frequently in wood mice and also less commonly in bank voles. Strikingly, WMHV infection probability was highest in reproductively active, heavy male mice. Infection risk also showed a repeatable seasonal pattern, peaking in spring and declining through the summer. We show that this seasonal decline can be at least partly attributed to reduced recapture of WMHV-infected adults. These results suggest that male reproductive behaviours could provide an important natural route of transmission for these viruses. They also suggest that gammaherpesvirus infection may have significant detrimental effects in wild hosts, questioning the view that these viruses have limited impacts in natural, co-evolved host species.

Here we investigate the consequences of multiple mating on fertility of Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni) females sequentially mated to irradiated ('sterile') and unirradiated ('normal') males. Females mated by two normal males showed persistent high fertility whereas females mated by two sterile males showed persistent low fertility. Despite lack of association between copula duration and sperm number, fertility of females mated to a normal and then a sterile male increased with duration of the first copulation and decreased with duration of the second. Fertility of females mated to a sterile male and then a normal male was not influenced by duration of the first copulation but increased with duration of the second. These findings reveal a need for increased attention to how factors other than sperm number influence post-copulatory sexual selection in tephritid flies, and in particular how copula duration is linked to sperm storage and usage.

Here we have studied the preferential body temperature (T-p) and its consequences on immune response performance after an immune challenge in larvae of Tenebrio molitor. We evaluated T-p and immune responses of larvae following a challenge with various concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and we studied the correlation between T-p and two immune traits, namely antibacterial and phenoloxidase (PO) activities. Larvae that were immune challenged with higher LPS concentrations (C-50 and C-100) preferred in average, warmer temperatures than did larvae challenged with lower concentrations (C-0 and C-25). T-p of C-25-C-100 (challenged)-mealworms was 2.3 degrees C higher than of C-0 (control) larvae. At lower LPS concentration immune challenge (C-0 and C-25) antibacterial activity correlated positively with T. but at C-50 and C-100 correlation was lose. PO activity was higher at higher LPS concentration, but its magnitude of response did not correlate with T-p Our data suggest that behavioural fever may have a positive effect on host performance by enhancing antibacterial response under a low pathogen load situation.

However, we and others have reported that cancer patients have a reduction in both NKT cell number and function. NKT cells can be stimulated and expanded with alpha-GalCer and cytokines and these expanded NKT cells retain their phenotype, remain responsive to antigenic stimulation, and display cytotoxic function against tumor cell lines. These data strongly favor the use of ex vivo expanded NKT cells in adoptive immunotherapy. NKT cell based-immunotherapy has been limited by the use of autologous antigen-presenting cells, which can vary substantially in their quantity and quality. A standardized system that relies on artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) could produce the stimulating effects of dendritic cell (DC) without the pitfalls of allo- or xenogeneic cells. In this review, we discuss the progress that has been made using CD1d-based aAPC and how this acellular antigen presenting system can be used in the future to enhance our understanding of NKT cell biology and to develop NKT cell-specific adoptive immunotherapeutic strategies.

It considers those factors in particular that impact on the overall health and survival of individuals as well as populations. Methods for the discrimination of the species are reviewed as well as the approaches being taken to delineate different populations, which is crucial to appropriately manage individual fisheries. Cockle populations generally undergo sexual maturation during their second summer and sexes are separate. Eggs are pelagic, with larvae being both benthic and pelagic before settling on the sediment and becoming benthic adults. However, data are lacking on basic larval biology and dispersal mechanisms. Data are provided on predator-prey relationships including information on types of food of importance to cockles. Main predators of cockles include brown shrimp, shore crabs, gastropods, polychaetes, fish and a variety of birds and these can be important in structuring cockle populations. Predation of larval cockles by adult cockles through larviphagy can lead to reductions of up to 40% of the population. Cockles are sensitive to a wide range of chemical contaminants but few data are published on impacts on cockles, in particular larval stages. The review concludes with an assessment of future climate change scenarios on cockles and considers some areas of future research required to preserve this ecologically and economically important species.

The effects of body size and declining oxygen tension on oxygen uptake in gastropods,"Abstract: Metabolic rate is one of the most frequently measured physiological variables and the relationship between oxygen uptake and body mass is one of the most controversial issues in biology. The present study used closed chamber respirometry to compare the oxygen uptake of 32 species of benthic British gastropod molluscs of a wide size-range (from less than 0.001 g to greater than to g dry tissue weight). We investigated the effects of body size on the respiratory rate at 10 degrees C to explore the evolutionary and phylogenetically determined patterns of metabolic scaling both among different gastropods groups, and within siphonate and asiphonate caenogastropods. Resting oxygen uptake ((V)over dotO(2)) increased with body mass (W) with a slope value of 0.6 using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and standard major axis (SMA) where N = 488, over a 6 fold range of body mass. The slopes b of the regression lines relating oxygen uptake to body mass were similar for all heterobranch molluscs and most caenogastropods. Highest mass-specific rates for oxygen consumption were found for the smallest littorinid species. Trophic mode significantly affected the amount of oxygen consumed with higher oxygen uptake in herbivores than other groups, including detritivores and predators. All of the gastropods reduced their oxygen consumption when exposed to declining oxygen conditions; however, about a third of the species exhibited partial regulation at higher oxygen partial pressures. When exposed to 20% normal saturation levels, smaller gastropods respired at approximately 25% of their rates in fully saturated seawater whereas larger species (above 0.1 g dry tissue weight) respired at approximately 35% of the values recorded at full saturation. Our study suggests that a scaling exponent relating O-2 to body mass of 0.6 is typical and may be 'universal' for gastropods. It is below the 0.75 scaling exponent which has been proposed for ectothermic invertebrates. It is concluded that size does matter in determining the metabolic patterns of gastropods and that the quantity of oxygen consumed and the energy balance of gastropods is affected by activity, food type and exposure to declining oxygen conditions.

Analysis of renal biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis revealed a significant reduction in total podocyte Plekhh2 expression compared to controls. Sequence analysis indicated a putative a-helical coiled-coil segment as the only recognizable domain within the N-terminal half of the polypeptide, while the C-terminal half contains two PH, a MyTH4, and a FERM domain. We identified a phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate consensus-binding site in the PH1 domain required for Plekhh2 localization to peripheral regions of cell lamellipodia. The N-terminal half of Plekkh2 is not necessary for lamellipodial targeting but mediates self-association. Yeast two-hybrid screening showed that Plekhh2 directly interacts through its FERM domain with the focal adhesion protein Hic-5 and actin. Plekhh2 and Hic-5 coprecipitated and colocalized at the soles of podocyte foot processes in situ and Hic-5 partially relocated from focal adhesions to lamellipodia in Plekhh2-expressing podocytes. In addition, Plekhh2 stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton by attenuating actin depolymerization. Our findings suggest a structural and functional role for Plekhh2 in the podocyte foot processes.

As gene expression profiles (GEPs) reflect the biology of MM in individual patients, we built a prognostic signature based on GEPs. GEPs obtained from newly diagnosed MM patients included in the HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 trial (n = 290) were used as training data. Using this set, a prognostic signature of 92 genes (EMC-92-gene signature) was generated by supervised principal component analysis combined with simulated annealing. Performance of the EMC-92-gene signature was confirmed in independent validation sets of newly diagnosed (total therapy (TT) 2, n = 351; TT3, n = 142; MRC-IX, n = 247) and relapsed patients (APEX, n = 264). In all the sets, patients defined as high-risk by the EMC-92-gene signature show a clearly reduced overall survival (OS) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.40 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.19-5.29) for the TT2 study, 5.23 (95% CI: 2.46-11.13) for the TT3 study, 2.38 (95% CI: 1.65-3.43) for the MRC-IX study and 3.01 (95% CI: 2.06-4.39) for the APEX study (P<0.0001 in all studies). In multivariate analyses this signature was proven to be independent of the currently used prognostic factors. The EMC-92-gene signature is better or comparable to previously published signatures. This signature contributes to risk assessment in clinical trials and could provide a tool for treatment choices in high-risk MM patients.

The aim of this study was to explore clinico-pathological characteristics and differences of breast cancer in elderly Asian/Han-Chinese compared to Caucasian/Austrian women.

Methods: A total number of 630 consecutive primary operable, unilateral breast cancer cases, 70 years and older, were analyzed. Histo-pathological findings and biological characteristics of 198 Caucasian/Austrian were compared with 432 Asian/Han-Chinese. Pearson's chi-square test was used to assess differences in the analyzed populations.

Results: A significantly higher rate of triple-negative BC (p = 0.027) was diagnosed among the Chinese geriatric population. More estrogen-receptor positive BC was detected in the Caucasian study group (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were detected based on tumor size, axillary lymph-node status, nor HER2-receptor expression.

Recent advances in genetics and genomics have brought unprecedented insights into the domestication of many organisms and have opened new avenues for further improvements to be made. Yet, our ability to engineer biological systems is not without limits; genetic manipulation is often quite difficult. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not only one of the most powerful model organisms, but is also the premier producer of fermented foods and beverages around the globe. As a model system, it entertains a hefty workforce dedicated to deciphering its genome and the function it encodes at a rich mechanistic level. As a producer, it is used to make leavened bread, and dozens of different alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine. Yet, applying the awesome power of yeast genetics to understanding its origins and evolution requires some knowledge of its wild ancestors and the environments from which they were derived. A number of surprisingly diverse lineages of S.cerevisiae from both primeval and secondary forests in China have been discovered by Wang and his colleagues.

These pioneering scientists showed that populations are chock-full of genetic variation. This variation was a surprise that required a re-thinking of evolutionary genetic heuristics. Understanding the causes for the maintenance of this variation became and remains a major area of research. In the process of addressing the causes, this same group of scientists documented geographical genetic structure (Prakash etal. 1969), spawning the continued accumulation of what is now a huge case study catalogue of geographical differentiation (e.g. Loveless & Hamrick 1984; Linhart & Grant 1996). Geographical differentiation is clearly quite common. Yet, a truly general understanding of the patterns in and causes of spatial genetic structure across the genome remains elusive. To what extent is spatial structure driven by drift and phylogeography vs. geographical differences in environmental sources of selection? What proportion of the genome participates? A general understanding requires range-wide data on spatial patterning of variation across the entire genome. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Lasky etal. (2012) make important strides towards addressing these issues, taking advantage of three contemporary revolutions in evolutionary biology. Two are technological: high-throughput sequencing and burgeoning computational power. One is cultural: open access to data from the community of scientists and especially data sets that result from large collaborative efforts.

However, little is known of the ecology and population structure of this species in nature. Here, we present a field survey of this yeast at an unprecedented scale and have performed population genetics analysis of Chinese wild isolates with different ecological and geographical origins. We also included a set of worldwide isolates that represent the maximum genetic variation of S.cerevisiae documented so far. We clearly show that S.cerevisiae is a ubiquitous species in nature, occurring in highly diversified substrates from human-associated environments as well as habitats remote from human activity. Chinese isolates of S.cerevisiae exhibited strong population structure with nearly double the combined genetic variation of isolates from the rest of the world. We identified eight new distinct wild lineages (CHN IVIII) from a set of 99 characterized Chinese isolates. Isolates from primeval forests occur in ancient and significantly diverged basal lineages, while those from human-associated environments generally cluster in less differentiated domestic or mosaic groups. Basal lineages from primeval forests are usually inbred, exhibit lineage-specific karyotypes and are partially reproductively isolated. Our results suggest that greatly diverged populations of wild S.cerevisiae exist independently of and predate domesticated isolates. We find that China harbours a reservoir of natural genetic variation of S.cerevisiae and perhaps gives an indication of the origin of the species.

Theory predicts that dispersal by fat-tailed kernels reshuffles genetic material, and thus, preserves genetic diversity during colonization. Moreover, if efficient long-distance dispersal is coupled with random colonization, an inverse isolation effect is predicted to develop in which increasing genetic diversity per colonizer is expected with increasing distance from a genetically variable source. By contrast, increasing isolation leads to decreasing genetic diversity when dispersal is via thin-tailed kernels. Here, we use a well-established model group for dispersal biology (peat mosses: genus Sphagnum) with a fat-tailed dispersal kernel, and the natural laboratory of the Stockholm archipelago to study the validity of the inverse isolation hypothesis in spore-dispersed plants in island colonization. Population genetic structure of three species (Sphagnum fallax, Sphagnum fimbriatum and Sphagnum palustre) with contrasting life histories and ploidy levels were investigated on a set of islands using microsatellites. Our data show (phi(st)', amova, IBD) that dispersal of the two most abundant species can be well approximated by a random colonization model. We find that genetic diversity per colonizer on islands increases with distance from the mainland for S.fallax and S.fimbriatum. By contrast, S.palustre deviates from this pattern, owing to its restricted distribution in the region, affecting its source pool strength. Therefore, the inverse isolation effect appears to hold in natural populations of peat mosses and, likely, in other organisms with small diaspores.

The molecular basis for these fluctuations is unknown. Here we used a genetic complementation strategy to investigate expression changes during transient periods of Nanog downregulation. Employing an integrated approach that includes high-throughput single-cell transcriptional profiling and mathematical modelling, we found that early molecular changes subsequent to Nanog loss are stochastic and reversible. However, analysis also revealed that Nanog loss severely compromises the self-sustaining feedback structure of the ES cell regulatory network. Consequently, these nascent changes soon become consolidated to committed fate decisions in the prolonged absence of Nanog. Consistent with this, we found that exogenous regulation of Nanog-dependent feedback control mechanisms produced a more homogeneous ES cell population. Taken together our results indicate that Nanog-dependent feedback loops have a role in controlling both ES cell fate decisions and population variability.

Furthermore, evidence is accumulating that B cells and antibodies contribute to MS pathogenesis in at least a subset of patients. The CNS provides a B-cell-fostering environment that includes B-cell trophic factors such as BAFF (B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family), APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), and the plasma-cell survival factor CXCL12. Owing to this environment, the CNS of patients with MS is not only the target of the immunopathological process, but also becomes the site of local antibody production. B cells can increase or dampen CNS inflammation, but their proinflammatory effects seem to be more prominent in most patients, as B-cell depletion is a promising therapeutic strategy. Other therapies not primarily designed to target B cells have numerous effects on the B-cell compartment. This Review summarizes key features of B-cell biology, the role of B cells and antibodies in CNS inflammation, and current attempts to identify the targets of pathogenic antibodies in MS.

Specialized bone cells also evolved and produced endocrine hormones to integrate the skeleton in global mineral and nutrient homeostasis. The recognition of bone as a true endocrine organ represents a fertile area for further research and should improve the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus.

Human UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like PHD and RING finger domain-containing 1) has multiple domains that bind chromatin, and it is implicated genetically in the maintenance of DNA methylation. However, molecular mechanisms underlying DNA methylation regulation by UHRF1 are poorly defined. Here we show that UHRF1 association with methylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9) is required for DNA methylation maintenance. We further show that UHRF1 association with H3K9 methylation is insensitive to adjacent H3 S10 phosphorylation-a known mitotic 'phospho-methyl switch'. Notably, we demonstrate that UHRF1 mitotic chromatin association is necessary for DNA methylation maintenance through regulation of the stability of DNA methyltransferase-1. Collectively, our results define a previously unknown link between H3K9 methylation and the faithful epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation, establishing a notable mitotic role for UHRF1 in this process.

This method has advantages over existing strategies to induce gene silencing. Previous studies in fission yeast have characterized TGS as a cis-specific process involving RNA interference that maintains heterochromatic regions such as centromeres. In contrast, in mammalian cells, gene silencing is known to occur through a post-transcriptional mechanism that uses exogenous short interfering RNAs or endogenous microRNAs to inactivate mRNA. We now show that the introduction of convergent transcription plasmids into either Schizosaccharomyces pombe or mammalian cells allows the production of double-stranded RNA from inserted gene fragments, resulting in TGS of endogenous genes. We predict that using convergent transcription to induce gene silencing will be a generally useful strategy and allow for a fuller molecular understanding of the biology of TGS.

IMP3 expression is associated with triple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBCs), which are aggressive tumors associated with poor outcome. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that signaling pathways, which are characteristic of TNBCs, impact the expression of IMP3 and that IMP3 contributes to the function of TNBCs. The data obtained reveal that IMP3 expression is repressed specifically by estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) and its ligand 3 beta A-diol but not by ER alpha. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and consequent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway induce IMP3 transcription and expression. Interestingly, we discovered that the EGFR promoter contains an imperfect estrogen response element and that ER beta represses EGFR transcription. These data support a mechanism in which ER beta inhibits IMP3 expression indirectly by repressing the EGFR. This mechanism relates to the biology of TNBC, which is characterized by diminished ER beta and increased EGFR expression. We also demonstrate that IMP3 contributes to the migration and invasion of breast carcinoma cells. Given that IMP3 is an mRNA-binding protein, we determined that it binds several key mRNAs that could contribute to migration and invasion, including CD164 (endolyn) and MMP9. Moreover, expression of these mRNAs is repressed by ER beta and enhanced by EGFR signaling, consistent with our proposed mechanism for the regulation of IMP3 expression in breast cancer cells. Our findings show that IMP3 is an effector of EGFR-mediated migration and invasion and they provide the first indication of how this important mRNA-binding protein is regulated in cancer.

This biology is believed to account for the exquisite sensitivity of multiple myeloma (MM) to the proteasomal inhibitor bortezcmib (BTZ). Despite remarkable response rates to BTZ in MM, BTZ carries the potential for serious side-effects and development: of resistance. We, therefore, sought to identify therapeutic combinations that effectively disrupt proteostasis in order to provide new potential treatments for MM. We found that sulforaphane, a dietary isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, inhibits TNF alpha-induced I kappa beta proteasomal degradation in a manner similar to BTZ. Like BTZ, sulforaphane synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity of arsenic trioxide (ATO), an agent with clinical activity in MM. ATO and sulforaphane co-treatment augmented apoptotic induction as demonstrated by cleavage of caspase-3, -4 and PARP. The enhanced apoptotic response was dependent upon production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as demonstrated by glutathione depletion and partial inhibition of the apoptotic cascade after pretreatment with the radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Combination treatment resulted in enhanced ER stress signaling and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), indicative of perturbation of proteostasis. Specifically, combination treatment caused elevated expression of the molecular chaperone HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) along with increased PERK (protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase) and eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing, key indicators of UPR activation. Moreover, increased splicing of XBP1 was apparent upon combination treatment compared to treatment with either agent alone. Sulforaphane in combination with ATO effectively disrupts protein homeostasis through ROS generation and induction of ER stress to culminate in inhibition of protein secretion and apoptotic induction in MM. Our results suggest that sulforaphane deserves further investigation in combination with ATO in the treatment of MM.

The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor biology might pinpoint an alteration in expression of miRNAs as new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.

Methods: Expression levels of miR-143 and miR-21 and correlations with clinicopathological features were analyzed in 26 matched pairs of tumor and adjacent noncancerous tissue samples collected from patients with PCs, including 18 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) and 8 adenocarcinomas of Vater's papilla (PVACs).

Results: Compared to normal tissues, miR-143 was up-regulated in both PDAC and PVAC tumor samples (P = 0.0028 and P = 0.039, respectively). Conversely, alterations in miR-21 expression were significantly different in PDAC versus PVAC samples (P = 0.0049).

Synchronization frequently arises through chemical communication via signaling molecules distributed through an external medium. We study a simple theoretical model for dynamical quorum sensing: a heterogenous population of limit-cycle oscillators diffusively coupled through a common medium. We show that this model exhibits a rich phase diagram with four qualitatively distinct physical mechanisms that can lead to a loss of coherent population-level oscillations, including a novel mechanism arising from effective time-delays introduced by the external medium. We derive a single pair of analytic equations that allow us to calculate phase boundaries as a function of population density and show that the model reproduces many of the qualitative features of recent experiments on Belousov-Zhabotinsky catalytic particles as well as synthetically engineered bacteria.

Here we review and discuss several key examples of among-population variation in insect thermal performance, including latitudinal gradients in chill coma recovery time, variation in energy consumption and metabolic biochemistry, rapid changes in thermal biology with range expansion in invasive and introduced species, and potential constraints on variation in thermal performance traits. This review highlights that while there is substantial evidence for among-population variation that is generally correlated with local climate regimes, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the implications for whole-animal fitness in the field are well understood. We also discuss the potential limitations of interpreting evolved variation among populations and argue for a genes-to-environment approach to population-level variation in thermal biology of insects.

Although much is known about fruit development and climacteric ripening, little information is available about how ethylene biosynthesis is regulated during the postclimacteric phase. A targeted systems biology approach revealed a novel regulatory mechanism of ethylene biosynthesis of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) when fruit have reached their maximal ethylene production level and which is characterized by a decline in ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene production is shut down at the level of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase. At the same time, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase activity increases. Analysis of the Yang cycle showed that the Yang cycle genes are regulated in a coordinated way and are highly expressed during postclimacteric ripening. Postclimacteric red tomatoes on the plant showed only a moderate regulation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and Yang cycle genes compared with the regulation in detached fruit. Treatment of red fruit with 1-methylcyclopropane and ethephon revealed that the shut-down mechanism in ethylene biosynthesis is developmentally programmed and only moderately ethylene sensitive. We propose that the termination of autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis of system 2 in ripe fruit delays senescence and preserves the fruit until seed dispersal.

In woody species, growth phases and dormancy follow one another consecutively. In the oldest living individuals, the annual cycle may run for more than 1,000 years. So far, however, not much is known about the processes triggering reactivation from dormancy. In this study, we focused on wood rays, which are known to play an important role in tree development. The transition phase from dormancy to flowering in early spring was compared with the phase of active growth in summer. Rays from wood samples of poplar (Populus x canescens) were enriched by laser microdissection, and transcripts were monitored by poplar whole-genome microarrays. The resulting seasonally varying complex expression and metabolite patterns were subjected to pathway analyses. In February, the metabolic pathways related to flower induction were high, indicating that reactivation from dormancy was already taking place at this time of the year. In July, the pathways related to active growth, like lignin biosynthesis, nitrogen assimilation, and defense, were enriched. Based on ""marker"" genes identified in our pathway analyses, we were able to validate periodical changes in wood samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. These studies, and the resulting ray database, provide new insights into the steps underlying the seasonality of poplar trees.

Chorismate mutases have been widely studied experimentally and computationally to elucidate the transition state of the enzyme catalyzed reaction and the origin of the high catalytic rate. However, studies about substrate entry and product exit to and from the highly occluded active site of the enzyme have to our knowledge not been performed on this enzyme. Crystallographic data suggest a possible substrate entry gate, that involves a slight opening of the enzyme for the substrate to access the active site. Using multiple molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the natural dynamic process of the product exiting from the binding pocket of MtCM. We identify a dominant exit pathway, which is in agreement with the gate proposed from the available crystallographic data. Helices H2 and H4 move apart from each other which enables the product to exit from the active site. Interestingly, in almost all exit trajectories, two residues arginine 72 and arginine 134, which participate in the burying of the active site, are accompanying the product on its exit journey from the catalytic site.

The assembly state of newly made herpesvirus particles during anterograde transport in axons is an essential question in alphaherpesvirus biology. The structure of the particle has remained both elusive and controversial for the past two decades, with conflicting evidence from EM, immunofluorescence, and live cell imaging studies. Two opposing models have been proposedthe Married and Separate Models. Under the Married Model, infectious virions are assembled in the neuronal cell body before sorting into axons and then traffic inside a transport vesicle. Conversely, the Separate Model postulates that vesicles containing viral membrane proteins are sorted into axons independent of capsids, with final assembly of mature virions occurring at a distant egress site. Recently, a complementary series of studies employing high-resolution EM and live cell fluorescence microscopy have provided evidence consistent with the Married Model, whereas other studies offer evidence supporting the Separate Model. In this review, we compare and discuss the published data and attempt to reconcile divergent findings and interpretations as they relate to these models. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, there is no standard protocol for differentiating hESCs into osteoblastic cells. The aim of this study was to identify the emergence of a human stromal (mesenchymal and skeletal) stem cell (hMSC)-like population, known to be osteoblastic cell precursors and to test their osteoblastic differentiation capacity in ex vivo cultures and in vivo. We cultured hESCs in a feeder-free environment using serum replacement and as suspension aggregates (embryoid bodies; hEBs). Over a 20 day developmental period, the hEBs demonstrated increasing enrichment for cells expressing hMSC markers: CD29, CD44, CD63, CD56, CD71, CD73, CD105, CD106, and CD166 as revealed by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis. Ex vivo differentiation of hEBs using bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) combined with standard osteoblast induction medium led to weak osteoblastic induction. Conversely, subcutaneous in vivo implantation of day 20 hEBs in immune deficient mice, mixed with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) as an osteoconductive scaffold, revealed bone and cartilage, and fibrous tissue elements after 8 weeks. These tissues were of human origin and there was no evidence of differentiation to nonmesodermal tissues. hEBs implanted in the absence of HA/TCP formed vacuolated tissue containing glandular, fibrous and muscle-like tissue elements. Conversely, implantation of undifferentiated hESCs resulted in the formation of a teratoma containing a mixture of endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal tissues. Our study demonstrates that hMSC-like cells can be obtained from hESCs and they can be induced to form skeletal tissues in vivo when combined with HA/TCP. These findings are relevant for tissue engineering and suggest that differentiated hEBs can provide an unlimited source for functional osteogenic cells.

Nowadays, a variety of natural or synthetic Cap-based biomaterials are produced and have been extensively used for dental and orthopaedic applications. This is justified by their biocompatibility, osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity (i.e. the intrinsic material property that initiates de novo bone formation), which are attributed to the chemical composition, surface topography, macro/microporosity and the dissolution kinetics. However, the exact molecular mechanism of action is unknown. This review paper first summarizes the most important aspects of bone biology in relation to CaP and the mechanisms of bone matrix mineralization. This is followed by the research findings on the effects of calcium (Ca2+) and phosphate (PO43-) ions on the migration, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts during in vivo bone formation and in vitro culture conditions. Further, the rationale of using CaP for bone regeneration is explained, focusing thereby specifically on the material's osteoinductive properties. Examples of different material forms and production techniques are given, with the emphasis on the state-of-the art in fine-tuning the physicochemical properties of CaP-based biomaterials for improved bone induction and the use of CaP as a delivery system for bone morphogenetic proteins.

The present study investigated the dispersal and distribution of WCR larvae in the maize root system during their development at two growth stages of maize (BBCH 1314 and BBCH 1718). 2 Dispersal of the WCR larvae increased as they developed; the larvae moved off their original place of emergence and into deeper soil layers. Overall, changes in the horizontal distribution of the larvae were more extensive than changes in the vertical distribution. 3 The spatial analysis of distance indices revealed that the larvae had an aggregative distribution throughout their development. The feeding site of larvae in the root system was determined by the stage of larval development. Initially, WCR larvae started feeding in close proximity to their emergence location and moved to more developed root tissue towards the end of their development. 4 Differences in root phenology mainly influenced the distribution of the larvae at the end of their development, when larvae exhibited increased vertical movement at a later growth stage of maize. 5 The mechanisms of these distributional changes and the implications for the management of WCR larvae are discussed, especially with regard to chemical control, because fewer larvae are expected to be targeted at a later growth stage of maize.

Transmission of shear forces to platelet receptors such as GPIb alpha, P-selectin, alpha(2)beta(1), and alpha(2b)beta(3) controls adhesion dynamics. These forces also drive membrane tether formation, cellular deformation, and mechanosignaling in blood cells. Blood flow results in red blood cell (RBC) drift towards the center of the vessel along with a near-wall plasma layer enriched with platelets. RBC motions also dramatically enhance platelet dispersion. Trajectories of individual platelets near a thrombotic deposit dictate capture-activation-arrest dynamics as these newly arriving platelets are exposed to chemical gradients of ADP, thromboxane, and thrombin within a micron-scale boundary layer formed around the deposit. If shear forces are sufficiently elevated (> 50 dyne/cm(2)), the largest polymers of von Willebrand Factor may elongate with concomitant shear-induced platelet activation. Finally, thrombin generation enhances platelet recruitment and clot strength via fibrin polymerization.

Sepsis is a manifestation of disordered systemic inflammation. Properly regulated inflammation allows for timely recognition and effective reaction to injury or infection, but inadequate or overly robust inflammation can lead to Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). There is an incongruity between the systemic nature of disordered inflammation (as the target of inflammation-modulating therapies), and the regional manifestation of organ-specific failure (as the subject of organ support), that presents a therapeutic dilemma: systemic interventions can interfere with an individual organ system's appropriate response, yet organ-specific interventions may not help the overall system reorient itself. Based on a decade of systems and computational approaches to deciphering acute inflammation, along with translationally-motivated experimental studies in both small and large animals, we propose that MODS evolves due to the feed-forward cycle of inflammation -> damage -> inflammation. We hypothesize that inflammation proceeds at a given, ""nested"" level or scale until positive feedback exceeds a ""tipping point."" Below this tipping point, inflammation is contained and manageable; when this threshold is crossed, inflammation becomes disordered, and dysfunction propagates to a higher biological scale (e.g., progressing from cellular, to tissue/organ, to multiple organs, to the organism).

Biology, Treatment, and Outcome in Very Young and Older Women with DCIS","Abstract: This study examines a modern cohort of women with ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) in order to identify potential differences in clinical presentation, treatments, and outcome based on age.

From 1996 to 2009, a total of 2037 patients with pure DCIS were treated. Clinical presentation, pathologic factors, type of surgery and adjuvant therapy, and local recurrence rates among age groups were compared and analyzed. Median follow-up was 5.2 years.

There were 132 patients (6.5 %) aged < 40, 1,690 (83 %) aged 40-70, and 215 (10.5 %) aged > 70. Younger patients (< 40) were significantly more likely to have a family history of breast cancer, present with clinical symptoms, undergo mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, and have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (P < 0.05). Older patients (> 70) were significantly less likely to use adjuvant radiotherapy and tamoxifen (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in DCIS size, estrogen receptor status, necrosis, or contralateral breast cancer based on age. Among women < 40, 29.3 % had evidence of multicentric disease versus 17.7 and 13.3 % in the women aged 40-70 and those > 70, respectively (P = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, younger age (< 40), larger-size DCIS (a parts per thousand yen1.5 cm), and no use of radiotherapy were significant independent predictors of locoregional recurrence. The 5 year rates of local recurrence were 10.1 % in women < 40 compared with 3.2 % in older women (P = 0.005).

Current therapy incorporates chemotherapy to treat systemic disease and radiotherapy to assist with local control. We sought to evaluate the timing of surgery and role of adjuvant radiotherapy.

We reviewed the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital chest wall ES experience from 1979 to 2009. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment variables, and outcomes were analyzed with respect to timing of surgery and use of adjuvant radiotherapy.

Our cohort consisted of 36 patients with chest wall ES; median follow-up was 14.2 years, and 15-year estimate of overall survival was 66 %. In patients with localized disease, the timing of surgery (up-front vs. delayed) did not impact margin negativity or the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, but it did decrease the extent of chest wall resection. When considering radiotherapy in patients with localized disease, we found that patients who did not receive radiotherapy had smaller tumor size (median 6 vs. 10 cm) (p = 0.04) and were more likely to have had negative margins (p = 0.01) than patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient in each group developed a locoregional recurrence. The 15-year estimated of overall survival for patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy was 80 versus 100 % for those who did not.

Delayed surgery decreased the extent of chest wall resection and helped define a patient population with favorable tumor biology. Patients with complete pathologic responses to chemotherapy, and those with tumors < 8 cm and negative surgical margins may be spared adjuvant radiotherapy without any decrement in overall survival.

Its activity can be measured using an artificial substrate, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). Miller firstly described the standard quantitative assay of beta-galactosidase activity in the cells of bacterial cultures by disrupting the cell membrane with the permeabilization solution instead of preparing cell extracts. Therefore, beta-galactosidase became one of the most widely used reporters of gene expression in molecular biology to reflect intracellular gene expression difference. But the Miller assay procedure could not monitor the beta-galactosidase reaction in real time and its results were greatly influenced by some operations in the Miller procedure, such as permeabilization time, reaction time and concentration of the cell suspension. A scanning method based on the Miller method to determine the intracellular beta-galactosidase activity in E. coli Tuner (DE3) expressing beta-galactosidase in real time was developed and the permeabilization time of cells was optimized for that. The comparison of 3 assays of beta-galactosidase activity (Miller, colorimetric and scanning) was made. The results proved that scanning method for the determination of enzyme activity with using ONPG as substrate is simple, fast and reproducible.

The crab has virtually disappeared from areas where it was abundant, such as the Balearic Islands and the Catalan coast. Maja squinado, is economically and ecologically very valuable, and it is essential to obtain information on its biology and rearing conditions to attempt to repopulate the damaged stocks of the species in the Mediterranean basin. Herein, we describe the first successful rearing of M. squinado under laboratory conditions. Our results show that M. squinado is an excellent candidate for restocking using cultured juveniles.

However, the specific in vivo role of this ephrin receptor in OA remains unknown. We investigated in mice the in vivo effect of bone-specific EphB4 overexpression on OA pathophysiology.

Methods Morphometric, morphologic, and radiologic evaluations were performed on postnatal day 5 (P5) mice and on 10-week-old mice. Knee OA was induced surgically by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) in 10-week-old male EphB4 homozygous transgenic (EphB4-Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice. Medial compartment evaluations of cartilage were performed using histology and immunohistochemistry, and evaluations of subchondral bone using histomorphometry, osteoclast staining, and microcomputed tomography.

Results There was no obvious phenotype difference in skeletal development between EphB4-Tg mice and WT mice at P5 or at 10 weeks. At 8 and 12 weeks post-DMM, the EphB4-Tg mice demonstrated significantly less cartilage alteration in the medial tibial plateau and the femoral condyle than did the WT mice. This was associated with a significant reduction of aggrecan and type II collagen degradation products, type X collagen, and collagen fibril disorganization in the operated EphB4-Tg mice. The medial tibial subchondral bone demonstrated a significant reduction in sclerosis, bone volume, trabecular thickness, and number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatasepositive osteoclasts at both times assessed post-DMM in the EphB4-Tg mice than in the WT mice.

Conclusion This is the first in vivo evidence that bone-specific EphB4 overexpression exerts a protective effect on OA joint structural changes. The findings of this study stress the in vivo importance of subchondral bone biology in cartilage integrity.

High-throughput sequencing of microsatellite-enriched libraries dramatically expedites the traditional process of screening recombinant libraries for microsatellite markers. However, sorting through millions of reads to distill high-quality polymorphic markers requires special algorithms tailored to tolerate sequencing errors in locus reconstruction, distinguish paralogous loci, rarify raw reads originating from the same amplicon and sort out various artificial fragments resulting from recombination or concatenation of auxiliary adapters.

Results: In this study, we use dynamic Bayesian networks to make inferences regarding network structure and thereby generate testable hypotheses. We incorporate existing biology using informative network priors, weighted objectively by an empirical Bayes approach, and exploit a connection between variable selection and network inference to enable exact calculation of posterior probabilities of interest. The approach is computationally efficient and essentially free of user-set tuning parameters. Results on data where the true, underlying network is known place the approach favorably relative to existing approaches. We apply these methods to reverse-phase protein array time-course data from a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468) to predict signaling links that we independently validate using targeted inhibition.

She distinguishes two broad classes of such uses (weak and strong) on the basis of assumptions held by biologists about the role and the importance of natural selection. This is an interesting proposal that could help in the epistemological characterisation of some biological practices. However, Potochnik's distinction also rests on the assumption that all optimality modelling represent the selection dynamic involved in the system of phenomena being considered. Since this assumption does not hold for models belonging to optimal foraging theory (OFT)-one of behavioural ecology's important modelling traditions-Potochnik's proposal has to be critically reappraised. In this paper, we briefly discuss what is optimality modelling and what it means for a model to represent a dynamic of selection or of evolution. Then, we demonstrate that OFT modelling is unable to represent either past or contemporary selection dynamics. In order to make this point, we carefully delineate the theory's rationale. This allows us to identify and analyse the assumptions on which the theory is built, and to circumscribe precisely the role that natural selection plays in it. Next, we show that the distinction of weak and strong uses of optimality modelling is seriously weakened when OFT modelling is taken into account. More precisely, the distinction is either irrelevant (if the assumption that selection dynamics are represented in all optimality modelling is held) or of a modest utility (if the assumption is dropped). However, we suggest that Potochnik's original proposal could be saved, and that it even constitutes a tool to appraise the marks left in the literature by the evolution of optimality modelling practices in the last four decades, provided that it is made into a tripartite distinction.

Conventional demarcations of individuals and generations, such as physiological autonomy, unicellular bottlenecks, and alternation of generation, are rife with problems. Do physically separated cuttings or plant ramets constitute separate individuals or generations? Are chimaeras one or more individuals? To resolve these problems, Clarke (Biol Philos 27(3): 321-361, 2012) proposed that individuals are circumscribed by mechanisms that constrain heritable variance in fitness. Simultaneously, Gorelick and Heng (Evolution 65(4): 1088-1098 2011) showed that sex constrains heritable variance Therefore, for eukaryotes, meiosis and karyogamy provide a consistent way to demarcate individuals and generations. Epigenetic reset associated with meiosis and karyogamy rejuvenates the next generation, but not the parent(s) that engaged in the sex act. Wholesale epigenetic resets that probably only occur with meiosis and karyogamy imply that monozygotic twins are two different individuals, but apomictic progeny are diffuse parts of one disaggregated individual. Mitotic heritability circumscribes an individual, whereas meiotic heritability demarcates new individuals and generations.

Although BCR-ABL1 activation is present in all patients with CML, patients can present in 3 different phases characterized by an increasingly worse prognosis and diminished responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blastic phase. The biologic basis for progression from chronic phase to blastic phase and for regulating the homeostasis of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant CML stem cells is not entirely understood. METHODS: To shed some light into these aspects of CML biology, the authors used reverse phase protein arrays probed with 112 individual monoclonal antibodies to compare protein expression patterns in 40 samples of leukemia-enriched fractions from patients with CML (25 in chronic phase, 5 in accelerated phase, and 10 in phase). RESULTS: An analysis of variance (significance cutoff, P < .01) unveiled a set of proteins that were overexpressed in blastic phase, including heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90); retinoblastoma (Rb); apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF); serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); B-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2); X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (Xiap); human homolog of Drosophila Mad (mothers against decapentaplegic) and related Caenorhabditis elegans gene Sma, family member 1 (Smad1); single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 alpha (SSBP2a); poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP); GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2); and tripartite motif containing 24 (Trim24).

METHODS: Patients with localized LMS (excluding any gynecologic subtype) or SMD who underwent surgery at the authors' institution from 1994 to 2010 were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) and the crude cumulative incidence of local recurrence and distant metastasis (DM) were calculated, and multivariable analyses for DM and OS were carried out. RESULTS: In total, 327 patients were studied (71% LMS, 29% SMD). The median follow-up was 58 months (interquartile range, 31-97 months). The 5-year overall survival rate was 72.9% (95% confidence interval, 66.3%-80.2%) for the patients with LMS and 64.4% (95% confidence interval, 53.7%-77.1%) for the patients with SMD. The 5-year crude cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was 36.2% (95% confidence interval, 30.1%-43.5%) in the LMS group and 32.6% (95% confidence interval, 24%-44.2%) in the SMD group. Although tumor grade in LMS identified 3 distinct classes of risk, patients with grade 2 and grade 3 SMD had a similar course. The median postmetastasis survival was longer in patients with grade 3 LMS compared versus patients with grade 3 SMD (31 months vs 15 months, respectively). In patients who had grade 3 lesions, adjuvant chemotherapy yielded a better outcome in the SMD group compared with the LMS group (hazard ratio, 0.38). Patients who had superficial LMS had better outcomes compared with patients who had superficial SMD. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that LMS and SMD do not share the same natural history. A limited prognostic impact of grade was observed in patients with SMD. Differences in response to chemotherapy should be taken into account in planning the therapeutic approach for patients with these tumors.

On the basis of this new strategy, the ratiometric fluorescent probe 1 for aminothiols was judiciously designed. The new probe is highly selective toward aminothiols over other thiols and exhibits a very large variation (up to 160-fold) in its fluorescence ratio (I458/I603).

This species can be found from the San Maths Gulf, Argentina to Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil where it lives in symbiotic association with limpets of the family Calyptraeidae. Currently, two species of limpets have been reported as hosts of this species: Crepidula protea (d'Orbigny, 1841) and Crepidula argentina Simone, Pastorino & Penchaszadeh, 2000.

Thus, this pinnotherid appears to be, as others members of the family, a generalist symbiotic species since it dwells on almost all the potential limpet species reported for Argentina. However, there are notable differences in prevalence of C. garthi on each host, which suggest that the symbiont might prefer species of Crepidula over the others genera (Trochita and Bostrycapulus). Additionally, there exists an apparent relationship between host size and prevalence (e.g., Crepidula cachimilla, the limpet with the highest prevalence, is clearly larger than the others hosts). Perhaps it is premature to conclude that the size of the host might be of benefit for the symbiont, but it is a hypothesis worthy of being explored.

Since the discovery, in 1994, of recurrent codeletion of chromosome regions 1p36/19q13 in oligodendrogliomas, genetics has accomplished significant advances improving our knowledge in biology of this tumor type and our clinical management of oligodendroglioma patients. Indeed, 1p36/19q13 has been shown successively to predict increased chemosensitivity and better prognosis, to be associated with frontal location in brain and classic oligodendroglioma morphology, to be mutually exclusive with high-level gene amplification, to be actually whole chromosome arms 1p/19q codeletion, to mediate a t(1;19)(q10;p10) and to be associated with IDH mutations. More recently, pivotal studies, using high-throughput approaches, have provided significant novel insights in the molecular oncogenesis of oligodendrogliomas.

Recent findings

Capicua homolog (Drosophila) (CIC) and Far Upstream element Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1) have been shown to be frequently mutated in 70 and 40% of 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas, respectively. The biological and clinical significance of these mutations remains unsettled. Additional recent studies have also demonstrated that 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas exhibit a proneural transcriptomic profile including overexpression of internexin alpha, a neuronal intermediate filament. Finally, 1p/19q codeleted and IDH-mutated tumors have been shown to be hypermethylated, suggesting a strong link between these both molecular alterations detected in the subgroup of oligodendrogliomas with better prognosis.

Human nature is seen as a set of drives and capacities, which play a key role in people's actions in any social context. In the textbooks, a variety of arguments suggest the irrelevance of a concept of human nature to the discipline. Partly, this message is conveyed by opposing social to biological explanations. In addition, the discipline is framed to exclude the concept of human nature. Society, on the one hand, and the culturally unique individual, on the other, exhaust the sociological arena. Accounts of socialization imply the transcendence of biology and with that, human nature. Refutations of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are supported with broad ranging rejections of biological explanation, with a similar implication that human nature is not a necessary concept in sociological accounts. Nevertheless, human nature is the elephant in the room. The concept is required and assumed in the detail of these textbooks as they explain current sociological research and analysis. One impact of the denial of human nature is to misunderstand current disputes between sociology and evolutionary psychology.

Although K+ has been demonstrated to be necessary for diverse cellular functions, such as enzyme activation, additional, still uncharacterized cellular targets may exist. We show here that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae short-term potassium deprivation impacts in the mRNA level of over one thousand genes. Lack of potassium drastically alters sulfur metabolism (mainly Met and Cys metabolism), triggers an oxidative stress response and activates the retrograde pathway, possibly due to the ammonium accumulation that occurs through the Trk1 potassium transporter. We also observe a remarkable halt in the expression of genes required for ribosome biogenesis and translation, a decrease in expression of diverse components (cyclins, protein kinases) required for progression through the cell cycle and a blockage in septins assembly. Only specific subsets of these changes were observed in a strain deleted for the TRK1 and TRK2 genes growing in the presence of sufficient potassium (50 mM). Therefore, a shortage of potassium in the environment triggers an acute transcriptional response, which covers different aspects of the cell biology so far unexplored, and whose investigation will likely reveal novel functional roles for this cation.

It arises through somatic evolution, by mutation and selection among pathogen cells within a host. Here, we examine the hypothesis that evolution of drug resistance could be reduced by developing drugs that target the secreted metabolites produced by pathogen cells instead of directly targeting the cells themselves. Using an agent-based computational model of an evolving population of pathogen cells, we test this hypothesis and find support for it. We also use our model to explain this effect within the framework of standard evolutionary theory. We find that in our model, the drugs most robust against evolved drug resistance are those that target the most widely shared external products, or public goods, of pathogen cells. We also show that these drugs exert a weak selective pressure for resistance because they create only a weak correlation between drug resistance and cell fitness. The same principles apply to design of vaccines that are robust against vaccine escape.

Intradermal adipocytes regenerate with faster kinetics than other adipose tissue depots and in parallel with the hair cycle, suggesting an interplay exists between hair follicle cells and adipocytes. While adipocytes have well-established roles in metabolism and energy storage, until recently, they were overlooked as niche cells that provide important growth signals to neighbouring skin cells. We discuss recent data supporting adipocytes as niche cells for the skin and skin pathologies that may be related to alterations in skin adipose tissue defects.

Although originally defined as an inducer of Th2-mediated responses, IL-33 was recently found to be involved in arthritis, a Th1/Th17-mediated disease. Here, we assessed the ability of IL-33 to promote inflammation via mast cells (MCs) and keratinocytes (KCs) activation in psoriasis. IL-33 resulted elevated in the skin but not in the serum of psoriasis patients. IL-33 was secreted by psoriasis KCs and HaCaT cells after TNF-alpha stimulation. In HMC-1, TNF-alpha, but not IL-17, could induce a robust increase in IL-33 expression. In HaCaT cells, TNF-alpha was able to induce IL-6, MCP-1 and VEGF, and the addition of IL-33 reinforced these increases. TNF-alpha + IL-33 combination showed similar results in primary KCs and ex vivo skin organ culture. In conclusion, our study suggests that IL-33 may be involved in psoriasis biology via MCs and KCs.

This is increasingly translating into success in the clinic, with five new kinase inhibitor drugs approved since 2011. However, despite encouraging signs in other areas, success has been largely restricted to oncology.

Areas covered: This article reviews the prospects for kinase inhibitor drug discovery in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Major topics include the application of kinome profiling and lessons learned from kinase system-based research. With these fields nearing maturity, the validation of kinases as targets or their classification as liabilities is becoming increasingly pertinent. Other topics include a discussion of the properties required of good small molecule kinase probes.

Expert opinion: The tractability of protein kinases to small molecule discovery through system-based research is excellent, and adequate selectivity can often be achieved. With advances in screening methodology now enabling compound profiling across most of the kinome, researchers involved in drug discovery must decide what inhibition profiles are desirable. However, this assessment must be made on the basis of incomplete understanding of the disease biology of most kinases, and as a result there is a significant risk that drugs entering clinical trials will lack efficacy. Because of this, as well as greater effort to determine which kinases are therapeutically relevant for particular diseases, opportunities for quality pre-candidate compounds developed for specific indications to find alternative uses should be maximised by early screening through panels of phenotypic assays.

Areas covered: This review reports the background on the potential implication of the EGF/EGFR pathway in RCC, the different data on EGFR positivity in RCC and results from prospective Phase II and III trials on lapatinib in RCC, along with other EGF/EGFR inhibitors.

Expert opinion: Despite important progress and the real revolution of the past decade in treatment of RCC, treatment still remains palliative most of the time. To improve treatment, it is necessary to understand whether a specific population could be selected on a molecular feature of the tumor. Until there is better knowledge of the biology, further development of drugs such as lapatinib cannot be supported.

In the active state, Ras proteins interact with and modulate the activity of several downstream effectors regulating key cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, senescence, migration and metabolism. Activating mutations of RAS genes and of genes encoding Ras signaling members have a great incidence in proliferative disorders, such as cancer, immune and inflammatory diseases and developmental syndromes. Therefore, Ras and Ras signaling represent important clinical targets for the design and development of pharmaceutically active agents, including anticancer agents.

Areas covered: The authors summarize methods available to down-regulate the Ras pathway and review recent patents covering Ras signaling modulators, as well as methods designed to kill specifically cancer cells bearing activated RAS oncogene.

Expert opinion: Targeted therapy approach based on direct targeting of molecules specifically altered in Ras-dependent diseases is pursued with molecules that down-regulate expression or inhibit the biological function of mutant Ras or Ras signaling members. The low success rate in a clinical setting of molecules targeting activated members of the Ras pathway may require development of novel approaches, including combined and synthetic lethal therapies.

They serve to regulate protein expression at translational level and represent a relatively less known exception to the traditional central 'dogma' of biology that information flows as DNA -> RNA -> protein and that it is stored in a co-linear way between the 5'-> 3' of nucleic acids and N -> C-terminal of polypeptides. In archaea, in which translational recoding regulates the decoding of the 21st and the 22nd amino acids selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, respectively, only one case of programmed -1 frameshifting has been reported so far and further examples, although promising, have not been confirmed yet.

A geomicrobiological model of the different microbial cycles operating in the sediments was recently developed through molecular biological methods, suggesting the presence of iron reducers, methanogens, nitrate reducers and hydrogen producers. In this study, we used a combination of molecular biological methods and targeted enrichment incubations to validate this model and prove the existence of those potential anaerobic activities in the acidic sediments of Tinto River. Methanogenic, sulfate-reducing, denitrifying and hydrogen-producing enrichments were all positive at pH between 5 and 7. Methanogenic enrichments revealed the presence of methanogenic archaea belonging to the genera Methanosarcina and Methanobrevibacter. Enrichments for sulfate-reducing microorganisms were dominated by Desulfotomaculum spp. Denitrifying enrichments showed a broad diversity of bacteria belonging to the genera Paenibacillus, Bacillus, Sedimentibacter, Lysinibacillus, Delftia, Alcaligenes, Clostridium and Desulfitobacterium. Hydrogen-producing enrichments were dominated by Clostridium spp. These enrichments confirm the presence of anaerobic activities in the acidic sediments of the Tinto River that are normally assumed to take place exclusively at neutral pH.

An in vivo-like assay medium for enzyme activity determination was designed based on the concentrations of the major ionic constituents of the Escherichia coli cytosol: K+, Na+, Mg2+, phosphate, glutamate, sulfate and Cl-. The maximum capacities (V-max) of the extracted enzymes of two pathways were determined using both this in vivo-like assay medium and the assay medium specific for each enzyme. The enzyme activities differed between the two assay conditions. Most of the differences could be attributed to unsuspected, pleiotropic effects of K+ and phosphate. K+ activated some enzymes (aldolase, enolase and glutamate dehydrogenase) and inhibited others (phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphofructokinase, triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase), whereas phosphate inhibited all glycolytic enzymes and glutamine synthetase but only activated glutamine 2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase. Neither a high glutamate concentration, nor macromolecular crowding affected the glycolytic or nitrogen assimilation enzymes, other than through the product inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase by glutamate. This strategy of assessing all pathway enzymes kinetically under the same conditions may be necessary to avoid inadvertent differences between in vivo and in vitro biochemistry. It may also serve to reveal otherwise unnoticed pleiotropic regulation, such as that demonstrated in the present study by K+ and phosphate.

The cellular storage of squalene and its impact on membrane properties have been the subject of recent investigations. In a screen for abnormal lipid droplet morphology and distribution in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found significant lipid droplet clustering (arbitrarily defined as an aggregation of six or more lipid droplets) in a number of mutants (e.g. erg1) that are defective in sterol biosynthesis. Interestingly, these mutants are also characterized by accumulation of large amounts of squalene. Reducing the level of squalene in these mutants restored normal lipid droplet distribution. Moreover, inhibition of squalene monooxygenase in two mammalian cell lines (CHO-K1 and 3T3-L1) by terbinafine also resulted in lipid droplet clustering. These results indicate that the level of squalene may affect the growth and distribution of lipid droplets.

Because iron is an important regulator of ROS biology, this study examined the effects of iron chelation on the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling. The administration of an iron chelator, deferoxamine, to rats prevented chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Various iron chelators inhibited the growth of cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Protein carbonylation, an important iron-dependent biological event, was promoted in association with pulmonary vascular remodeling and cell growth. A proteomic approach identified that Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (a negative regulator of RhoA) is carbonylated. In human plasma, the protein carbonyl content was significantly higher in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension than in healthy controls. These results suggest that iron plays an important role in the ROS-dependent mechanism underlying the development of pulmonary hypertension. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our knowledge of HSC biology is limited by the paucity of in vivo data. HSCs and sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) reside in close proximity, and interactions between these two cell types are potentially critical for their development and function. Here, we introduce a transgenic zebrafish line, Tg(hand2:EGFP), that labels HSCs. We find that zebrafish HSCs share many similarities with their mammalian counterparts, including morphology, location, lipid storage, gene-expression profile, and increased proliferation and matrix production, in response to an acute hepatic insult. Using the Tg(hand2:EGFP) line, we conducted time-course analyses during development to reveal that HSCs invade the liver after SECs do. However, HSCs still enter the liver in mutants that lack most endothelial cells, including SECs, indicating that SECs are not required for HSC differentiation or their entry into the liver. In the absence of SECs, HSCs become abnormally associated with hepatic biliary cells, suggesting that SECs influence HSC localization during liver development. We analyzed factors that regulate HSC development and show that inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling significantly reduces the number of HSCs that enter the liver. We also performed a pilot chemical screen and identified two compounds that affect HSC numbers during development. Conclusion: Our work provides the first comprehensive description of HSC development in zebrafish and reveals the requirement of SECs in HSC localization. The Tg(hand2:EGFP) line represents a unique tool for in vivo analysis and molecular dissection of HSC behavior.

Methods and results: Two thousand one hundred and four peripheral lymphomas of various types were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated 1 (IRTA1), which recognizes the equivalents of MZ in human lymphoid tissues other than spleen. IRTA1 expression was restricted to extranodal (93%) and nodal MZLs (73%) and to lymphomas with MZ differentiation. Extranodal MZL cells with the strongest IRTA1 expression were usually located adjacent to epithelia, mimicking the IRTA1 expression pattern of normal and acquired mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The cytological features, growth pattern and IRTA1 positivity in nodal MZLs suggest they may derive from IRTA1(+) perifollicular B cells or monocytoid B cells detectable in reactive lymph nodes. Double immunostaining for IRTA1/bcl-6 tracked the colonization of B-cell follicles by MZL cells, and showed modulation of their phenotype (e.g. acquisition of bcl-6) during recirculation through germinal centres. MZL cells differentiating into plasma cells usually lost IRTA1.

Conclusions: These results further expand our knowledge of the biology of MZLs, and highlight IRTA1 as the first positive marker for MZLs, enabling more accurate diagnosis of these neoplasms.

DCN expression in the theca, the corpus luteum (CL), its presence in the follicular fluid (FF) and its actions revealed in human IVF-derived granulosa cells (GCs), suggest that it plays multiple roles in the ovary including folliculogenesis, ovulation and survival of the CL.

DCN is a secreted proteoglycan, which has a structural role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and also interferes with the signaling of multiple GF/GF receptors (GFRs). However, DCN expression and action in the primate ovary has yet to be determined.

Archival human and monkey ovarian samples were analyzed. Studies were conducted using FF and GC samples collected from IVF patients.

Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, RTPCR, quantitative RTPCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies were complemented by cellular studies, including the measurements of intracellular Ca-2, reactive oxygen species (ROS), epidermal GF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation by DCN and caspase activity.

Immunohistochemistry revealed strong DCN staining in the connective tissue and follicular thecal compartments, but not in GCs of pre-antral and antral follicles. Pre-ovulatory follicles could not be studied, but DCN was associated with connective tissue of CL samples and the cytoplasm of luteal cells. DCN expression in monkey CL doubled (P 0.05) towards the end of the luteal lifespan. DCN was found in human FF obtained from IVF patients (mean: 12.9 ng/ml; n 20) as determined by ELISA. DCN mRNA and/or protein were detected in freshly isolated and cultured, luteinized human GCs. In the latter, exogenous human recombinant DCN increased intracellular Ca-2 levels and induced the production of ROS in a concentration-dependent manner. DCN, like epidermal GF, phosphorylated EGFR significantly (P 0.05) and reduced the activity of caspase 3/7 in cultured GCs. The data indicate the expression of DCN in the theca of growing follicles, in FF of ovulatory follicles and in the CL. Therefore, DCN may exert paracrine actions via GF/GFR systems in multiple ovarian compartments.

Functional studies were performed in cultures of human luteinized GCs, which are an apt model but may not fully mirror the pre-ovulatory GC compartment or the CL. Other human ovarian cells, including the thecal cells, were not available.

In accordance with its evolving roles in other organs, ovarian DCN is an ECM-associated component, which acts as a multifunctional regulator of GF signaling in the primate ovary. DCN may thus be involved in folliculogenesis, ovulation and the regulation of the CL survival in primates.

The scale of the problems that are discussed ranges from small molecules to complex systems, where many organisms coexist. However, among all these issues, we can highlight genomics, which studies the genomes of microorganisms, plants, and animals. Predicting common patterns, i.e., motifs, in a set of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences is one of the important sequence analysis problems, and it has not yet been resolved in an efficient manner. In this study, we study the application of evolutionary multiobjective optimization to solve the motif discovery problem, applied to the specific task of discovering novel transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences. For this, we have designed, adapted, configured, and evaluated several types of multiobjective metaheuristics. After a detailed study, the results indicate that these metaheuristics are appropriate for discovering motifs. To find good approximations to the Pareto front, we use the hypervolume indicator, which has been successfully integrated into evolutionary algorithms. Besides the hypervolume indicator, we also use the coverage relation to ensure: Which is the best Pareto front?

In this imaging technique, the optical properties of tissues are reconstructed from the measurements obtained from the sensors located on the boundary. A computational method for the rapid noninvasive detection/quantification of cerebral hemorrhage is described using the above procedure. CFD Research Corporation's finite volume computational biology code was used to numerically mimic the NIRS procedure by (i) noninvasively numerically penetrating the brain tissues and (ii) reconstructing the optical properties the presence of water, oxygenated, and deoxygenated blood. These numerical noninvasive measurements are then used to predict the extent and severity of the brain hemorrhage. The paper also discusses ideas to obtain the location and the severity of a localized injury. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations are performed as a proof of concept for the numerical formulation being feasible for the above mentioned detection/quantification. The results demonstrate that this numerical NIRS formulation can be used as a noninvasive technique for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics.

However, the mechanisms of SMSC chondrogenesis remain to be identified and characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway, as well as the manner by which it may contribute to chondrogenesis and the actin cytoskeletal organization of tat temporomandibular SMSCs in response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Primary isolated SMSCs were treated with TGF-beta 1, and their actin organization was examined by fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin staining. The specific biochemical inhibitors, C3 transferase, Y27632 and SB431542, were employed to evaluate the function of RhoA/ROCK and Smads. The effect of C3 transferase and Y27632 on the gene expression of chondrocyte-specific markers was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. To examine the effect of Y27632 on Smad2/3 phosphorylation induced by TGF-beta 1, western blot analysis was also performed. The stimulation of TGF-beta 1 in SMSCs resulted in the activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway and concomitantly induced cytoskeletal reorganization, which was specifically blocked by C3 transferase and Y27632. The TGF-beta-induced gene expression of Sox9, type I collagen, type II collagen and aggrecan was also inhibited by both C3 transferase and Y27632, at different levels. Y27632 treatment reduced the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the RhoA/ROCK activation regulates chondrocyte-specific gene transcription and cytoskeletal organization induced by TGF-beta 1 by interacting with the Smad pathway. This may have significant implications for the successful utilization of SMSCs as a cell source for articular cartilage tissue engineering.

Forty-six patients who underwent radical cystectomy without preoperative chemotherapy and had histologically proven nodal metastasis were included in the study. The status of lymph nodes and primary lesion was analyzed in terms of disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival.

The 5-year disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival for the 46 patients overall were 41.3 and 32.2, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that pN status, the total number of involved lymph nodes, lymph node density and extranodal invasion were statistically significant variables predictive of disease-specific survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that the total number of involved lymph nodes, extranodal invasion and diameter of the metastatic lesion were statistically significant variables predictive of disease-specific survival. Interestingly, the diameter of metastatic lesions was inversely correlated with poorer survival. Patients with large (epsilon 10 mm) metastatic lesions and no extranodal invasion (expansive growth) had significantly better disease-specific survival than those with multiple small (10 mm) metastatic lesions and no extranodal invasion (highly spreading) (P 0.0156) or those with extranodal invasion (infiltrative growth) (P 0.0181).

Our data indicate that the clinical outcome of node-positive patients is not only stratified according to the tumor burden reflected in the total number of involved lymph nodes, but also affected by tumor biology including invasiveness and potential for metastasis, which is reflected in pathological characteristics such as extranodal invasion and the diameter of metastatic lesions.

Comparative analyses are used to address the key question of what makes a species more prone to extinction by exploring the links between vulnerability and intrinsic species traits and/or extrinsic factors. This approach requires comprehensive species data but information is rarely available for all species of interest. As a result comparative analyses often rely on subsets of relatively few species that are assumed to be representative samples of the overall studied group.

2. Our study challenges this assumption and quantifies the taxonomic, spatial, and data type biases associated with the quantity of data available for 5415 mammalian species using the freely available life-history database PanTHERIA.

3. Moreover, we explore how existing biases influence results of comparative analyses of extinction risk by using subsets of data that attempt to correct for detected biases. In particular, we focus on links between four species traits commonly linked to vulnerability (distribution range area, adult body mass, population density and gestation length) and conduct univariate and multivariate analyses to understand how biases affect model predictions.

4. Our results show important biases in data availability with c.22% of mammals completely lacking data. Missing data, which appear to be not missing at random, occur frequently in all traits (1499% of cases missing). Data availability is explained by intrinsic traits, with larger mammals occupying bigger range areas being the best studied. Importantly, we find that existing biases affect the results of comparative analyses by overestimating the risk of extinction and changing which traits are identified as important predictors.

5. Our results raise concerns over our ability to draw general conclusions regarding what makes a species more prone to extinction. Missing data represent a prevalent problem in comparative analyses, and unfortunately, because data are not missing at random, conventional approaches to fill data gaps, are not valid or present important challenges. These results show the importance of making appropriate inferences from comparative analyses by focusing on the subset of species for which data are available. Ultimately, addressing the data bias problem requires greater investment in data collection and dissemination, as well as the development of methodological approaches to effectively correct existing biases.

The animals were obtained by systematic sampling in three intertidal zones (high, mid and low), from October 2008 to September 2009. The population density was low during most of spring and summer, increased during autumn and reached its maximum values at the end of this season (35 000 individuals/m(2)): a second, but lower, density peak occurred at the end of winter (15 000 individuals/m(2)). Male density remained below 1000 individuals/m(2) during most of the year in the three zones, although in September it was higher than 1800 individuals/m(2) in the high and mid intertidal zones.

However, the community specialization index is associated with a very specific kind of function the species response which has no clear link with ecosystem functioning. This problem is frequent in the literature on biotic homogenization. There is no clear sign in the data shown by Abadie et al. that metrics incorporating species attributes are much more reliable than taxonomic diversity indices. As frequently observed in the literature on biotic homogenization within communities, their results show no sign of loser or winner species or of extirpation of specialist species. Therefore, there seems to be no evidence in support of the biotic homogenization model they propose. Synthesis. The Average Community Specialization a mean specialization index is in itself incapable of identifying loser and winner species and has no clear link with ecosystem functioning. Methods other than mean trait approaches should be used to study either functional homogenization or the extirpation of specialist species.

Here, we assessed whether the presence of root aerenchyma can account for both the fundamental and realized ecohydrological niche in the Restionaceae. We documented the ability to make aerenchyma of almost 300 of the c. 350 South African Restionaceae species with the help of field observations, cultivation experiments and herbarium collections, and correlated this information with the ecohydrological niche of the species. We used a diversity of sampling approaches to account for variation in both aerenchyma and habitat at individual, population and species level. Tolerance of waterlogging in species with and without aerenchyma was investigated experimentally. To account for phylogenetic relatedness, the evolution of both aerenchyma and the ecohydrological niche was explored in the context of an almost complete species-level phylogeny using both parsimony and maximum likelihood optimization methods. We showed that the presence of aerenchyma was correlated with the ecohydrological niche at population and at species level, and after phylogenetic correction. Most individuals of non-aerenchymatous species died when waterlogged, whereas most species with aerenchyma were waterlogging tolerant. This indicates that waterlogging acts as an environmental filter that excludes non-aerenchymatous species from these conditions. The absence, and to a certain degree also the presence, of aerenchyma predicts both the field-observed realized and experimentally determined fundamental ecohydrological niche. Aerenchyma was ancestrally present as inferred by both parsimony and maximum likelihood reconstruction and showed a strong phylogenetic signal with frequent losses but few gains. The ecohydrological niche was evolutionary more labile, with niche changes in many evolutionary lineages. Changes from wetland to dry habitats were reconstructed in species with aerenchyma, whereas the reverse change was never inferred for species that had lost aerenchyma. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence that functional traits can effectively predict species niches, and evolution of these may constrain the habitats available to the clades. We underpin the importance of understanding the causal driver of the local distribution of species for making robust predictions of species range shifts under climate change.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious.

In addition to temperature and ocean acidification, increasing levels of hyposaline stress due to extreme precipitation events and freshwater runoff may be driving some of the reported recent range shifts in marine organisms. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry, we characterized the proteomic responses of the cold-adapted blue mussel Mytilus trossulus, a native to the Pacific coast of North America, and the warm-adapted M. galloprovincialis, a Mediterranean invader that has replaced the native from the southern part of its range, but may be limited from expanding north due to hyposaline stress. After exposing laboratory-acclimated mussels for 4 h to two different experimental treatments of hyposaline conditions and one control treatment (24.5, 29.8 and 35.0 psu, respectively) followed by a 0 and 24 h recovery at ambient salinity (35 psu), we detected changes in the abundance of molecular chaperones of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), indicating protein unfolding, during stress exposure. Other common responses included changes in small GTPases of the Ras superfamily during recovery, which suggests a role for vesicle transport, and cytoskeletal adjustments associated with cell volume, as indicated by cytoskeletal elements such as actin, tubulin, intermediate filaments and several actin-binding regulatory proteins. Changes of proteins involved in energy metabolism and scavenging of reactive oxygen species suggest a reduction in overall energy metabolism during recovery. Principal component analyses of protein abundances suggest that M. trossulus is able to respond to a greater hyposaline challenge (24.5 psu) than M. galloprovincialis (29.8 psu), as shown by changing abundances of proteins involved in protein chaperoning, vesicle transport, cytoskeletal adjustments by actin-regulatory proteins, energy metabolism and oxidative stress. While proteins involved in energy metabolism were lower in M. trossulus during recovery from hyposaline stress, M. galloprovincialis showed higher abundances of those proteins at 29.8 psu, suggesting an energetic constraint in the invader but not the native congener. Both species showed lower levels of oxidative stress proteins during recovery. In addition, oxidative stress proteins associated with protein synthesis and folding in the ER showed lower levels during recovery in M. galloprovincialis, in parallel with ER chaperones, indicating a reduction in protein synthesis. These differences may enable the native M. trossulus to cope with greater hyposaline stress in the northern part of its range, as well as to outcompete M. galloprovincialis in the southern part of M. trossulus range, thereby preventing M. galloprovincialis from expanding further north.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with a strong risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, typically preceded by dysplastic alterations of cell morphology. We investigated the molecular mechanisms and the functional consequences of HCV-driven perturbations of epithelial polarity.

Methods:We used biochemical, genetic, and cell biology approaches to assess the impact of hepatitis C viral protein NS5A on the polarity and function of hepatocytes and hepatic progenitors. Transgenic animals and xenograft models served for in vivo validation of the results obtained in cell culture.

Results: We found that expression of HCV-NS5A in primary hepatic precursors and in immortalized hepatocyte cell lines gave rise to profound modifications of cell polarity, leading to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). NS5A, either alone or in the context of the full complement of viral proteins in the course of infection, acted through activating Twist2, a transcriptional regulator of EMT. The effects of NS5A were additive to those of TGF-beta, a cytokine abundant in diseased liver and highly relevant to HCV-related pathology. Moreover, NS5A cooperates with oncogenic Ras, giving rise to transformed, invasive cells that are highly tumorigenic in vivo.

Conclusions: Our data suggest that in the context of HCV infection, NS5A favors formation of preneoplastic lesions by disrupting cell polarity and additional oncogenic events cooperate with the viral protein to give rise to motile and invasive tumour cells.

In this study, we show that exogenous IL-15 decreased IL-17A production in Th17 cultures. Neutralization of IL-15 using an Ab led to increases in IL17A production in Th17 cultures. Both Il15(-/-) and Il15r(-/-) T cell cultures displayed higher frequency of IL-17A producers and higher amounts of IL-17A in the supernatants compared with those of wild-type (WT) cells in vitro. IL-15 down-modulated IL-17A production independently of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-gamma t, Foxp3, and IFN-gamma expression. Both Th17 cells and APCs produced IL-15, which induced binding of STAT5, an apparent repressor to the Il17 locus in CD4 T cells. Also, in a model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Il15(-/-) mice displayed exacerbated inflammation-correlating with increased IL-17A production by their CD4(+) T cells-compared with WT controls. Exogenous IL-15 administration and IL-17A neutralization reduced the severity of EAE in Il15(-/-) mice. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-15 has a negative regulatory role in fine-tuning of IL-17A production and Th17-mediated inflammation. The Journal of Immunology, 2012, 189: 4237-4246.

In this study, we determined the ionic current activities of the SecA-dependent channel from membrane vesicles depleted of SecYEG. We found that these SecYEG-depleted membranes produced SecA-dependent ionic currents in the oocytes, as did membranes containing SecYEG. However, reconstituted membranes depleted of SecYEG required higher concentrations of SecA to elicit ionic currents like those in membranes containing SecYEG. In contrast to membranes containing SecYEG, the proofreading capacity of signal peptides was lost for those membranes lacking SecYEG. These findings are consistent with loss of signal peptide specificity in channel activity from membranes of SecY suppressor or SecY plug domain mutants. The signal peptide specificity of the reconstituted membranes, like SecA-liposomes, can be restored by the addition of SecYEG proteoliposomes. On the other hand, the channel activity efficiency of reconstituted membranes was fully restored, while SecA-liposomes could only be partially enhanced by the addition of SecYEG, indicating that, in addition to SecYEG, other membrane proteins contribute to the efficiency of channel activity. The SecA-dependent channels in membranes that lacked SecYEG also lost ion selectivity to monovalent cations but retained selective permeability to large anions. Thus, the electrophysiological evidence presented here indicates that SecYEG is not obligatory for the channel activity of Escherichia coli membranes, as previously shown for protein translocation, and that SecYEG is important for maintenance of the efficiency and specificity of SecA-dependent channels.

To help address this, the authors developed the Life Sciences Domain Analysis Model (LS DAM), an information model that provides a framework for communication among domain experts and technical teams developing information systems to support biomedical research. The LS DAM is harmonized with the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model of protocol-driven clinical research. Together, these models can facilitate data exchange for translational research.

Materials and methods The content of the LS DAM was driven by analysis of life sciences and translational research scenarios and the concepts in the model are derived from existing information models, reference models and data exchange formats. The model is represented in the Unified Modeling Language and uses ISO 21090 data types.

Results The LS DAM v2.2.1 is comprised of 130 classes and covers several core areas including Experiment, Molecular Biology, Molecular Databases and Specimen. Nearly half of these classes originate from the BRIDG model, emphasizing the semantic harmonization between these models. Validation of the LS DAM against independently derived information models, research scenarios and reference databases supports its general applicability to represent life sciences research.

Discussion The LS DAM provides unambiguous definitions for concepts required to describe life sciences research. The processes established to achieve consensus among domain experts will be applied in future iterations and may be broadly applicable to other standardization efforts.

Conclusions The LS DAM provides common semantics for life sciences research. Through harmonization with BRIDG, it promotes interoperability in translational science.

To assess the difference between the two approaches, 1,040 articles with a variant of the phrase ""evolutionarily stable strategies"" (ESS) were identified by searching the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA) and discipline-level databases. The majority (72%) of all articles were published in life sciences journals. The ESS concept is associated with a small set of canonical publications by John Maynard Smith; OBI represents a decoupling of the use of the phrase and a citation to a John Maynard Smith publication. Across all articles at the record level, OBI is measured by the number of articles with the phrase in the database record but which lack a reference to a source article (implicit citations). At the citation-in-context level, articles that coupled a non-Maynard Smith citation with the ESS phrase (indirect citations) were counted along with those that cited relevant Maynard Smith publications (explicit citations) and OBI counted only based on those articles that lacked any citation coupled with the ESS text phrase. The degree of OBI observed depended on the level of analysis. Record-level OBI trended upward, peaking in 2002 (62%), with a secondary drop and rebound to 53% (2008). Citation-in-context OBI percentages were lower with no clear pattern. Several issues relating to the design of empirical OBI studies are discussed.

In combination with m-nitrobenzyl alcohol, molecular ion charge states that are greater than the number of basic sites in the protein can be produced from these native solutions, even for lysozyme, which is conformationally constrained by four intramolecular disulfide bonds. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that the conformation of ubiquitin is not measurably affected with up to 1.0 M LaCl3, but ion mobility data indicate that the high charge states that are formed when 1.0 mM LaCl3 is present are more unfolded than the low charge states formed without this reagent. These and other results indicate that the increased charging is a result of La3+ preferentially adducting onto compact or more native-like conformers during ESI and the gas-phase ions subsequently unfolding as a result of increased Coulomb repulsion. Electron capture dissociation of these high charge-state ions formed from these native solutions results in comparable sequence coverage to that obtained for ions formed from denaturing solutions without supercharging reagents, making this method a potentially powerful tool for obtaining structural information in native mass spectrometry.

We have developed a novel flow-perfusion bioreactor designed to support lacunocanalicular fluid flow. We hypothesize that ex vivo fluid flow can maintain endochondral bone viability and, ultimately, serve as a novel model to study bone biology in vitro. SpragueDawley rat femurs were harvested, stripped of soft tissue, loaded into a custom-designed bioreactor and perfused with osteogenic culture medium. After 14?days of flow-perfusion or static culture, the bones were harvested, fixed, decalcified, embedded, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Fresh long bone samples were similarly processed for comparison. Osteocyte viability and function were also evaluated, using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT), fluorospectrophotometric DNA quantification, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) colorimetric assay and fluorochrome labelling of mineralizing surfaces. All samples remained free of infection throughout the study period. After 14?days of flow perfusion, histological analysis showed normal-appearing bony architecture, with 72% of lacunae being osteocyte-filled compared with 93% in freshly harvested samples and only 36% in static samples. MTT staining and assay confirmed osteocyte viability in the flow-perfusion samples as well as in fresh samples.

Full thickness 1.5?mm circular defects were created in parietal bones obtained from one litter of 4-day-old CD1 mice. The bones were divided into two groups and embedded with PCL or PCL/PVPA scaffolds. The healing response was evaluated using microcomputed tomography, dissecting microscopy, phase contrast microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. There was a significant increase (P?<?0.05) in bone fill percentage in the presence of the PCL/PVPA scaffold (63.57%) compared with PCL scaffolds (29.64%). The formation of tissue and deposition of extracellular matrix was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. There was evidence of collagen fibre deposition as well as hydroxyapatite and overall woven bone formation. PCL/PVPA scaffolds were better integrated into the defect site. The potential formation of hydroxyapatite was evaluated using energy dispersive spectroscopy. Results showed a significant increase in calcium and phosphorus levels in the presence of PCL/PVPA scaffold. Histological analysis using Masson's trichrome staining confirmed the presence of collagen above and below the PCL/PVPA scaffold within the defect site.

A developmental approach,"Abstract: Chondrogenically differentiating bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) display signs of chondrocyte hypertrophy, such as production of collagen type X, MMP13 and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL). For cartilage reconstructions this is undesirable, as terminally differentiated cartilage produced by BMSCs mineralizes when implanted in vivo. Terminal differentiation is not restricted to BMSCs but is also encountered in chondrogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well as embryonic stem cells, which by definition should be able to generate all types of tissues, including stable cartilage. Therefore, we propose that the currently used culture conditions may drive the cells towards terminal differentiation. In this manuscript we aim to review the literature, supplemented by our own data to answer the question, is it possible to generate stable hyaline cartilage from adult MSCs? We demonstrate that recently published methods for inhibiting terminal differentiation (through PTHrP, MMP13 or blocking phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8) result in cartilage formation with reduction of hypertrophic markers, although this does not reach the low level of stable chondrocytes. A set of hypertrophy markers should be included in future studies to characterize the phenotype more precisely. Finally, we used what is currently known in developmental biology about the differential development of hyaline and terminally differentiated cartilage to provide thought and insights to change current culture models for creating hyaline cartilage. Inhibiting terminal differentiation may not result in stable hyaline cartilage if the right balance of signals has not been created from the start of culture onwards.

In this study, we made use of these variants to identify mutations that confer sensitivity and resistance to the broadly neutralizing antibodies found in the sera of selected HIV-1-infected individuals. For these studies, libraries of Env proteins were cloned from infected subjects and screened for infectivity and neutralization sensitivity. The nucleotide sequences of the Env proteins were then compared for pairs of neutralization-sensitive and -resistant viruses. In vitro mutagenesis was used to identify the specific amino acids responsible for the neutralization phenotype. All of the mutations altering neutralization sensitivity/resistance appeared to induce conformational changes that simultaneously enhanced the exposure of two or more epitopes located in different regions of gp160. These mutations appeared to occur at unique positions required to maintain the quaternary structure of the gp160 trimer, as well as conformational masking of epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Our results show that sequences in gp41, the CD4 binding site, and the V2 domain all have the ability to act as global regulators of neutralization sensitivity.

We determined nest site selection characteristics (n?=?180) and examined spatial patterns (n?=?215) of snowy plover nests in saline lakes in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas. At 104 nests, we examined the influence of substrate type on nest temperatures and heat mitigation. Snowy plover nests were more likely to be found near an object, on pebble substrate, and with fewer plants than random sites. High use areas were generally located in areas with pebble substrate and on human-made or natural islands, berms, and peninsulas. Overall, nests placed on pebble substrate had lower temperatures during the day than nests placed on sand substrates. Nest placement on pebble substrate may be valuable to nesting snowy plovers, providing thermal advantages to incubating adults and depressing potentially high nest predation rates. Management guidelines for this region should emphasize the importance of addressing key elements of snowy plover nesting habitat including the presence of pebble substrate and reducing vegetation encroachment.

We mapped parity mode and the timing of gametogenesis in males and females on a genus-level phylogenetic tree for the family, derived from the literature. For those genera for which reproduction data were not available, we investigated male reproductive activity for representative species using museum material. In addition, we constructed an area cladogram to recover ancestral ranges. Our parsimony analysis retrieved two equally parsimonious solutions for evolutionary transformations in parity mode and reproductive timing in the Cordylidae. Both solutions suggest that oviparity and spring gametogenesis in both males and females (synchronized breeding) is the basal condition in the family. The correlated evolution of viviparity and autumn breeding has been noted in many lizard clades, and we therefore prefer the solution suggesting (1) that the transformations from oviparity to viviparity and from spring to autumn gametogenesis occurred simultaneously in the most recent common ancestor of the Cordylinae, and (2) that a subsequent return to spring spermatogenesis occurred in the most recent common ancestor of the Ouroborus-Karusasaurus-Namazonurus-Hemicordylus-Cordylus clade, a distinctly western clade. The evolution of viviparity and autumn spermatogenesis in the most recent common ancestor of the Cordylinae appears to have been correlated with the onset of cooler climates during the Oligocene while the return to spring spermatogenesis appears to be have been correlated with the aridification of the western parts of southern Africa during the early Miocene.

Membrane perturbation can incur multiple responses in mammalian cells. The present discussion will focus on the interplay between membrane-damaging agents and the function of cell-bound metalloproteinases of the ADAM family. These transmembrane enzymes have emerged as the major proteinase family that mediate the proteolytic release of membrane-associated proteins, a process designated as ""shedding"". They liberate a large spectrum of functionally active molecules including inflammatory cytokines, growth factor receptors and cell adhesion molecules, thereby regulating such vital cellular functions as cell-cell adhesion, cell proliferation and cell migration. ADAM activation may constitute part of the cellular recovery machinery on the one hand, but likely also promotes inflammatory processes on the other. The mechanisms underlying ADAM activation and the functional consequences thereof are currently the subject of intensive research.

Recent work has illuminated a multiplicity of spatially and temporally coordinated virus-host interactions that accompany HBV particle genesis. These interactions include the requirement of cellular chaperones for the maturation of the three viral envelope proteins, the cellular factors involved in dynamic modification, maturation, and intracellular trafficking of the nucleocapsids, and the host components of the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway enabling virion budding at intracellular compartments. Beside infectious virions, HBV produces at least two other types of particles, subviral empty envelope particles and subviral naked capsid particles, likely as a result of the engagement of different host factors by the viral structural proteins. Accordingly, HBV exploits distinct cellular pathways to release its particle types. Here, I review recent progress in these areas of the cell biology of HBV genesis.

These effects facilitate survival of the parasite within the host cell and tend to increase the virulence of disease that includes cerebral malaria and anemia. Numerous proteins secreted by the internalized parasite and interacting with red cell membrane proteins are responsible for the changes occurring to the host cell. Anemia, a serious clinical manifestation of malaria, is due to increased destruction of both infected and uninfected red cells due to membrane alterations, as well as ineffective erythropoiesis. There is very good evidence that various red cell disorders including hemoglobinopathies and hereditary ovalocytosis decrease the virulence of disease following parasite infection.

We designed, fabricated, and characterized a microfluidic-based device for trapping and releasing single beads by controlling elastomeric valves driven by pneumatic pressure and a fluid flow action. The fluid flow is controlled to ensure that beads flowing in a main stream enter into a branch channel. A bead is trapped by deflected elastomeric valves positioned at the entrance of a branch channel. The trapped bead is easily released by removing the applied pressure. The trapping and releasing of single beads of 21 mu m in diameter were successfully performed under an optimized pressure and flow rate ratio. Moreover, we confirmed that continuous trapping and releasing of single beads by repeatedly switching elastomeric valves enables the collection of a controllable number of beads. Our simple method can be integrated into microfluidic systems that require single or multiple particle arrays for quantitative and high-throughput assays in applications within the fields of biology and chemistry.

The research results on space biology have shown that the major mutagenic factors in space are microgravity and ionizing radiation. In addition, possible synergistic effects of radiation and microgravity on human cells are not well understood. In this study, human immortal lymphoblastoid cells were established from human peripheral blood lymphocytes and the cells were treated with low dose (0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 Gy) cumulative Co-60 gamma-irradiation and simulated weightlessness [obtained by culturing cells in the Rotating Cell Culture System (RCCS)]. The commonly used indexes of cell damage such as micronucleus rate, cell cycle and mitotic index were studied. Previous work has proved that Gadd45 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45) gene increases with a dose-effect relationship, and will possibly be a new biological dosimeter to show irradiation damage. So Gadd45 expression is also detected in this study. The micronucleus rate and the expression of Gadd45 alpha gene increased with irradiation dose and were much higher after incubation in the rotating bioreactor than that in the static irradiation group, while the cell proliferation after incubation in the rotating bioreactor decreased at the same time. These results indicate synergetic effects of simulated weightlessness and low dose irradiation in human cells. The cell damage inflicted by gamma-irradiation increased under simulated weightlessness. Our results suggest that during medium- and long-term flight, the human body can be damaged by cumulative low dose radiation, and the damage will even be increased by microgravity in space.

In melanoma, the most aggressive and lethal form of skin cancer, the Brn-2 transcription factor (POU3F2) regulates proliferation and invasiveness and lies downstream from mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Wnt/beta-catenin, two melanoma-associated signaling pathways. In vivo Brn-2 represses expression of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, MITF, to drive cells to a more stem cell-like and invasive phenotype. Given the key role of Brn-2 in regulating melanoma biology, understanding the signaling pathways that drive Brn-2 expression is an important issue. Here, we show that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling reduces invasiveness of melanoma cells in culture and strongly inhibits Brn-2 expression. Pax3, a transcription factor regulating melanocyte lineage-specific genes, directly binds and regulates the Brn-2 promoter, and Pax3 expression is also decreased upon PI3K inhibition. Collectively, our results highlight a crucial role for PI3K in regulating Brn-2 and Pax3 expression, reveal a mechanism by which PI3K can regulate invasiveness, and imply that PI3K signaling is a key determinant of melanoma subpopulation diversity. Together with our previous work, the results presented here now place Brn-2 downstream of three melanoma-associated signaling pathways.

Divergent selection exerted on ecological traits may result in adaptive population differentiation and reproductive isolation and affect differentially the level of genetic divergence along the genome. Genome-wide scan of large sets of individuals from multiple populations is a powerful approach to identify loci or genomic regions under ecologically divergent selection. Here, we focused on the pea aphid, a species complex of divergent host races, to explore the organization of the genomic divergence associated with host plant adaptation and ecological speciation. We analysed 390 microsatellite markers located at variable distances from predicted genes in replicate samples of sympatric populations of the pea aphid collected on alfalfa, red clover and pea, which correspond to three common host-adapted races reported in this species complex. Using a method that accounts for the hierarchical structure of our data set, we found a set of 11 outlier loci that show higher genetic differentiation between host races than expected under the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. Two of the outliers are close to olfactory receptor genes and three other nearby genes encoding salivary proteins. The remaining outliers are located in regions with genes of unknown functions, or which functions are unlikely to be involved in interactions with the host plant. This study reveals genetic signatures of divergent selection across the genome and provides an inventory of candidate genes responsible for plant specialization in the pea aphid, thereby setting the stage for future functional studies.

We introduce the Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics via RNA-seq (SFG), a document intended to serve as an easy-to-follow protocol, walking a user through one example of high-throughput sequencing data analysis of nonmodel organisms. It is by no means an exhaustive protocol, but rather serves as an introduction to the bioinformatic methods used in population genomics, enabling a user to gain familiarity with basic analysis steps. The SFG consists of two parts. This document summarizes the steps needed and lays out the basic themes for each and a simple approach to follow. The second document is the full SFG, publicly available at http://sfg.stanford.edu, that includes detailed protocols for data processing and analysis, along with a repository of custom-made scripts and sample files. Steps included in the SFG range from tissue collection to de novo assembly, blast annotation, alignment, gene expression, functional enrichment, SNP detection, principal components and FST outlier analyses. Although the technical aspects of population genomics are changing very quickly, our hope is that this document will help population biologists with little to no background in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to more quickly adopt these new techniques.

Punctate PPKs are characterized by circumscribed hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles with considerable heterogeneity. In 18 families with autosomal dominant punctate PPK, we report heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in AAGAB, encoding alpha- and gamma-adaptin binding protein p34, located at a previously linked locus at 15q22. alpha- and gamma-adaptin binding protein p34, a cytosolic protein with a Rab-like GTPase domain, was shown to bind both clathrin adaptor protein complexes, indicating a role in membrane trafficking. Ultrastructurally, lesional epidermis showed abnormalities in intracellular vesicle biology. Immunohistochemistry showed hyperproliferation within the punctate lesions. Knockdown of AAGAB in keratinocytes led to increased cell division, which was linked to greatly elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation. We hypothesize that p34 deficiency may impair endocytic recycling of growth factor receptors such as EGFR, leading to increased signaling and cellular proliferation.

Here we show that ventral-to-dorsal hippocampal subdivisions have specific and sequential functions in trial-and-error maze navigation, with ventral hippocampus (vH) mediating early task-specific goal-oriented searching. Although performance and strategy deployment progressed continuously at the population level, individual mice showed discrete learning phases, each characterized by particular search habits. Transitions in learning phases reflected feedforward inhibitory connectivity (FFI) growth occurring sequentially in ventral, then intermediate, then dorsal hippocampal subdivisions. FFI growth at vH occurred abruptly upon behavioral learning of goal-task relationships. vH lesions or the absence of vH FFI growth delayed early learning and disrupted performance consistency. Intermediate hippocampus lesions impaired intermediate place learning, whereas dorsal hippocampus lesions specifically disrupted late spatial learning. Trial-and-error navigational learning processes in naive mice thus involve a stereotype sequence of increasingly precise subtasks learned through distinct hippocampal subdivisions. Because of its unique connectivity, vH may relate specific goals to internal states in learning under healthy and pathological conditions.

NAD(+)-dependent signalling pathways are many and varied, and they regulate fundamental events such as transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and metabolism. Many of these processes have been linked to cancer development. Given that NAD(+)-dependent signalling reactions involve the degradation of the molecule, permanent nucleotide resynthesis through different biosynthetic pathways is crucial for incessant cancer cell proliferation. This necessity supports the targeting of NAD metabolism as a new therapeutic concept for cancer treatment.

In addition, PDGFRA has been recently shown to be rearranged in glioblastoma. However, the frequency, cooccurrence, and clinical value of PDGFRA abnormalities in diffuse gliomas remain unclear. We investigated PDGFRA abnormalities and their clinical impact on 619 primary diffuse gliomas, including 167 grade II, 168 grade III, and 284 grade IV gliomas, with use of BAC-aCGH and validated our findings by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We studied PDGFRA expression using reverse-transcription quantitative PCR in 84 gliomas and 12 non-tumor samples. In 138 samples, we also screened PDGFRA point mutations in exons 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 23; presence of KDR-PDGFRA fusion gene; and PDGFRA truncation. PDGFRA was amplified and gained in 5.2 and 1.9 of samples, respectively. In addition PDGFRA was point-mutated, rearranged, and truncated in 2.9, 0, and 0.7 of cases, respectively. PDGFRA point mutations were observed exclusively in grade IV gliomas and in 12.5 of PDGFRA-amplified tumors. High-level PDGFRA amplification was associated with PDGFRA overexpression, high malignancy grade, and older patient age. Of interest, high-level PDGFRA amplification has an independent negative prognostic value for progression-free survival and overall survival among patients with grade III tumors. PDGFRA is altered through various genetic mechanisms in a subset of high-grade gliomas in patients who might be ideal candidates for PDGFRA inhibitor treatment, and PDGFRA gene amplification could be used as a prognostic biomarker in anaplastic gliomas.

Ethyl acetate extracts (IC50 = 257.081 mu g/ml) were the most active to inhibit the growth of G. intestinalis followed by aqueous extract (PWE), saponins, and n-butanol extract. The PWE and ethyl acetate extract inhibited G. intestinalis trophozoites adherence after 3 h of incubation and killed almost 50 % of the parasite population in a time-dependent manner. Changes in morphology, presence of precipitates in the cytoplasm, dissolved cytoplasm with large vacuole, break of flagella and ventral disk, membrane blebs, and intracellular and nuclear clearance of the treated trophozoites were observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. We demonstrated that P. chinensis induced these changes in G. intestinalis morphology and consequently has potential therapeutic use against giardiasis.

In this way, it is known that mosquito larvae and free-living amoebae (FLA) normally occupy similar aquatic microhabitats. However, few studies have been conducted about such coexistence. For that reason, the objective of the present study was to verify the prevalence of Acanthamoeba spp. in wild populations of Aedes aegypti, as well as to characterize the genotypic lineage, and their possible pathogenicity through thermo- and osmotolerance. Amoebae were investigated in 60 pools, each containing ten larvae of A. aegypti, collected in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). The Acanthamoeba isolates were morphologically characterized and submitted to the polymerase chain reaction technique to confirm identification of the genus. In addition, genotype analyses as well as tests for presumptive pathogenicity in some samples were performed. Of the 60 pools examined, 54 (90 %) were positive for FLA. Of these isolates, 47 (87 %) belonged to the genus Acanthamoeba. The genotypic groups T4, T3 and T5 were identified, numbering 14 (53.8 %), ten (38.5 %) and two (7.7 %) isolates, respectively. The physiological tests performed with 14 strains showed that 12 (85.7 %) were non-pathogenic, while two (14.3 %) were considered as having low pathogenic potential. These results provide a basis for a better understanding of the interaction between these protozoan and mosquitoes in their natural habitat.

It is noted that reductionism, specialisation and modularity are basic prerequisites for understanding life. It is realised that increased progress of scientific biology in elucidating mechanisms at the level of modular components supports the accusation that the more it advances in materialistic description of details, the more it diverts from understanding the innate properties of life. It is clear that modularity, by taking the whole as the sum of its parts, is insufficient for understanding living systems. At the same time, however, there is emergence, as advocated by Robert Laughlin. Emergence after the integration of modules leads to completely new properties of individual organisms as unique unitary entities, and also of systems of organisms with synergistic and antagonistic interactions of the integrated species. The discussion is predominantly based on examples from plant biology. At hierarchically higher scalar levels emergent biological systems are networks integrating species, biotopes, ecosystems and the entire biosphere of Earth, also named Gaia by James Lovelock, in a natural scientific respect. While investigating modules remains essential, biology as a nature science needs to merge and integrate such information to be able to unfold emergence. Through efforts towards visualising and understanding emergent diversity and complexity, the research discipline of biology will provide invaluable contributions to understanding life, and thus refute the accusation that it diverts from embracing the innate properties of life.

Our objective was to investigate: (1) the distribution pattern of flowers in inflorescences of Rhynchospora ciliata; (2) the dynamics of its anthesis; and (3) whether R. ciliata is pollinated by bees, by wind or by both. Additionally, we tested the hypotheses: (i) the hypsophylls and/or anthers attract pollinators, and (ii) biotic vectors enhance the reproductive success of R. ciliata. We analysed floral biology, dynamics of anthesis, frequency and behaviour of insects visiting flowers; we also carried out experiments on flower attractiveness, pollination by wind and reproductive success. Rhynchospora ciliata has flowers with anemophilous attributes, including anthers exposed during anthesis; however, the anthers (here considered a mixed trait) together with the white hypsophylls can be considered as attributes that favour entomophily. Both wind and four species of bee were considered as pollen vectors of R. ciliata. Through flower attractiveness tests, we observed that the hypsophylls do not affect the frequency of pollinating bees and that the absence of exposed anthers affects the average number of visits, probably because pollen is the only floral resource. Reproductive tests indicate that R. ciliata is self-incompatible and that ambophily enhances its reproductive success.

Seed priming is used to induce pre-germinative metabolism and then enhance germination efficiency and crop yields. It has been hypothesized that priming treatments might also improve stress tolerance in germinating seeds, leaving a sort of 'stress memory'. However, the molecular bases of priming still need to be clarified and the identification of molecular indicators of seed vigor is nowadays a relevant goal for the basic and applied research in seed biology. It is generally acknowledged that enhanced seed vigor and successful priming depend on DNA repair mechanisms, activated during imbibition. The complexity of the networks of DNA damage control/repair functions has been only partially elucidated in plants and the specific literature that address seeds remains scanty.

Enzymes participating in biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) and components of JA signaling have been extensively characterized by biochemical and molecular-genetic tools. Mutants have helped to define the pathway for synthesis of jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile), the bioactive form of JA, and to identify the F-box protein COI1 as central regulatory unit. Details on the molecular mechanism of JA signaling were recently unraveled by the discovery of JAZ proteins that together with the adaptor protein NINJA and the general co-repressor TOPLESS form a transcriptional repressor complex. The current model of JA perception and signaling implies the SCFCOI1 complex operating as E3 ubiquitin ligase that upon binding of JA-Ile targets JAZ proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby allowing MYC2 and other transcription factors to activate gene expression. Chemical strategies, as integral part of jasmonate research, have helped the establishment of structure-activity relationships and the discovery of (+)-7-iso-JA-l-Ile as the major bioactive form of the hormone. The transient nature of its accumulation highlights the need to understand catabolism and inactivation of JA-Ile and recent studies indicate that oxidation of JA-Ile by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is the major mechanism for turning JA signaling off. Plants contain numerous JA metabolites, which may have pronounced and differential bioactivity.

We describe a new distribution model that employs machine learning software and geographic information systems to model storm-petrel distribution. We used environmental predictor variables that included newly available climatologies of sea surface DMS concentrations to construct distribution maps of fork-tailed storm-petrel (Oceanodroma furcata) and Leach's storm-petrel (O. leucorhoa) in the North Pacific and Bering Sea. Model accuracy was assessed by (1) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values and (2) comparing predicted distributions to presence and non-detection data from two opportunistic pelagic surveys performed in summer 2008. Models using all predictor variables gave AUC values of 0.89 and 0.75, sensitivity values of 0.73 and 0.61, and specificity values of 0.83 and 0.73 for fork-tailed and Leach's storm-petrel, respectively.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that folate confers a modest protection against CRC risk. However, the relationship is complex, and evidence from human intervention trials and animal studies suggests that a high-dose of folic acid supplementation may enhance the risk of colorectal carcinogenesis in certain circumstances. The molecular mechanisms underlying the apparent dual modulatory effect of folate on colorectal carcinogenesis are not fully understood. Folate is central to C-1 metabolism and is needed for both DNA synthesis and DNA methylation, providing plausible biological mechanisms through which folate could modulate cancer risk. Aberrant DNA methylation is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis and is typically associated with the transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Folate is required for the production of S-adenosyl methionine, which serves as a methyl donor for DNA methylation events; thereby folate availability is proposed to modulate DNA methylation status. The evidence for an effect of folate on DNA methylation in the human colon is limited, but a modulation of DNA methylation in response to folate has been demonstrated. More research is required to clarify the optimum intake of folate for CRC prevention and to elucidate the effect of folate availability on DNA methylation and the associated impact on CRC biology.

By proliferating and mechanically interacting with each other, cells can build complex organization such as tissues that ultimately organize into even more complex multicellular living organisms, such as mammals, composed of billions of single cells interacting with each other. As opposed to passive materials, living cells actively respond to the mechanical perturbations occurring in their environment. Tissue cell adhesion to its surrounding extracellular matrix or to neighbors is an example of a biological process that adapts to physical cues. The adhesion of tissue cells to their surrounding medium induces the generation of intracellular contraction forces whose amplitude adapts to the mechanical properties of the environment. In turn, solicitation of adhering cells with physical forces, such as blood flow shearing the layer of endothelial cells in the lumen of arteries, reinforces cell adhesion and impacts cell contractility. In biological terms, the sensing of physical signals is transduced into biochemical signaling events that guide cellular responses such as cell differentiation, cell growth and cell death. Regarding the biological and developmental consequences of cell adaptation to mechanical perturbations, understanding mechanotransduction in tissue cell adhesion appears as an important step in numerous fields of biology, such as cancer, regenerative medicine or tissue bioengineering for instance. Physicists were first tempted to view cell adhesion as the wetting transition of a soft bag having a complex, adhesive interaction with the surface. But surprising responses of tissue cell adhesion to mechanical cues challenged this view. This, however, did not exclude that cell adhesion could be understood in physical terms. It meant that new models and descriptions had to be created specifically for these biological issues, and could not straightforwardly be adapted from dead matter. In this review, we present physical concepts of tissue cell adhesion and the unexpected cellular responses to mechanical cues such as external forces and stiffness sensing. We show how biophysical approaches, both experimentally and theoretically, have contributed to our understanding of the regulation of cellular functions through physical force sensing mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the different physical models that could explain how tissue cell adhesion and force sensing can be coupled to internal mechanosensitive processes within the cell body.

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) allows us to employ the whole Bayesian formalism to problems where we can use simulations from a model, but cannot evaluate the likelihood directly. When summary statistics of real and simulated data are compared-rather than the data directly-information is lost, unless the summary statistics are sufficient. Sufficient statistics are, however, not common but without them statistical inference in ABC inferences are to be considered with caution. Previously other authors have attempted to combine different statistics in order to construct (approximately) sufficient statistics using search and information heuristics. Here we employ an information-theoretical framework that can be used to construct appropriate (approximately sufficient) statistics by combining different statistics until the loss of information is minimized. We start from a potentially large number of different statistics and choose the smallest set that captures (nearly) the same information as the complete set. We then demonstrate that such sets of statistics can be constructed for both parameter estimation and model selection problems, and we apply our approach to a range of illustrative and real-world model selection problems.

The derivation of validated ESCs lines is a necessary step if the generation of economically relevant transgenic animals is to be achieved. However, this is still elusive, as the isolation of true ESCs lines for livestock has not been accomplished to date. It has been demonstrated that by forced expression of a defined set of transcription factors, it is possible to reprogram somatic cells to cells that closely resemble an ES-like state. These cells were termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We introduce the basic concepts relating to stem cell biology and give an overview of the various attempts to isolate and generate pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from species relevant to livestock production. Further, we point out the issues to be addressed and hurdles to be overcome to realize the promise of stem cells in agriculture. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This makes them a promising cell of choice for studying a variety of biological processes, toxicity assays, biomaterial-cell interaction studies, as well as in tissue-engineering applications. In this study, we report the generation of two clones of SV40-immortalized EPCs from umbilical cord blood. These cells retained most of the functional features of mature endothelial cells and showed no indication of senescence after repeated culture for more than 240 days. Extensive functional characterization of the immortalized cells by western blot, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence studies substantiated that these cells retained their ability to synthesize nitric oxide, von Willebrand factor, P-Selectin etc. These cells achieved unlimited proliferation potential subsequent to inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, but failed to form colonies on soft agar. We also show their enhanced growth and survival on vascular biomaterials compared to parental cultures in late population doubling. These immortalized EPCs can be used as a cellular model system for studying the biology of these cells, gene manipulation experiments, cell-biomaterial interactions, as well as a variety of tissue-engineering applications.

Although a basal rate of glucose metabolism occurs in all cells, the processing rates of glucose can become dramatically enhanced when cells acquire malignant properties, or remain undifferentiated. This article investigates the consequences of how increased glucose metabolism affects cellular physiology by altering the physicochemical properties of the whole metabolic network. As a result, enhanced lactate production in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect) is required, and metabolism is consequently reconfigured, through multiple mechanisms, to confer numerous physiological and possibly regulatory properties to cells.

Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression is increased and facilitates lactate production in cancer cells. Modulation of PKM2 catalytic activity also regulates the synthesis of DNA and lipids that are required for cell proliferation, and of NADPH that is required for redox homeostasis. In addition to its role as a pyruvate kinase, PKM2 also functions as a protein kinase and as a transcriptional coactivator. These biochemical activities are controlled by allosteric regulators and post-translational modifications of PKM2 that include acetylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, prolyl hydroxylation, and sumoylation. Given its pleiotropic effects on cancer biology, PKM2 represents an attractive target for cancer therapy.

An Ecological Critique,"Abstract: The energy and material flows of a city are often described as urban metabolism (UM), which is put forward as a way to link a city's ecology and economy. UM draws parallels to the biology of individual organisms, yet the analogy is misapplied. In striving to be interdisciplinary, UM makes this organismic comparison rather than identifying the city as an ecosystem, thereby ignoring developments in ecological theory. Using inappropriate rhetoric misdirects researchers, which influences scientific investigation-from problem statements to interpretations. UM is valuable in quantifying the city's use of natural resources but does not achieve a comprehensive, integrated analysis of the urban ecosystem. To realize an interdisciplinary, perhaps transdisciplinary, understanding of urban ecology, researchers need to emphasize the essential tenets of material flows analysis, view the city as an ecosystem, and use language that properly reflects current knowledge, theory, and conceptual frameworks in the foundational disciplines.

","Abstract: Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health problem in developing countries. Some studies also implicate a suboptimal vitamin A intake in certain parts of the population of the industrialized world. Provitamin A carotenoids such as beta-carotene are the major source for retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives) in the human diet. However, it is still controversial how much beta-carotene intake is required and safe. An important contributor to this uncertainty is the lack of knowledge about the biochemical and molecular basis of beta-carotene metabolism. Recently, key players of provitamin A metabolism have been molecularly identified and biochemically characterized. Studies in knockout mouse models showed that intestinal beta-carotene absorption and conversion to retinoids is under negative feedback regulation that adapts this process to the actual requirement of vitamin A of the body. These studies also showed that in peripheral tissues a conversion of beta-carotene occurs and affects retinoid-dependent physiologic processes. Moreover, these analyses provided a possible explanation for the adverse health effects of carotenoids by showing that a pathologic accumulation of these compounds can induce oxidative stress in mitochondria and cell signaling pathways related to disease. Genetic polymorphisms in identified genes exist in humans and also alter carotenoid homeostasis. Here, the advanced knowledge of beta-carotene metabolism is reviewed, which provides a molecular framework for understanding the role of this important micronutrient in health and disease.

In this study, the development, nymphal and adult feeding, adult behavior, and mate encounter mechanisms of this species are investigated. This species inhabits a stream flowing through a cave, in darkness and at a constant temperature. Nymphs of different sizes cohabit throughout the whole year, showing a nonseasonal life cycle. Nymphs at the entrance of the cave feed mainly on coarse particulate organic matter and hyphae, and nymphs at the end of the cave feed principally on detritus and occasionally on animal matter. Adults were present year-round and aggregated on emergent stones at the end of the cave. No drumming signals were recorded; therefore, this species seems to rely mainly on aggregation to maximize pair encounters. As shown in this study, P. gevi have adaptations suited to life in the dark and the completion of its entire life cycle inside a cave.

We examined the impact of sibling fusion on ontogenetic shifts in offspring size in the brooding sea anemone Urticina felina. Fusion occurred among brood-protected embryos in U. felina, whereas it occurred postrelease among settlers of corals studied here and previously. Two fusion products were evidenced: morphologically aberrant offspring and large homogeneous offspring coined ""megalarvae."" The frequent occurrence (similar to 77%) of megalarvae identifies them as the primary fusion product, which drove an increase in offspring size and within-clutch size variation before release. Lipid signatures suggest that morphologically aberrant juveniles represent by-products that do not reach adulthood. Not only were occurrences of megalarvae common in the populations studied, they increased with maternal fecundity, suggesting that sibling fusion may be a form of kin cooperation integral to the reproductive success of U. felina, warranting investigation in other live-bearing invertebrate taxa.

However, standardized measurement techniques are needed.

Aim: This study compared three techniques for segmental analysis (T1, conventional electrode measurement; T2, use of a novel additional switching unit; T3, equipotentials instead of switching unit) which are often used in population biology.

Subjects and methods: The techniques were compared in 124 healthy adults (19-83 years) using a tetrapolar bioimpedance analyser (Nutriguard-M) at multiple frequencies (5, 50, 100 kHz) to gain whole-body and segmental resistances, reactances and phase angles.

Results: Repeated measures ANOVA yielded a significant technique effect for most variables (26/27), a significant interaction technique x sex for half (13/27), and a significant interaction technique x age for a quarter (7/27) of variables.

Conclusions: Differences exist between the three techniques which are primarily caused by inconsistent current pathways. A comparison with literature data showed that, in addition, subject's posture during measurement, electrode contact and electrode site may lead to inconsistent resistance and reactance values. This makes comparisons between different populations difficult. Therefore, this study recommends generally using the T2 technique which is standardized, easy to use and, thereby, well suited for field studies in large population groups.

IDOL expression is controlled at the transcriptional level by the cholesterol-sensing nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR). In response to rising cellular sterol levels, activated LXR induces IDOL production, thereby limiting further uptake of exogenous cholesterol through the LDLR pathway. The LXR-IDOL-LDLR mechanism for feedback inhibition of cholesterol uptake is independent of and complementary to the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway. Since the initial description of the LXR-IDOL pathway, biochemical studies have helped to define the structural basis for both IDOL target recognition and LDLR ubiquitin transfer. Recent work has also suggested links between IDOL and human lipid metabolism. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2012;32:2541-2546.)

Methods and Results-Thrombin, a G protein-coupled receptor agonist, activated Pyk2 in a time-dependent manner and inhibition of its stimulation attenuated thrombin-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Thrombin also activated Grb2-associated binder protein 1, p115 Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rac1, RhoA, and p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) and interference with stimulation of these molecules attenuated thrombin-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. In addition, adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant negative Pyk2 inhibited thrombin-induced Grb2-associated binder protein 1, p115 rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rac1, RhoA and Pak1 stimulation. Balloon injury also caused activation of Pyk2, Grb2-associated binder protein 1, p115 rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rac1, RhoA, and Pak1 in the carotid artery of rat, and these responses were sensitive to inhibition by the dominant negative Pyk2. Furthermore, inhibition of Pyk2 activation resulted in reduced recruitment of smooth muscle cells onto the luminal surface and their proliferation in the intimal region leading to suppression of neointima formation.

Conclusion-Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that Pyk2 plays a crucial role in G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell growth and migration, as well as balloon injury-induced neointima formation.

Here, we investigate the role of Krev interaction-trapped 1 (KRIT1), an adherens junction accessory protein required for cell-cell junction stability, in regulating these vascular functions.

Methods and Results-Krit1(+/-) mice exhibited an enhanced edematous response to the complex inflammatory stimuli found in the passive K/BxN model of inflammatory arthritis and the murine air pouch model, yet leukocyte infiltration was unchanged. Correspondingly, reduced KRIT1 expression increased baseline arteriole and venule permeability 2-fold over that of wild-type littermates, as measured by intravital microscopy of the intact cremaster muscle vascular network, but this increase was not accompanied by increased leukocyte extravasation or activation. Direct stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced increased permeability in wild-type mice, but surprisingly no increase over baseline levels was observed in Krit1(+/-) mice, despite extensive leukocyte activation. Finally, adoptive transfer of Krit1(+/-) bone marrow failed to increase permeability in wild-type mice. However, reduced expression of KRIT1 in the hematopoietic lineage dampened the differences observed in baseline permeability.

Conclusion-Taken together, our data indicate an integral role for KRIT1 in microvessel homeostasis and the vascular response to inflammation. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2012;32:2702-2710.)

Tianzhu White yak is a unique breed developed from a very small number of mutant founders and its white hair has a special niche market value. In this study, the genetic polymorphisms in Tyrosinase (TYR) gene, which has been considered as a 'albino locus' in cattle, were identified and characterized to search for alleles associated with the white coat colour in yak. A total of 973 yak samples were collected, including 438 animals from five nucleus breeding herds and 365 individuals from four reproductive herds of the Tianzhu White yak. The reference TYR genomic DNA sequence derived from a Hereford bull was used to design all primers for screening and sequencing the exon 2 and the last partial 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the yak TYR gene. Both PCR-SSCP analysis and DNA sequences for their complete exon 2 in selected samples from the Tianzhu White yak herds and black yak populations identified a single conserved sequence identical to other cattle breeds. There were 14 genotypes and seven alleles defined by nucleotide polymorphisms present in the 215 bp long 5'-UTR of yak TYR gene among all yak samples, of which five alleles were specific to yak while the other two alleles were of a cattle origin. Although, current data Suggested no association of these polymorphisms with the yak coat colour variations, they shed light on the potential function of the promoter on regulation of expression of yak TYR gene that is warranted to screen for additional polymorphisms in its extended 5'-UTR and other exons.

Polymeric chains assembled from covalently-linked Ub monomers function as molecular signals in the regulation of a host of cellular processes. Our previous studies have shown that the predominant state of Lys48-linked di- and tetra-Ub chains at near-physiological conditions is a closed conformation, in which the Ub-Ub interface is formed by the hydrophobic surface residues of the adjacent Ub units. Because these very residues are involved in (poly)Ub interactions with the majority of Ub-binding proteins, their sequestration at the Ub-Ub interface renders the closed conformation of polyUb binding incompetent. Thus the existence of open conformation(s) and the interdomain motions opening and closing the Ub-Ub interface is critical for the recognition of Lys48-linked polyUb by its receptors. Knowledge of the conformational properties of a polyUb signal is essential for our understanding of its specific recognition by various Ub-receptors. Despite their functional importance, open states of Lys48-linked chains are poorly characterized. Here we report a crystal structure of the open state of Lys48-linked di-Ub. Moreover, using NMR, we examined interactions of the open state of this chain (at pH4.5) with a Lys48-linkage-selective receptor, the UBA2 domain of a shuttle protein hHR23a. Our results show that di-Ub binds UBA2 in the same mode and with comparable affinity as the closed state. Our data suggest a mechanism for polyUb signal recognition, whereby Ub-binding proteins select specific conformations out of the available ensemble of polyUb chain conformations.

Here, it is argued that cellular life involves (i) inevitable accumulation of damage resulting from imperfectness and heterogeneity of every cellular process, and (ii) dilution of damage when cells divide. While severe damage is cleared by protective systems, milder damage can only be diluted. This is due to the high cost of accuracy, the greater number of damage forms compared to protective systems, and the constraints on cellular life inherited from the prokaryotic world. This strategy also applies to cancer cells, which are particularly dependent on damage dilution. Imposing restriction on cell division necessarily leads to aging. Interventions that extend lifespan act through metabolic reprogramming, thereby changing both damage composition and the rate of damage accumulation. Thus, heterogeneity leading to myriad mild damage forms represents the cause of aging, whereas the processes that affect the damage landscape and damage accumulation are lifespan regulators.

Here we aim at developing small chimeric proteins, displaying the extracellular ligand-binding motifs of a human GPCR, the Y receptor. This allows the study of ligand-receptor interactions in simplified systems. We present comprehensive information on the use of transmembrane (OmpA) and soluble (Blc) beta-barrel scaffolds. Whereas Blc appeared to be not fully compatible with our approach, owing to problems with refolding of the hybrid constructs, loop-grafted versions of OmpA delivered encouraging results. Previously, we described a chimeric construct based on OmpA displaying all three extracellular Y1 receptor loops in different topologies and showing moderate affinity to one of the natural ligands. Now, we present detailed data on the interaction of these constructs with several Y receptor ligands along with data on new constructs. Our findings suggest a common binding mode for all ligands, which is mediated through the C-terminal residues of the peptide ligand, supporting the functional validity of these hybrid receptors.

Twenty-two reciprocally monophyletic sister-species pairs were identified: 64% were allopatric, and the remainder were sympatric. Age of divergence was similar for allopatric and sympatric species pairs. Sympatric sister pairs displayed greater divergence in morphology, ecology, and sexually dimorphic colour patterns than did allopatric pairs, suggesting that both genetic drift in allopatric species pairs and ecologically adaptive divergence between members of sympatric pairs have played a role in diversification. Basal species typically have small geographical ranges and are restricted to geographically and ecologically peripheral reef habitats. We found little evidence that a single dominant process has driven diversification, nor did we detect a pattern of discrete, sequential stages of diversification in relation to habitat, ecology, and reproductive biology.

Such cells can use a number of cell behaviors including contractility, proliferation, and directed movement to create these structures. By contrast, tissue engineers and researchers in regenerative medicine seeking to produce organs for repair or replacement therapy can combine cells with synthetic polymeric scaffolds. Tissue engineers try to achieve these goals by shaping scaffold geometry in such a way that cells embedded within these scaffold self-assemble to form a tissue, for instance aligning to synthetic fibers, and assembling native extracellular matrix to form the desired tissue-like structure. Although self-assembly is a dominant process that guides tissue assembly both within the embryo and within artificial tissue constructs, we know little about these critical processes.

In the mature vasculature, different blood flow regimes induce distinct genetic programs, and significant progress has been made toward understanding how these forces are perceived by endothelial cells and transduced into biochemical signals. However, it cannot be assumed that paradigms that govern the mature vasculature are pertinent to the developing embryonic vasculature. The embryonic vasculature can respond to the mechanical forces of blood flow, and these responses are critical in vascular remodeling, certain aspects of sprouting angiogenesis, and maintenance of arterial-venous identity. Here, we review data regarding mechanistic aspects of endothelial cell mechanotransduction, with a focus on the response to shear stress, and elaborate upon the multifarious effects of shear stress on the embryonic vasculature. In addition, we discuss emerging predictive vascular growth models and highlight the prospect of combining signaling pathway information with computational modeling.

Understanding how these differences arise requires knowing how they are generated in the embryo. Growing evidence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) suggests that morphological differences between species result largely from changes in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression during development. Corresponding changes in functional cellular behaviors (morphogenetic mechanisms) are only beginning to be explored, however. Here we show that spatiotemporal patterns of tissue contractility are sufficient to explain differences in morphology of the early embryonic brain between disparate species. We found that enhancing cytoskeletal contraction in the embryonic chick brain with calyculin A alters the distribution of contractile proteins on the apical side of the neuroepithelium and changes relatively round cross-sections of the tubular brain into shapes resembling triangles, diamonds, and narrow slits. These perturbed shapes, as well as overall brain morphology, are remarkably similar to those of corresponding sections normally found in species such as zebrafish and Xenopus laevis (frog). Tissue staining revealed relatively strong concentration of F-actin at vertices of hyper-contracted cross-sections, and a finite element model shows that local contraction in these regions can convert circular sections into the observed shapes. Another model suggests that these variations in contractility depend on the initial geometry of the brain tube, as localized contraction may be needed to open the initially closed lumen in normal zebrafish and Xenopus brains, whereas this contractile machinery is not necessary in chick brains, which are already open when first created. We conclude that interspecies differences in cytoskeletal contraction may play a larger role in generating differences in morphology, and at much earlier developmental stages, in the brain than previously appreciated.

Expression of the normally repressed L1 retrotransposons has been shown to induce genome instability by creating DNA double-stranded breaks and chromosomal rearrangements through the process of retrotransposition. At present, little is known about the expression of L1-encoded ORF1p and ORF2p which are indispensable for its retrotransposition activity. Given its potentially harmful effects on the genome, we investigated the implications of both ORF1p and ORF2p expression and their subcellular localization in a range of breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissues including 15 normal breast tissues, 25 fibroadenomas, 25 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 95 invasive cancers. Clinicopathologic parameters and survival outcomes were investigated in association with the cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of ORF1p and ORF2p using univariate and multivariate analysis. High cytoplasmic expression of ORF1p and ORF2p was seen in DCIS tumors, but they were not related with survival outcome. The majority of invasive cancers were found to express both ORF1p and ORF2p in the cytoplasm, while nuclear expression was also seen in a subclass of those invasive cancers in the range of 28-31 %. Tumors with high nuclear expression of ORF1p and ORF2p were more significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.001) and the worst patient survival (p < 0.0001) than those with cytoplasmic expression. This is the first study examining the effects of both ORF1p and ORF2p expression in breast cancer tissues. Our observation shows altered expression patterns of ORF1p and ORF2p within invasive cancers, which are related to differences in overall patient survival. The differing patterns of both cytoplasmic and nuclear ORF1p and ORF2p expression indicate that further studies of the biology and function of L1 retrotransposons are required in breast cancer.

The Framingham study and others that followed could show that HDL-C is an independent cardiovascular risk factor and that the increase of HDL-C of only 10 mg center dot L-1 leads to a risk reduction of 23%. While statin therapy and therefore low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction could lower coronary heart disease considerably; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality still occur in a significant portion of subjects already receiving therapy. Therefore, new strategies and therapies are needed to further reduce the risk. Raising HDL-C was thought to achieve this goal. However, established drug therapies resulting in substantial HDL-C increase are scarce and their effect is controversial. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that HDL particle functionality is at least as important as HDL-C levels since HDL particles not only promote reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery (mainly macrophages) to the liver but also exert pleiotropic effects on inflammation, haemostasis and apoptosis. This review deals with the biology of HDL particles, the established and future therapeutic options to increase HDL-C and discusses the results and conclusions of the most important studies published in the last years. Finally, an outlook on future diagnostic tools and therapeutic opportunities regarding coronary artery disease is given.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, 22-25 nucleotides, endogenously expressed noncoding RNA. miRNAs are important genetic regulators: one miRNA can possibly target multiple genes and they can function as tumor promoters (oncogenic miRNAs, oncomirs) or tumor suppressors (anti-oncomirs). Therefore, the identification of misregulated miRNAs in cellular signaling pathways related to oncogenesis can have profound implications for cancer therapy. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) converts epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a normal embryological process that frequently get activated during cancer invasion and metastasis. Recent evidence also supports the presence of a small subset of self-renewing, stem-like cells within the tumor mass that possess the capacity to seed new tumors and they have been termed 'cancer stem cells (CSC)'. Conceivably, these CSCs could provide a resource for cells that cause therapy resistance. Although the cell origin of CSCs remains to be fully elucidated, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that the biology of EMT and CSCs is tightly linked with the sequences and compositions of miRNA molecules. Therefore, targeting miRNAs involved in EMT and CSCs regulation can provide novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies in oncology.

The most common form of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. A diagnostic biomarker for Graves' disease is the presence of immunoglobulins which bind to, and stimulate, the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). We hypothesized that the ectopically expressed TSHR gene in a thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) assay could be engineered to increase the accumulation of the GPCR pathway second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP), the molecule measured in the assay as a marker for pathway activation. An ectopically expressing TSHR-mutant guanine nucleotide-binding protein, (GNAS) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell clone was constructed using standard molecular biology techniques. After incubation of the new clone with sera containing various levels of TSI, GPCR pathway activation was then quantified by measuring cAMP accumulation in the clone. The clone, together with a NaCl-free cell assay buffer containing 5% polyethylene glycol (PEG)6000, was tested against 56 Graves' patients, 27 toxic thyroid nodule patients and 119 normal patients. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, when comparing normal with Graves' sera, the assay yielded a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 99% and an efficiency of 98%. Total complex precision (within-run, across runs and across days), presented as a percentage coefficient of variation, was found to be 7.8, 8.7 and 7.6% for low, medium and high TSI responding serum, respectively. We conclude that the performance of the new TSI assay provides sensitive detection of TSI, allowing for accurate, early detection of Graves' disease.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is the first discovered retrovirus causing malignancy in human. HTLV infection affects host's ocular tolerance and causes various diseases in the eye. Here we discuss the manifestations, mechanisms, treatments, and future directions of HTLV-related ocular diseases.

Recent finings

Recent serological researches showed that the number of HTLV-1 carriers in metropolitan area was increasing, although seroprevalence of HTLV-1 in general population was decreased after screening serological tests in blood donors started. The most common clinical entity of uveitis was still HTLV-1 uveitis in HTLV-1 highly endemic area, but prevalence of HTLV-1 uveitis varies in different parts of the world. As for treatment of inflammation, tacrolimus and 5-azacytidine were reported to be effective for autoimmune manifestations in HTLV-1-related overlap syndrome (deratomyositis/Sjogren's syndrome) and HTLV-1-related myelodysplastic syndrome. Interleukin-2 receptor targeted therapies improved scleritis in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma caused by HTLV-1. Basic researches identified that HTLV-1 tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor play critical roles in the HTLV-1-related disease and are now being investigated as targeted therapies.

Summary

Development of modern molecular biology makes it possible to reveal deep insights of HTLV-1-related ocular diseases. Although effective therapies based on basic researches have been reported, further endeavor is necessary to establish much more specific treatments of the ocular diseases.

At a recent Company of Biologists Workshop held at Steyning's historic Wiston House, thirty researchers led by John Gurdon interrogated three central questions: how are cell type-specific programs generated, what mechanisms duplicate this programmatic information as cells divide, and how does epigenetics contribute to trans-generational inheritance?

Here, we report the characterization of a Klf4 homologue in Xenopus laevis during embryogenesis. Klf4 is transcribed both maternally and zygotically and the transcript is ubiquitous in embryos during germ-layer formation. Klf4 promotes endoderm differentiation in both Nodal/Activin-dependent and -independent manners. Moreover, Klf4 regulates anteroposterior body axis patterning via activation of a subset of genes in the Spemann organizer, such as Noggin, Dkk1 and Cerberus, which encode Nodal, Wnt and BMP antagonists. Loss of Klf4 function leads to the failure of germ-layer differentiation, the loss of responsiveness of early embryonic cells to inducing signals, e. g. Nodal/Activin, and the loss of transcription of genes involved in axis patterning. We conclude that Klf4 is required for germ-layer differentiation and body axis patterning by means of rendering early embryonic cells competent to differentiation signals.

Besides direct clearance, hydrological alterations, climatic changes or insect infestations, chemical pollution could be a significant contributor of mangrove degradation. The present paper reviews the current knowledge on the occurrence, bioavailability and toxic effects of trace contaminants in mangrove ecosystems. The literature confirmed that trace metals, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) and Endocrine Disrupters Compounds (EDCs) have been detected in various mangrove compartments (water, sediments and biota). In some cases, these chemicals have associated toxic effects on mangrove ecosystem species, with potential impact on populations and biodiversity in the field. However, nearly all studies about the bioavailability and toxic effects of contaminants in mangrove ecosystems focus on selected trace metals, PAHs or some ""conventional"" POPs, and virtually no data exist for other contaminant groups. The specificities of mangrove ecosystems (e.g. biology, physico-chemistry and hydrology) support the need for specific ecotoxicological tools. This review highlights the major data and methodological gaps which should be addressed to refine the risk assessment of trace pollutants in mangrove ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, two proteins involved in vascular calcification; serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and tumour necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) have emerged as potentially useful biomarkers. OPG levels are positively correlated with CV risk, whereas TRAIL levels show a negative correlation. Exercise training is known to reduce risk factors for CV disease by improving metabolism, vascular biology and blood flow. This study examined the effects of a 6-month exercise training programme on levels of OPG and TRAIL. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured for comparative purposes. Materials and methods Overweight and obese patients undertook a 6-month exercise programme. Patients participated in 4 h of primarily aerobic exercise per week of which 2 h were supervised. At the beginning and end of the programme, anthropometric measurements, PWV and serum levels of OPG, TRAIL and hsCRP were measured. Results A total of 21 patients (17 men) aged 55.2 +/- 10 years completed the programme. Mean body mass index decreased from 34.1 +/- 5.8 to 32.6 +/- 5.4 kg/m2 (P < 0.05), while waist circumference decreased from 111.8 +/- 12.4 to 109.6 +/- 12.8 cm (P < 0.05). PWV decreased from 9.2 to 8.5 m/s (P < 0.02). OPG, TRAIL and hsCRP levels did not change significantly. Conclusions Exercise training reduced PWV but not OPG, TRAIL or hsCRP in this population. These data suggest that while an intervention of this nature improves vascular tone, it does not exert significant effects on serum biomarkers related to atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification.

Given the complex functional interdependencies between cellular components, a disease is seldom the consequence of a defect in a single gene product, instead reflecting the perturbations of a group of closely related gene products that carry out specific functions together. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore how the community of protein complexes impacts disease associations. Here, by integrating a large amount of information from protein complexes and the cellular basis of diseases, we built a human disease network in which two diseases are linked if they share common disease-related protein complex. A systemic analysis revealed that linked disease pairs exhibit higher comorbidity than those that have no links, and that the stronger association two diseases have based on protein complexes, the higher comorbidity they are prone to display. Moreover, more connected diseases tend to be malignant, which have high prevalence. We provide novel disease associations that cannot be identified through previous analysis. These findings will potentially provide biologists and clinicians new insights into the etiology, classification and treatment of diseases.

One such hypothesis is that intraspecific hybridization can facilitate invasions because hybrids express higher phenotypic mean and/or variance than their parents. We tested this hypothesis using the parasitoid wasp Psyttalia lounsburyi, a candidate biocontrol agent for the olive fly Bactrocera oleae. Under laboratory conditions, we found marked differentiations between two populations of wasps, from South Africa and Kenya, in terms of life history strategies. South African females were better reproducers than Kenyan females, but the opposite was observed for males. Reaction norms showed different effects of developmental temperature on fecundity depending on the genotype. However, neither heterosis nor hybrid breakdown were observed. Hence, in this system, sex-specific effects of hybridization and genotype-by-environment interactions jeopardize any straightforward prediction on the fitness of hybrids. Therefore, our paper contributes to tone down the hybrid advantage hypothesis in invasion biology.

Using this method, the specific amino acid turnover rates between proteins and the pool of free amino acids were determined for eight different amino acids (alanine, valine, proline, aspartic acid, glycine, leucine, isoleucine, and threonine) in two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (CEN.PK 113-7D and YSBN2). Furthermore, proteasome activities were compared for both strains. Both results confirmed the hypothesis of a higher protein turnover rates in CEN.PK 113-7D, which was generated in a previous comparative systems biology study of these two yeast strains. The ATP costs associated with the observed differences in protein turnover were quantified and could explain accurately the differences in biomass yield between both strains that are observed in chemostat cultures. The percentage of maintenance ATP associated with protein polymerization (polymerization for growth and re-polymerization because of turnover) and degradation was estimated to be 72% for YSBN2 and 79% for CEN.PK 113-7D, which makes these processes the dominant nonbiosynthetic drain of ATP in living cells, and hence, it represents an energetic parameter of great relevance.

To compare clinico-pathologic variables and protein expression of potential regulatory components in patients who develop type II endometrial cancer with and without antecedent tamoxifen.

Methods. Clinico-pathologic variables were compared for all surgically staged patients (2000-2008) with grade 3 endometrioid, papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma of the uterus based on tamoxifen exposure [Tam (+) vs. Tam (-)]. Overall survival was analyzed using a multivariable Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier estimates. Protein expression of ER alpha, PR, mTOR, p-mTOR, IGF-1R, EGFR, VEGF and HER-2/neu was compared by immunohistochemistry using a semiquantitative scoring system.

Results. Of 115 patients with high grade endometrial cancers, 15 received tamoxifen. These patients were older at diagnosis than Tam (-) patients. A higher percentage of Tam (+) patients had carcinosarcoma compared to Tam (-) patients (60% vs. 30%, P=0.038). Overall survival for Tam (+) patients was shorter than Tam (-) patients (16.6 vs. 32.2 months, P=0.004). The hazard ratio for death for Tam (+) patients was 2.53 (P=0.014), controlling for age and stage. Intensity and extent of staining were similar for ER alpha, PR, VEGF, EGFR, p-mTOR and HER-2/neu. The average expression score for ICF-1R and mTOR in the Tam (+) group was significantly higher than the Tam (-) group: 10.3 vs 7.0, P=0.001 and 6.0 vs 3.1, P=0.029, respectively.

Conclusion. There are differences in the biology of type II endometrial cancers that develop in women with prior tamoxifen exposure. Tamoxifen associated cancers show higher expression of IGF-1R and mTOR, which should be further investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Wolbachia strain (wInn) naturally infecting Drosophila innubila induces male killing, while native strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans usually induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). In this study, we transferred wInn to D. melanogaster and D. simulans by embryonic microinjection, expecting conservation of the male-killing phenotype to the novel hosts, which are more suitable for genetic analysis. In contrast to our expectations, there was no effect on offspring sex ratio. Furthermore, no CI was observed in the transinfected flies. Overall, transinfected D. melanogaster lines displayed lower transmission rate and lower densities of Wolbachia than transinfected D. simulans lines, in which established infections were transmitted with near-perfect fidelity. In D. simulans, strain wInn had no effect on fecundity and egg-to-adult development. Surprisingly, one of the two transinfected lines tested showed increased longevity.

Crucial in managing the disease is not only lowering arterial blood pressure but also preventing or treating the typical end-organ damage caused by long-lasting and inadequately treated hypertension. In the past decade, it has been shown that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in several hypertension-related pathologies, such as cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, hypertensive heart failure, renal fibrosis, kidney failure, and, to a lesser extent, eye disease and hemorrhagic stroke. Whereas others extensively reviewed the role of miRs in atherosclerosis and vascular disease, this review focuses on their role in target organ damage during arterial hypertension. We emphasize the involvement of miRs in pathological end-organ remodeling processes and try to demonstrate some common miR signatures in distinct end organs. Hence, we aimed to provide proof of arterial hypertension being a systemic disease, similar to diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, miRs that act on one particular process in different end organs are interesting therapeutic targets.

Here we review and contextualize our contributions, which have emphasized the influence of structural changes and molecular flexibility. A repeated observation is the presence of conformational melding, in which the T-cell receptor (TCR), peptide, and in some cases, MHC protein cooperatively adjust in order for recognition to proceed. The structural changes reflect the intrinsic dynamics of the unligated proteins. Characterization of the dynamics of unligated TCR shows how binding loop motion can influence TCR cross-reactivity as well as specificity towards peptide and MHC. Examination of peptide dynamics indicates not only peptide-specific variation but also a peptide dependence to MHC flexibility. This latter point emphasizes that the TCR engages a composite peptide/MHC surface and that physically the receptor makes little distinction between the peptide and MHC. Much additional evidence for this can be found within the database of available structures, including our observations of a peptide dependence to the TCR binding mode and structural compensations for altered interatomic interactions, in which lost TCR-peptide interactions are replaced with TCR-MHC interactions. The lack of a hard-coded physical distinction between peptide and MHC has implications not only for specificity and cross-reactivity but also the mechanisms underlying MHC restriction as well as attempts to modulate and control TCR recognition.

The structure of the IL-7/IL-7Ra complex teaches that interfaces between the ?c interleukins and their receptors can vary in size, polarity, and specificity, and that significant conformational changes might be necessary for complexes of interleukins and their receptors to bind the shared, activating ?c receptor. Binding, kinetic, and thermodynamic studies of IL-7 and IL-7Ra show that glycosylation and electrostatics can be important to interactions between interleukins and their receptor, even where the glycans and charged residues are distant from the interface.

Despite the ease with which electronic documents would permit the incorporation of this information into citation-based document search and retrieval systems, the possibilities of repeated citations remain untapped. Part of this under-utilization may be due to the fact that very little is known regarding the pattern of repeated citations in scholarly literature or how this pattern may vary as a function of journal, academic discipline or self-citation. The current research addresses these unanswered questions in order to facilitate the future incorporation of repeated citation information into document search and retrieval systems. Using data mining of electronic texts, the citation characteristics of nine different journals, covering the three different academic fields (economics, computing, and medicine & biology), were characterized. It was found that the frequency (f) with which a reference is cited Nor more times within a document is consistent across the sampled journals and academic fields. Self-citation causes an increase in frequency, and this effect becomes more pronounced for large N.

In this article, we highlight recent examples of how computational, mathematical, and experimental tools can be combined to ultimately answer the questions posed in one of the grand challenges in organismal biology: ""Integrating living and physical systems."".

The goal of this workshop was to foster an ongoing discussion by the community on how to effectively train students from the biological, physical, engineering, and mathematical sciences to work at the intersection of these fields. One major point of discussion centered on how to be a successful interdisciplinary researcher in terms of where to publish, how to successfully write grants, and how to navigate evaluations for tenure and promotion. An emphasis was placed on the importance of developing strong multidisciplinary collaborations and clearly defining one's career trajectory to the home discipline. Another focus of the discussion was on the training of students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary work and helping these junior researchers to launch their careers. The group emphasized the need for the development of publicly available resources for biologists to learn basic tools for mathematical modeling and for mathematicians and engineers to see how their fields may be applied to current topics in the life sciences.

In the present study, two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry were used to resolve and identify proteins from five tissues: skeletal muscle, liver, brain, heart, and gill. Of 864 protein features excised from 2D gels, 424 proteins were identified, corresponding to a 49% identification rate. For any given tissue, several protein features were identified as the same protein, resulting in a total of 254 nonredundant proteins. These nonredundant proteins were categorized into a total of 11 molecular functions, including catalytic activity, structural molecule, binding, and transport. In all tissues, catalytic activity and binding were the most highly represented molecular functions. Comparing across the tissues, proteome coverage was lowest in skeletal muscle, due to a combination of a low number of gel spots excised for analysis and a high redundancy of identifications among these spots. Nevertheless, the identification of a substantial number of proteins with high statistical confidence from other tissues suggests that F. grandis may serve as a model fish for future studies of environmental proteomics and ultimately help to elucidate proteomic responses of fish and other vertebrates to environmental stress.

To delineate the global metabolism of HNSCC, we report H-1 NMR-based metabolic profiling of HNSCC cells from five different patients that were derived from various sites of the upper aerodigestive tract, including the floor of mouth, tongue and larynx. Primary cultures of normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) from three different donors were used for comparison. H-1 NMR spectra of polar and non-polar extracts of cells were used to identify more than thirty-five metabolites. Principal component analysis performed on the NMR data revealed a clear classification of NHOK and HNSCC cells. HNSCC cells exhibited significantly altered levels of various metabolites that clearly revealed dysregulation in multiple metabolic events, including Warburg effect, oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, TCA cycle anaplerotic flux, glutaminolysis, hexosamine pathway, osmo-regulatory and anti-oxidant mechanism. In addition, significant alterations in the ratios of phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine, and elevated arachidonic acid observed in HNSCC cells reveal an altered membrane choline phospholipid metabolism (MCPM). Furthermore, significantly increased activity of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), particularly cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) observed in all the HNSCC cells confirm an altered MCPM. In summary, the metabolomic findings presented here can be useful to further elucidate the biological aspects that lead to HNSCC, and also provide a rational basis for monitoring molecular mechanisms in response to chemotherapy. Moreover, cPIA(2) may serve as a potential therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapy of HNSCC. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In a previous report (Del Prete et al., 2008) we showed that, after differentiation. DC exhibited increased number of condensed mitochondria and dynamic changes in their energy metabolism. A study is presented here showing that the DC differentiation process is characterized by increased expression level and activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, as well as by an increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Moreover, DC are equipped with more efficient antioxidant protection systems, over expressed most likely to detoxify increased ROS production, as a consequence of the much higher mitochondrial activity. Kinetic analysis of the three main mitochondrial biogenesis-associated genes revealed that the peak in PPAR gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1 alpha) gene expression was suddenly reached few hours after the onset of the differentiation. While PGC-1 alpha expression rapidly declines, the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-I) expression gradually increased. These findings demonstrate that an active mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during DC differentiation and further suggest that an early input by the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC-1 alpha is needed to trigger the subsequent activation of the downstream transcription factors, NRF-1 and TFAM in this process.

Such scientific strides highlight the potential of replacing or repairing damaged tissues in congenital abnormalities, diseases, or injuries, as well as constructing functional tissue or organs in vivo. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of differentiating into bone-forming cells, they constitute an appropriate cell source to repair damaged bone tissues. In addition, the immunoregulatory property of MSCs provides a foundation for their use in treating a variety of autoimmune diseases. However, the interaction between MSCs and immune cells in cell-based tissue regeneration is largely unknown. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of MSC-based tissue regeneration, emphasizing the role of the immune microenvironment in bone regeneration. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There is, however, a dearth of such inducible systems in Myxococcus xanthus, a well-studied prokaryotic model for multicellular development, cell differentiation, motility, and light response and a promising source of secondary metabolites. The few available systems have limitations, and exogenously based ones are unavailable. Here, we describe two new, versatile inducible systems for conditional expression of genes in M. xanthus. One employs isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) as an inducer and is inspired by those successfully applied in some other bacteria. The other requires vanillate as an inducer and is based on the system developed originally for Caulobacter crescentus and recently adapted for mammalian cells. Both systems are robust, with essentially no expression in the absence of an inducer. Depending on the inducer and the amounts added, expression levels can be modulated such that either system can conditionally express genes, including ones that are essential and are required at high levels such as ftsZ. The two systems operate during vegetative growth as well as during M. xanthus development. Moreover, they can be used to simultaneously induce expression of distinct genes within the same cell. The conditional expression systems we describe substantially expand the genetic tool kit available for studying M. xanthus gene function and cellular biology.

This three-credit hour course was focused on laboratory skills and was designed to reinforce and develop the students' laboratory techniques and problem-solving skills, as well as to give encouragement to participate in a summer research project. This skills course consisted of a lecture section with team-based laboratory rotations of five-weeks each. Most students in the rotations had the opportunity to work in both biology and chemistry laboratories. The skills course culminated in several students being chosen to continue research in the summer with a research stipend while under the direction of one of the faculty mentors. The summer research projects were all collaborative efforts between chemists and biologists. Data are provided from voluntary entrance and exit student surveys to determine students' overall skill levels and interests before and after completion of the skills course. This course was valuable in encouraging students to become involved in and committed to research, for teaching them laboratory techniques, and for helping them evolve into independent researchers.

During terminal differentiation of the epidermal keratinocytes, the nucleus undergoes a programmed transformation from active status, associated with execution of the genetic programs of cornification and epidermal barrier formation, to a fully inactive condition and becomes a part of the keratinized cells of the cornified layer. Tremendous progress achieved within the past two decades in understanding the biology of the nucleus and epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression allowed defining several levels in the regulation of cell differentiation-associated gene expression programs, including an accessibility of the gene regulatory regions to DNA-protein interactions, covalent DNA and histone modifications, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as higher-order chromatin remodeling and nuclear compartmentalization of the genes and transcription machinery. Here, we integrate our current knowledge of the mechanisms controlling gene expression during terminal keratinocyte differentiation with distinct levels of chromatin organization and remodeling. We also propose directions to further explore the role of epigenetic mechanisms and their interactions with other regulatory systems in the control of keratinocyte differentiation in normal and diseased skin.

Like for many somatic tissues, isolation of a nearly pure population of stem cells is a primary goal in cutaneous biology. We used a quantitative transplantation assay, using injection of keratinocytes into subcutis combined with limiting dilution analysis, to assess the long-term repopulating ability of putative murine EpiSC populations. Putative EpiSC populations were isolated by FACS sorting. The CD133(+) population and the subpopulation of CD133(+) cells that exhibits high mitochondrial membrane potential (D Psi m(hi)) were enriched for long-term repopulating EpiSCs versus unfractionated cells (3.9- and 5.2-fold, respectively). Evidence for self-renewal capacity was obtained by serial transplantation of long-term epidermal repopulating units derived from CD133(+) and CD133(+) Delta Psi m(hi) keratinocytes. CD133(+) keratinocytes were multipotent and produced significantly more hair follicles than CD133(-) cells. CD133(+) cells were a subset of the previously described integrin alpha 6(+)CD34(+) bulge cell population, and 28.9 +/- 8.6% were label-retaining cells. Thus, murine keratinocytes within the CD133(+) and CD133(+) Delta Psi m(hi) populations contain EpiSCs that regenerate the epidermis for the long term, are self-renewing, multipotent, and label-retaining cells.

Evolutionary theories suggest that men's more violent nature derives in part from their historically greater need to compete over access to potential mates. The current research investigates this link between mating and male violence and provides rigorous experimental evidence that mating motives cause men to behave violently toward other men. In these studies, men and women were primed with a mating motive and then performed a noise-blast aggression task. Being primed with mating led men, but not women, to deliver more painful blasts of white noise to a same-sex partner (but not an opposite-sex partner). This effect was particularly pronounced among men with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation, for whom competition over access to new mates is an especially relevant concern. Findings also suggest that mating-induced male violence is motivated by a desire to assert one's dominance over other men: when men were given feedback that they had won a competition with their partner (and thus had achieved dominance through nonaggressive means), the effect of the mating prime on aggression was eliminated. These findings provide insight into the motivational roots of male aggression and illustrate the value of testing theories from evolutionary biology with rigorous experimental methods.

The image charges are obtained either by a least square fitting between the potential of unknown images and the exact reaction potential (for the layered media or cylindrical region) or by a Prony fitting to the Fourier transform of the exact potential (layered media only) and a Sommerfeld-type identity, which yields the locations and strengths of the image charges. Next, combining the results for the two geometries, the image charge approximation for the reaction potential, due to a charge inside an ion-channel model, is obtained, which accounts for the polarization of the region outside the ion-channel (consisting of a membrane and electrolyte solutions below and above). Such an approximation to the reaction field in the ion-channel model can be used for an explicit/implicit hybrid treatment of electrostatics interaction in modeling ion-channels. Numerical tests show that the proposed method has an attractive performance in computing electrostatic interactions of source charges inside the ion-channel model via a simple summation of pairwise interactions among source and image charges.

Rocky Mountain Biological Stations in the Early Twentieth Century,"Abstract: Biological field stations proliferated in the Rocky Mountains region of the western United States during the early decades of the twentieth century. This essay examines these Rocky Mountain field stations as hybrid lab-field sites from the perspective of the field side of the dichotomy: as field sites with raised walls rather than as laboratories whose walls with the natural world have been lowered. Not only were these field stations transformed to be more like laboratories, but they were also embedded within the particular regional environmental and institutional context of the Rocky Mountains. Using the University of Colorado's Mountain Laboratory at Tolland and other contemporaneous sites as examples, this essay analyzes key features of these sites, including their location within transportation networks, buildings, equipment, personnel, scheduling, recreational and social activities, and other material and social practices on the ground. Considering both the distinctive and shared characteristics of the Rocky Mountain field stations in comparison to other types of field stations provides a more complete picture of the diversity and range of lab-field hybrid sites in the biological sciences in the early twentieth-century United States.

Hastings became a center for field biology on the West Coast, and by 1960 it was serving as a model for the creation of additional U.C. reserves. Today, the U.C. Natural Reserve System (NRS) is the largest and most diverse network of university-based biological field stations in the world, with 36 sites covering more than 135,000 acres. This essay examines the founding of the Hastings Reservation, and asks how it managed to grow and develop, in the 1940s and 1950s, during a time of declining support for natural history research. It shows how faculty and staff courted the support of key institutional allies, presented themselves as the guardians of a venerable tradition in nature study, and emphasized the station's capacity to document ecological change and inform environmental policy and management. In the years since, Hastings and other U.C. reserves have played crucial roles in California environmental politics. Biological field stations in the post-war era deserve more attention not only from historians of biology, but also from environmental historians and other scholars interested in the role of science in society.

Recent reports of long-term prostate cancer outcomes stratified by Gleason score based on the 2005 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) update suggest that important aspects of the biology of prostate cancer correlate with commonly available histopathological information. In this review we present a conceptual framework for the possible existence of distinct but interrelated developmental pathways in the context of the Gleason score in considering various biological and clinical aspects of prostate cancer. This may be useful in characterizing prostate cancer as an indolent condition in some and an aggressive disease in others, in decision making for treatment, and in the interpretation of the biological course and treatment outcomes.

Materials and Methods: A comprehensive review of clinical, pathological and investigational biological literature on this topic was conducted. In addition, the biological behavior of prostate cancer as interpreted from this survey was compared to that of other solid neoplasms in developing a schema for characterizing the pathogenesis of various forms of the disease.

Results: The Gleason scoring system has been found to have fundamental value in predicting the behavior of prostate cancer and assessing outcomes of its treatment. Increasingly, the proportion of Gleason pattern 4 in a prostatectomy specimen is being recognized as a critical factor in predicting the rates of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality. Under the current Gleason classification, a Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 cancer carries a minimal long-term risk of progression or mortality. Risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality increases with increasing proportions of the Gleason 4 component in the prostatectomy specimen, from 3 + 3 = 6 with tertiary 4 (ie less than 5% of a 4 component) to 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 3 = 7 and 4 + 4 = 8. Assuming that the Gleason 4 component increases in volume more rapidly with time than well differentiated components, it can be inferred that a smaller proportion of Gleason 4 could mean that the cancer has been identified at an earlier phase in the natural history of the disease. This could explain the improved prognosis on the basis of length and lead time biases, and conceivably on the basis of a decreased likelihood of cancer cells having metastasized. Correspondingly, increasing amounts of Gleason 4 cancer in a prostate specimen might be explained in 2 ways, as the preferential growth of a single clone of Gleason 4 cells, possibly with intraprostatic spread, or the evolution of Gleason 3 cancer cells to become Gleason 4. These hypotheses have been examined by genetic analysis of metastatic deposits and by comparisons of multiple foci of cancer within individual prostates. The clinical significance of these concepts in regard to disease status at diagnosis, treatment selection, outcomes of treatment, and implications for future research on the basis of clinical and molecular observations are the basis of the developmental schemata we propose.

Conclusions: Given the relatively benign nature of homogeneous, low volume Gleason 3 tumors, and the progressive risk of biochemical recurrence and prostate cancer specific mortality with increasing quantities of Gleason 4 components, we propose that Gleason 4 (and 5) cancers constitute cancer diatheses distinct from that of Gleason 3 cancer. This distinction may contribute to the understanding of the prognosis intrinsic to these biological behavioral patterns, and help guide the translation of findings at molecular and histological levels to a more precise selection of treatments.

However, dynamic tracer imaging can provide considerably more information about in vivo biology by delineating both the temporal and spatial pattern of tracer uptake. In addition, several potential sources of error that occur in static imaging can be mitigated. This review focuses on the application of dynamic PET imaging to measuring regional cancer biologic features and especially in using dynamic PET imaging for quantitative therapeutic response monitoring for cancer clinical trials. Dynamic PET imaging output parameters, particularly transport (flow) and overall metabolic rate, have provided imaging end points for clinical trials at single-center institutions for years. However, dynamic imaging poses many challenges for multicenter clinical trial implementations from cross-center calibration to the inadequacy of a common informatics infrastructure. Underlying principles and methodology of PET dynamic imaging are first reviewed, followed by an examination of current approaches to dynamic PET image analysis with a specific case example of dynamic fluorothymidine imaging to illustrate the approach.

These are so highly diverse in sequence and distribution, they are essentially considered as species-specific. However, we have recently shown the presence of homologous effectors in fungal species of the Dothideomycetes class. One such example is Ecp2, an effector originally described in the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum but later detected in the plant pathogenic fungi Mycosphaerella fijiensis and Mycosphaerella graminicola as well. Here, using in silico sequence-similarity searches against a database of 135 fungal genomes and GenBank, we extend our queries for homologs of Ecp2 to the fungal kingdom and beyond, and further study their history of diversification. Our analyses show that Ecp2 homologs are members of an ancient and widely distributed superfamily of putative fungal effectors, which we term Hce2 for Homologs of C. fulvum Ecp2. Molecular evolutionary analyses show that the superfamily originated and diversified within the fungal kingdom, experiencing multiple lineage-specific expansions and losses that are consistent with the birth-and-death model of gene family evolution. Newly formed paralogs appear to be subject to diversification early after gene duplication events, whereas at later stages purifying selection acts to preserve diversity and the newly evolved putative functions. Some members of the Hce2 superfamily are fused to fungal Glycoside Hydrolase family 18 chitinases that show high similarity to the Zymocin killer toxin from the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, suggesting an analogous role in antagonistic interactions. The observed high rates of gene duplication and loss in the Hce2 superfamily, combined with diversification in both sequence and possibly functions within and between species, suggest that Hce2s are involved in adaptation to stresses and new ecological niches. Such findings address the need to rationalize effector biology and evolution beyond the perspective of solely host-microbe interactions.

In previous work we identified the glucosyltransferase UgtP as a division inhibitor responsible for increasing the size of Bacillus subtilis cells under nutrient-rich conditions. In nutrient-rich medium, UgtP is distributed more or less uniformly throughout the cytoplasm and concentrated at the cell poles and/or the cytokinetic ring. Under these conditions, UgtP interacts directly with FtsZ to inhibit division and increase cell size. Conversely, under nutrient-poor conditions, UgtP is sequestered away from FtsZ in punctate foci, and division proceeds unimpeded resulting in a reduction in average cell size. Here we report that nutrient-dependent changes in UgtP's oligomerization potential serve as a molecular rheostat to precisely co-ordinate B.?subtilis cell size with nutrient availability. Our data indicate UgtP interacts with itself and the essential cell division protein FtsZ in a high-affinity manner influenced in part by UDP glucose, an intracellular proxy for nutrient availability. These findings support a model in which UDP-glc-dependent changes in UgtP's oligomerization potential shift the equilibrium between UgtP center dot UgtP and UgtP center dot FtsZ, fine-tuning the amount of FtsZ available for assembly into the cytokinetic ring and with it cell size.

For example, the detection of reliable phenotypegenotype associations and molecular signatures of selection requires a detailed knowledge about genome-wide patterns of allele frequency variation, linkage disequilibrium and recombination. We resequenced 16 genomes of the model tree Populus trichocarpa and genotyped 120 trees from 10 subpopulations using 29 213 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Significant geographic differentiation was present at multiple spatial scales, and range-wide latitudinal allele frequency gradients were strikingly common across the genome. The decay of linkage disequilibrium with physical distance was slower than expected from previous studies in Populus, with r(2) dropping below 0.2 within 36 kb. Consistent with this, estimates of recent effective population size from linkage disequilibrium (N-e approximate to 4000-6000) were remarkably low relative to the large census sizes of P. trichocarpa stands. Fine-scale rates of recombination varied widely across the genome, but were largely predictable on the basis of DNA sequence and methylation features. Our results suggest that genetic drift has played a significant role in the recent evolutionary history of P. trichocarpa. Most importantly, the extensive linkage disequilibrium detected suggests that genome-wide association studies and genomic selection in undomesticated populations may be more feasible in Populus than previously assumed.

Despite this, little is known about the detailed ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation due to the scarce number of controlled experimental surveys. The speciesarea relationship, a fundamental concept in ecology, requires the understanding of the fragmentation effects in a long term perspective, which turns this task even harder. Here we address the spatial patterns of species distribution in fragmented landscapes, assuming a neutral community model. We study the species area relationship and how its shape changes as the landscape becomes more fragmented. Recent investigations, based on extensive computer simulation, have contributed to establish some definite conclusions in the study of non-fragmented landscapes: the existence of a three-regime or two-regime scenario for the speciesarea relationship, the emergence of a power-law regime at intermediate scales and the augment of the speciesarea exponent z with the speciation rate. Despite the recent efforts, some other questions remain, such as the dependence of z in the whole range of the speciation rate. Questions like these are currently debated but generalizations cannot be drawn. This is the first paper, to our knowledge, that uses the coalescence method and neutral theory to examine biodiversity on more complex spatial structures. Our simulation results corroborate that the fragmentation plays a crucial role in shaping the speciesarea relationship, by determining the existence and extension of the power-law regime associated with small and intermediate areas. On the other hand, when individuals are allowed to disperse over longer distances the speciesarea relationship now displays the classic triphasic pattern, and the intermediate regime, which is well described by a power-law, is established even for highly fragmented landscapes.

Early diagnosis remains a significant problem in the clinical treatment of OS as we remain far from a comprehensive understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms and the biology involved. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), a large family of small non-coding RNAs, may provide a greater understanding of OS as they play a complex role in gene expression regulation in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, the differential expression profiles of miRNAs between OS and osteoblast cell lines were investigated by miRNA microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). A total of 268 miRNAs were identified that were significantly dysregulated in OS compared with the osteoblast cell line, including miR-9, miR-99, miR-195, miR-148a and miR-181a, which had been validated as overexpressed, and miR-143, miR-145, miR-335 and miR-539, which were confirmed to be downregulated. This differential expression may aid future OS diagnosis and prognosis prediction and illustration of the potential mechanisms in the oncogenesis, development and metastasis of OS. Bioinformatic research on these differentially expressed miRNAs suggests that they are able to regulate the biological behaviors of OS in a complex and effective manner. Further study on the function. of these miRNAs is likely to provide new insights into OS biology and treatment.

In squash fruit and other high water content crops, the grinding of tissue with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen fails to produce a homogeneous and fine powered sample desirable to ensure a good penetration of the extraction reagent. Objective To develop an improved pulverisation method to facilitate the homogenisation process of squash fruit tissue prior to RNA extraction without reducing quality and yield of the extracted RNA. Methodology Three methods of pulverisation, each followed by the same extraction protocol, were compared. The first approach consisted of the lyophilisation of the sample in order to remove the excess of water before grinding, the second one used a cryogenic mill and the control one a mortar grinding of frozen tissue. The quality of the isolated RNA was tested by carrying out a quantitative real time downstream amplification. Results In the three situations considered, mean values for A(260)/A(280) indicated minimal interference by proteins and RNA quality indicator (RQI) values were considered appropriate for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) amplification. Successful qRT-PCR amplifications were obtained with cDNA isolated with the three protocols. Conclusion Both apparatus can improve and facilitate the grinding step in the RNA extraction process in zucchini, resulting in isolated RNA of high quality and integrity as revealed by qRT-PCR downstream application. This is apparently the first time that a cryogenic mill has been used to prepare fruit samples for RNA extraction, thereby improving the sampling strategy because the fine powder obtained represents a homogeneous mix of the organ tissue.

The same tight regulation applies to essential organelles that can both sustain cell survival or promote self-degradation programs. Mitochondria are perhaps the prime example of cellular machineries with split functions (personalities). As a main source of ATP, mitochondria represent the main powerhouse of eukaryotic cells. However, mitochondrial respiration has the hidden complication of the production of potentially harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, mitochondria holds an armamentarium of stress-response factors, which depending on the context, may lead to pro-inflammatory signals, and to various forms of cell death, ranging from apoptosis to necrosis. A main clearance mechanism to eliminate superfluous, damaged or hyperactive mitochondria is selective mitophagy. Mitophagy, in fact, is emerging as a key quality-control mechanism in cancer cells. Specifically, malignant transformation has been found to induce marked changes in mitochondrial dynamics and structure. Moreover, a key hallmark of tumor progression is metabolic reprogramming, which further deregulates ROS content and renders cells more susceptible to mitochondrial perturbations. Despite its increasing relevance in cancer biology, the field of mitophagy remains virtually unexplored in melanoma. However, given unique antioxidant mechanisms in melanocytic cells (e.g., linked to melanin) and the idiosyncratic interplay between ROS and hypoxia (both mitophagy inducers) in melanoma, this tumor type represents an ideal scenario for physiological studies of mitochondrial turnover. This perspective summarizes proof of concept for in-depth basic and translational studies of mitophagy in melanoma. Particular emphasis is dedicated to new opportunities for gene discovery and drug design in this still aggressive disease.

We summarize recent findings on the function and rewiring of central carbon metabolism in melanoma. Metabolic profiling studies using stable isotope tracers show that glycolysis is decoupled from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This decoupling is not dysfunction but rather an alternate wiring required by tumor cells to remain metabolically versatile. In large part, this requirement is met by glutamine feeding the TCA cycle as an alternative source of carbon. Glutamine is also used in non-conventional ways, like traveling in reverse through the TCA flux to feed fatty acid biosynthesis. Biosynthetic networks linked with non-essential amino acids alanine, serine, arginine, and proline are also significantly impacted by the use of glutamine as an alternate carbon source.

However, there are difficulties in obtaining cell lines from adult human intestine, such as microbial contamination of cultures from the tissue samples, short life span of enterocytes, overgrowth of mesenchymal cells, etc. Various model used to obtain adult intestinal cell lines are very complex requiring use of feeder layer or gel matrices. The aim of this study was to establish a novel method for the simple and reproducible isolation of human enterocytes. Enterocytes were isolated from SI samples (n = 5) obtained from cadaveric donors using a mechanical procedure, and separation with immunomagnetic beads coated with anti-EpCAM antibodies. Light and electron microscopy, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry techniques were used to characterize the isolated cells. Immunohistochemical staining of normal SB biopsies confirmed that the cell cultures maintained an in vivo phenotype as reflected in cytokeratin expression CK18, CK20 and expression of intestine-specific markers such as sucrase isomaltase and maltase glucoamylase. Furthermore, the cells strongly expressed TLR-5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 and several molecules such as CD40, CD86, CD44, ICAM-1 and HLA-DR which are important in triggering cell-mediated immune responses.

Despite this, consensus with respect to the definition, causes or solutions is lacking, making obesity a prominent knowledge controversy. In this article, I argue that the Barker hypothesis, a theory of foetal development, can support the redistribution of expertise necessary to address this knowledge controversy. A vast scientific literature confirms its argument that many diseases can be traced to the conditions for development in utero determined by the commingling of temporally and spatially complex processes. The Barker hypothesis does not support solely reductionist, biophysiological paradigms of health and disease, but rather evinces complex understandings that span biology, social positionality, place and generation. I argue that this makes the hypothesis significant for transdisciplinary studies of health and disease, and prompts consideration beyond the conventional bounds of epidemiology to new sites of understanding and action that may support movements concerned with body politics and justice for fat people. I point to literature on the potential for injustice engendered by the Barker hypothesis, and suggest that these critiques reveal the very necessity for transdisciplinary collaboration on obesity in the first place.

The search for a reliable marker to identify these CSCs is ongoing as current markers, like CD44 and CD133, are more broadly expressed and therefore are not highly selective and currently also lack function in CSC biology. Here, we analyzed whether the Wnt target Lgr5, which has earlier been identified as a marker for murine intestinal stem cells, could potentially serve as a functional marker for CSCs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based detection of Lgr5, using three newly developed antibodies, on primary colorectal tumor cells revealed a clear subpopulation of Epcam+Lgr5+ cells. Similarly, primary CRC-derived spheroid cultures, known to be enriched for CSCs, contain high levels of Lgr5+ cells, which decrease upon in vitro differentiation of these CSCs. Selection of the Lgr5high CRC cells identified the clonogenic fraction in vitro as well as the tumorigenic population in vivo. Finally, we confirm that Lgr5 expression is dependent on the Wnt pathway and show that Lgr5 overexpression induces clonogenic growth. We thus provide evidence that Lgr5 is, next to a functional intestinal stem cell marker, a selective marker for human colorectal CSCs.

The biochemical regulation of axon myelination via the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) has been characterized extensively. However, most biochemical analysis has been conducted in vitro on OPCs adhered to substrata of stiffness that is orders of magnitude greater than that of the in vivo CNS environment. Little is known of how variation in mechanical properties over the physiological range affects OPC biology. Here, we show that OPCs are mechanosensitive. Cell survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation capacity in vitro depend on the mechanical stiffness of polymer hydrogel substrata. Most of these properties are optimal at the intermediate values of CNS tissue stiffness. Moreover, many of these properties measured for cells on gels of optimal stiffness differed significantly from those measured on glass or polystyrene. The dependence of OPC differentiation on the mechanical properties of the extracellular environment provides motivation to revisit results obtained on nonphysiological, rigid surfaces. We also find that OPCs stiffen upon differentiation, but that they do not change their compliance in response to substratum stiffness, which is similar to embryonic stem cells, but different from adult stem cells. These results form the basis for further investigations into the mechanobiology of cell function in the CNS and may specifically shed new light on the failure of remyelination in chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Based on the facts that (i) mammary stem/progenitor cells (MaSC) are proposed to be the driving forces behind mammary growth and function and (ii) variation exists between mammalian species with regard to physiological and pathological functioning of this organ, we believe that studying MaSC from different mammals is of great comparative interest. Over the years, important data has been gathered on MaSC of men and mice, although knowledge on MaSC in other mammals remains limited. Therefore, the aim of this work was to isolate and characterize MaSC from the mammary gland of horses. Hereby, our salient findings were that the isolated equine cells met the 2 in vitro hallmark properties of stem cells, namely the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. Moreover, the cells were immunophenotyped using markers for CD29, CD44, CD49f, and Ki67. Finally, we propose the mammosphere assay as a valuable in vitro assay to study MaSC during different physiological phases since it was observed that equine lactating mammary gland contains significantly more mammosphere-initiating cells than the inactive, nonlactating gland (a reflection of MaSC self-renewal) and, moreover, that these spheres were significantly larger in size upon initial cultivation (a reflection of progenitor cell proliferation). Taken together, this study not only extends the current knowledge of mammary gland biology, but also benefits the comparative approach to study and compare MaSC in different mammalian species.

There is currently no available treatment for disease caused by these toxin-producing bacteria, and understanding the biology of the Shiga toxins might be instrumental in addressing this issue. In target cells, the toxins efficiently inhibit protein synthesis by inactivating ribosomes, and they may induce signaling leading to apoptosis. To reach their cytoplasmic target, Shiga toxins are endocytosed and transported by a retrograde pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum, before the enzymatically active moiety is translocated to the cytosol. The toxins thereby serve as powerful tools to investigate mechanisms of intracellular transport. Although Shiga toxins are a serious threat to human health, the toxins may be exploited for medical purposes such as cancer therapy or imaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PTM at multiple sites on a protein creates a combinatorial explosion in the number of potential mod-forms, or global patterns of modification. Distinct mod-forms can elicit distinct downstream responses, so that the overall response depends partly on the effectiveness of a particular mod-form to elicit a response and partly on the stoichiometry of that mod-form in the molecular population. We introduce the mod-form distributionthe relative stoichiometries of each mod-formas the most informative measure of a protein's state. Distinct mod-form distributions may summarize information about distinct cellular and physiological conditions and allow downstream processes to interpret this information accordingly. Such information encoding by PTMs may facilitate evolution by weakening the need to directly link upstream conditions to downstream responses. Mod-form distributions provide a quantitative framework in which to interpret ideas of PTM codes that are emerging in several areas of biology, as we show by reviewing examples of ion channels, GPCRs, microtubules, and transcriptional co-regulators.

The ability to visualize matter at these scales in a TEM is largely due to the efforts made in correcting for the imperfections in the lens systems which introduce aberrations and ultimately limit the achievable spatial resolution. In addition to the progress made in increasing the spatial resolution, the TEM has become an all-in-one characterization tool. Indeed, most of the properties of a material can be directly mapped in the TEM, including the composition, structure, bonding, morphology, and defects. The scope of applications spans essentially all of the physical sciences and includes biology.

Until recently, however, high resolution visualization of structural changes occurring on sub-millisecond time scales was not possible. In order to reach the ultrashort temporal domain within which fundamental atomic motions take place, while simultaneously retaining high spatial resolution, an entirely new approach from that of millisecond-limited TEM cameras had to be conceived. As shown below, the approach is also different from that of nanosecond-limited TEM, whose resolution cannot offer the ultrafast regimes of dynamics. For this reason ""ultrafast electron microscopy"" is reserved for the field which is concerned with femtosecond to picosecond resolution capability of structural dynamics.

In conventional TEMs, electrons are produced by heating a source or by applying a strong extraction field. Both methods result In the stochastic emission of electrons, with no control over temporal spacing or relative arrival time at the specimen. The timing issue can be overcome by exploiting the photoelectric effect and using pulsed lasers to generate precisely timed electron packets of ultrashort duration. The spatial and temporal resolutions achievable with short intense pulses containing a large number of electrons, however, are limited to tens of nanometers and nanoseconds, respectively. This is because Coulomb repulsion is significant in such a pulse, and the electrons spread in space and time, thus limiting the beam coherence. It Is therefore not possible to image the ultrafast elementary dynamics of complex transformations. The challenge was to retain the high spatial resolution of a conventional TEM while simultaneously enabling the temporal resolution required to visualize atomic-scale motions.

In this Account, we discuss the development of four-dimensional ultrafast electron microscopy (4D UEM) and summarize techniques and applications that illustrate the power of the approach. In UEM, images are obtained either stroboscopically with coherent single-electron packets or with a single electron bunch. Coulomb repulsion is absent under the single-electron condition, thus permitting imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy, all with high spatiotemporal resolution, the atomic scale (sub-nanometer and femtosecond). The time resolution is limited only by the laser pulse duration and energy carried by the electron packets; the CCD camera has no bearing on the temporal resolution. In the regime of single pulses of electrons, the temporal resolution of picoseconds can be attained when hundreds of electrons are in the bunch.

The applications given here are selected to highlight phenomena of different length and time scales, from atomic motions during structural dynamics to phase transitions and nanomechanical oscillations. We conclude with a brief discussion of emerging methods, which include scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (S-UEM), scanning transmission ultrafast electron microscopy (ST-UEM) with convergent beams, and time-resolved imaging of biological structures at ambient conditions with environmental cells.

The authors aimed to develop a gene expression signature in synovial tissue that could enrich clinical response of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients to rituximab.

Methods The authors studied synovial gene expression using high-throughput quantitative real-time-PCR in 20 RA patients who underwent arthroscopy before and after treatment with rituximab. Several objective approaches were used to explore patterns in the data and to find genes associated with changes in disease activity due to treatment.

Results This analysis revealed two patient populations associated with distinct clinical, laboratory and histological features and, importantly, showed enrichment for response (60% non-responders vs 90% responders). A composite baseline gene score (GS) correlated with change in disease activity score (Delta DAS) between baseline and month 3 (r=0.74, p=0.0002), but also with Delta DAS at later time-points (month 9, r=0.54, p=0.016; month 15, r=0.45, p=0.06; month 21, r=0.72, p=0.003). Notably, the GS significantly correlated with baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.69, p=0.0008), but not with other DAS components. The GS genes represented T cell, macrophage, remodelling and interferon-a biology. Responders demonstrated higher expression of macrophage and T cell genes, while non-responders showed higher expression of interferon-alpha and remodelling genes.

Conclusions This study reveals a baseline synovial GS that correlates with early and late clinical responses to rituximab. The GS biology suggests that T cells and macrophages are important for response to B cell depleting therapy, while expression of remodelling and interferon-alpha genes correlates with poor response.

Here, site-directed mutants having one of the mutations RAS2(Lys77), RAS2(Tyr112), and ERG5(Pro370) were constructed and evaluated. The mutants were also combined with overexpression of PGM2, earlier proved as a beneficial target for galactose utilization. The constructed strains were analyzed for their gross phenotype, transcriptome and targeted metabolites, and the results were compared to those obtained from reference strains and the evolved strains. The RAS2(Lys77) mutation resulted in the highest specific galactose uptake rate among all of the strains with an increased maximum specific growth rate on galactose. The RAS2(Tyr112) mutation also improved the specific galactose uptake rate and also resulted in many transcriptional changes, including ergosterol metabolism. The ERG5(Pro370) mutation only showed a small improvement, but when it was combined with PGM2 overexpression, the phenotype was almost the same as that of the evolved mutants. Combination of the RAS2 mutations with PGM2 overexpression also led to a complete recovery of the adaptive phenotype in galactose utilization. Recovery of the gross phenotype by the reconstructed mutants was achieved with much fewer changes in the genome and transcriptome than for the evolved mutants.

It is widely believed that environmental degradation of streams and rivers may facilitate susceptibility to invasion; however, this has not yet been demonstrated consistently across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We analyzed macroinvertebrate data from 398 stream and river sites in Germany in order to test whether morphologically and physicochemically degraded stream and river habitats are more prone to invasion. Further, we identified the most important environmental variables facilitating invasion. The study confirmed that invaded sites were significantly more degraded than sites where only indigenous species were recorded. In both streams and rivers, invaded sites featured increased maximum temperatures, chloride and total organic carbon concentrations and a decreased morphological habitat quality. In streams, additionally the variables minimum temperature, oxygen, orthophosphate and ammonium contributed to greater degradation. In rivers also nitrate concentration was increased at invaded sites. Generalized linear models indicated that chloride was one of the most important variables that favored invasibility in both streams and rivers. In streams, the most indicative variables for invasion risk also included orthophosphate and maximum temperature. In rivers, in addition to chloride, morphological habitat quality was important.

Further, we investigated which locations are vulnerable to future establishment using geospatial data (1,075 native and 124 invasive records) in a Maxent model developed with data from the Worldclim database. We found introductions of X. laevis to be continuous over the last 50 years and invasions to be ongoing on four continents: Asia, Europe, North and South America. Invasion pathways were related to scientific use and the pet trade, with high rates of deliberate release followed by a lag of 2-25 years to first reports. No populations were found to be declining although some have been extirpated. Optimal uninvaded bioclimatic space was identified in central Mexico and southern Australia, while larger suitable areas were found in southern South America and southwestern Europe. Xenopus laevis is a cryptic invasive species that is likely to increase its invasive distribution, through new introductions and by the spread of ongoing invasions. Many more invasive populations are likely to exist than are currently recognised and reducing invasive potential will largely rely on education of those involved with their captive care.

This complexity can be seen in the number and diversity of genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and characteristics of the leukaemic stem cells. The broad range of abnormalities across different AML subtypes suggests that improvements in clinical outcome will require the development of targeted therapies for each subtype of disease and the design of novel clinical trials to test these strategies. It is highly unlikely that further gains in long-term survival rates will be possible by mere intensification of conventional chemotherapy. In this review, we summarize recent studies that provide new insight into the genetics and biology of AML, discuss risk stratification and therapy for this disease, and profile some of the therapeutic agents currently under investigation.

It is conspicuously different from classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and is now recognized as distinctive form of B cell lymphoma. Although it has an indolent clinical course, it has a propensity for multiple and often late relapses. Although the majority of children present with early stage disease and without B symptoms, treatment strategy has, until recently, been identical to that used for cHL. This approach is excessively toxic as it predisposes these children and adolescents to serious late effects including end organ damage to heart, gonads, lungs, thyroid and second malignant neoplasms. The aim of this article is to review the published literature on the treatment outcomes of nLPHL in affected children and adolescents, and discuss the options for treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted anti-CD 20 antibody therapy.

For a number of years, biophysically detailed mathematical models of cardiac electrical activity have been used to explore how a compound, interfering with specific ion-channel function, may explain effects at the cell-, tissue- and organ-scales. With the advent of high-throughput screening of multiple ion channels in the wet-lab, and improvements in computational modelling of their effects on cardiac cell activity, more reliable prediction of pro-arrhythmic risk is becoming possible at the earliest stages of drug development. In this paper, we review the current use of biophysically detailed mathematical models of cardiac myocyte electrical activity in drug safety testing, and suggest future directions to employ the full potential of this approach.

However, research over the last decade has shown that GPCRs exist in multiple conformations, and that agonists can stabilize different active states. The distinct receptor conformations induced by ligands result in distinct receptoreffector complexes, which produce varying levels of activation or inhibition of subsequent signalling cascades. This concept, referred to as ligand-directed signalling or biased agonism has important biological and therapeutic implications. Opioid receptors are Gi/o GPCRs and regulate a number of important physiological functions, including pain, reward, mood, stress, gastrointestinal transport and respiration. A number of in vitro studies have shown biased agonism at the three opioid receptors (mu, d and kappa); however, in vivo consequences of this phenomenon have only recently been demonstrated. For the mu and delta opioid receptors, the majority of reported ligand selective behavioural effects are observed as differential adaptations to repeated drug administration. In terms of the kappa opioid receptor, clear links between ligand-selective signalling events and specific in vivo responses have been recently characterized. Drugs for all three receptors are either already used or are being developed for clinical applications. There is clearly a need to better characterize the specific events that occur following agonist stimulation and how these relate to in vivo responses. This understanding could eventually lead to the development of tailor-made pharmacotherapies where advantageous drug effects can be selectively targeted over adverse effects.

We aimed to assess the effect of pharmacological modulation of beta 3-adrenoceptors on portal pressure (PP) and systemic haemodynamics and their expression in the liver and mesenteric vessels of cirrhotic rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH PP, central venous pressure (CVP) and systemic haemodynamics were invasively assessed in control and CCl4-treated cirrhotic rats before and during infusion of the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, SR58611A. Tissue samples were also collected from liver, heart, portal vein and mesenteric artery for immunohistochemistry and molecular biology analysis. The effect of SR58611A on isolated portal vein was assessed. KEY RESULTS At baseline, cirrhotic rats showed portal hypertension, reduced CVP and hyperdynamic circulation. SR58611A induced a significant, dose-dependent decrease in PP in cirrhotic rats, but not in controls. Although both groups manifested a dose-dependent reduction in mean arterial pressure, this effect was associated with decreased cardiac index (CI) and unchanged indicized peripheral vascular resistance (PVRI) in cirrhotic rats and increased CI and decreased PVRI in control animals. Pretreatment with the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230 prevented all SR58611A-induced changes in cirrhotic rats. SR58611A concentration-dependently relaxed portal vein in cirrhotic rats to a significantly greater extent than in healthy rats; pretreatment with SR59230A completely prevented SR58611A-induced cirrhotic portal vein relaxation. Finally, beta 3-adrenoceptors were identified in the liver, heart and portal vein of cirrhotic and control animals; their expression was increased in cirrhotic rats. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS beta 3-Adrenoceptors are altered in portal hypertension of experimental cirrhosis and may represent a novel therapeutic target.

Now we need to understand just how incompletely penetrant genes make their contributions to psychopathology. Exciting new developments in molecular genetics and epigenetics provide new insight into gene action in principle but have been of limited value so far in understanding the emergence of psychopathology. Some of the most helpful postulates might come from evolutionary and developmental biology and agricultural breeding experiments. I describe the all but forgotten evolutionary mechanisms articulated by Schmalhausen, a Russian evolutionary biologist whose work was suppressed by Stalin in the 1940s. I focus on Schmalhausen's law, the observation that organisms living in conditions at the boundary of their tolerance in any one aspect of existence will be vulnerable to expression of genetic liabilities related to all other aspects of existence. I show how Schmalhausen's ideas are relevant to the results of a century-long corn-breeding experiment and the current concepts of facilitated variation and cryptic genetic variation. I then discuss the relevance of all of these to understanding genetic influences on personality and psychopathology.

Although the impact of prenatal maternal distress has been well documented, the potential mechanisms through which maternal psychosocial variables shape development have yet to be fully elucidated. Advances in molecular biology have highlighted the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene activity, neurobiology, and behavior and the potential role of environmentally induced epigenetic variation in linking early life exposures to long-term biobehavioral outcomes. In this article, we discuss evidence illustrating the association between maternal prenatal distress and both fetal and infant developmental trajectories and the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating these effects. Postnatal experiences may have a critical moderating influence on prenatal effects, and we review findings illustrating prenatal-postnatal interplay and the developmental and epigenetic consequences of postnatal mother-infant interactions. The in utero environment is regulated by placental function and there is emerging evidence that the placenta is highly susceptible to maternal distress and a target of epigenetic dysregulation. Integrating studies of prenatal exposures, placental function, and postnatal maternal care with the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology induced by maternal distress.

This in turn has opened new areas of investigation that can potentially bridge the gap between neuroscience and psychopathology. For the first time we can study the cell biology and genetics of neurons derived from any individual. Furthermore, by recapitulating in vitro the developmental steps whereby stem cells give rise to neuronal cells, we can now hope to understand factors that control typical and atypical development. We can begin to explore how human genes and their variants are transcribed into messenger RNAs within developing neurons and how these gene transcripts control the biology of developing cells. Thus, human-induced pluripotent stem cells have the potential to uncover not only what aspects of development are uniquely human but also variations in the series of events necessary for normal human brain development that predispose to psychopathology.

We tested the hypotheses that intensification of land use will reduce dung beetles richness, abundance and biomass and, consequently, their dung burial ability, affecting the interaction between dung beetles and flies and reducing its effectiveness as a natural biological control. In the Brazilian Amazon we sampled dung beetles, fly larvae and adults; and recorded the rate of dung removal by dung beetles across a gradient of land-use intensity from primary forest, secondary forest, agroforestry, agriculture to pasture. Our results provide evidence that land-use intensification results in a reduction of the richness, abundance and biomass of dung beetles, and this in turn results in lower rates of dung removal in the most simplified systems. We found no significant differences in the abundance of fly larvae between the different systems of land use. However, the number of adult flies differed significantly between land-use systems, presenting higher abundance in those sites with greater intensity of use (pasture and agriculture) and a lower abundance of adult flies in forested systems (primary and secondary forests, and agroforestry). Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of land-use systems, dung removal rates and dung beetle abundance, biomass and richness on adult dung-fly abundance. Our results also reveal that dung beetles are not solely responsible for fly control and that other factors linked to land use are influencing the populations of these detritus-feeding insects.

We have examined the expression of BPIFB1 (LPLUNC1), the prototypic two-domain containing family member, in lungs from CF patients and in mouse models of CF lung disease. BPIFB1 was localized in CF lung samples along with BPIFA1, MUC5AC, CD68 and NE and directly compared to histologically normal lung tissues and that of bacterial pneumonia. We generated novel antibodies to mouse BPIF proteins to conduct similar studies on ENaC transgenic (ENaC-Tg) mice, a model for CF-like lung disease. Small airways in CF demonstrated marked epithelial staining of BPIFB1 in goblet cells but staining was absent from alveolar regions. BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 were not co-localised in the diseased lungs. In ENaC-Tg mice there was strong staining of both proteins in the airways and luminal contents. This was most marked for BPIFB1 and was noted within 2 weeks of birth. The two proteins were present in distinct cells within epithelium. BPIFB1 was readily detected in BAL from ENaC-Tg mice but was absent from wild-type mice. Alterations in the expression of BPIF proteins is associated with CF lung disease in humans and mice. It is unclear if this elevation of protein production, which results from phenotypic alteration of the cells within the diseased epithelium, plays a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

However, placement of clear cell carcinomas into one of these 2 groups has been problematic as they exhibit morphologic, molecular, and clinical features that do not entirely resemble either Type I or Type II tumors. The present study aimed at better elucidating the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of clear cell carcinomas, in comparison with the 2 main broad categories. To this end, a panel of classic clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical parameters, including estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), ER beta, progesterone receptor, Ki67, p53, and HER2/neu was evaluated in 71 Type I, 157 Type II, and 21 clear cell carcinomas. Overall, findings from the present study support the idea that ovarian clear cell carcinomas are neither Type I nor Type II carcinomas of the ovary; indeed, results obtained showed that similarities between clear cell carcinomas and Type I were limited to the patient's age, tumor dimension, incidence of lymph node and extranodal metastases, and p53 labeling index, whereas the patient's age and incidence of extranodal metastases were the only parameters comparable with the Type II group. The hormonal receptor profile of clear cell carcinomas was characterized by low expression of nuclear ER alpha and progesterone receptor, and by almost exclusively nuclear ER beta immunopositivity, features significantly different from both Type I and II tumors. Finally, the percentage of HER2/neu-positive samples in clear cell carcinomas was 10- and 2.5-fold higher than Type I and Type II ovarian tumors, respectively. In conclusion, our study provides insights into clear cell carcinoma that could help in explaining its unique prognostic features, and, eventually, in orienting toward new therapeutic options.

During early events of infection, these viruses manipulate preexisting host cell signaling pathways to allow successful infection. The different proteins that compose viral particles are therefore likely to have critical functions not only in viral structures and in entry into target cell but also in evasion of the host's antiviral response. In this study, we analyzed the protein composition of bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4), a close relative of the human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Using mass spectrometry-based approaches, we identified 37 viral proteins associated with extracellular virions, among which 24 were resistant to proteinase K treatment of intact virions. Analysis of proteins associated with purified capsid-tegument preparations allowed us to define protein localization. In parallel, in order to identify some previously undefined open reading frames, we mapped peptides detected in whole virion lysates onto the six frames of the BoHV-4 genome to generate a proteogenomic map of BoHV-4 virions. Furthermore, we detected important glycosylation of three envelope proteins: gB, gH, and gp180. Finally, we identified 38 host proteins associated with BoHV-4 virions; 15 of these proteins were resistant to proteinase K treatment of intact virions. Many of these have important functions in different cellular pathways involved in virus infection. This study extends our knowledge of gammaherpesvirus virions composition and provides new insights for understanding the life cycle of these viruses.

During a surveillance study from 2005 to 2010, a novel alphacoronavirus, BatCoV HKU10, was detected in two very different bat species, Ro-BatCoV HKU10 in Leschenault's rousettes (Rousettus leschenaulti) (fruit bats in the suborder Megachiroptera) in Guangdong and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 in Pomona leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros pomona) (insectivorous bats in the suborder Microchiroptera) in Hong Kong. Although infected bats appeared to be healthy, Pomona leaf-nosed bats carrying Hi-BatCoV HKU10 had lower body weights than uninfected bats. To investigate possible interspecies transmission between the two bat species, the complete genomes of two Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and six Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains were sequenced. Genome and phylogenetic analyses showed that Ro-BatCoV HKU10 and Hi-BatCoV HKU10 represented a novel alphacoronavirus species, sharing highly similar genomes except in the genes encoding spike proteins, which had only 60.5% amino acid identities. Evolution of the spike protein was also rapid in Hi-BatCoV HKU10 strains from 2005 to 2006 but stabilized thereafter. Molecular-clock analysis dated the most recent common ancestor of all BatCoV HKU10 strains to 1959 (highest posterior density regions at 95% [HPDs], 1886 to 2002) and that of Hi-BatCoV HKU10 to 1986 (HPDs, 1956 to 2004). The data suggested recent interspecies transmission from Leschenault's rousettes to Pomona leaf-nosed bats in southern China. Notably, the rapid adaptive genetic change in BatCoV HKU10 spike protein by similar to 40% amino acid divergence after recent interspecies transmission was even greater than the similar to 20% amino acid divergence between spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) in bats and civets.

Thus, it is of utmost importance that species are delimited in an accurate and biologically meaningful way. However, due to morphologically similar, cryptic species, and processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, this is far from a trivial task. Here, we examine the accuracy and sensitivity to sampling strategy of three recently developed methods that aim to delimit species from multi-locus DNA sequence data without a priori assignments of samples to putative species. Specifically, we simulate data at two species tree depths and a variety of sampling strategies ranging from five alleles per species and five loci to 20 alleles per species and 100 loci to test (1) Structurama, (2) Gaussian clustering, and (3) nonparametric delimitation. We find that Structurama accurately delimits even relatively recently diverged (greater than 1.5 N generations) species when sampling 10 or more loci. We also find that Gaussian clustering delimits more deeply divergent species (greater than 2.5 N generations) relatively well, but is not sufficiently sensitive to delimit more recently diverged species. Finally, we find that nonparametric delimitation performs well with 25 or more loci if gene trees are known without error, but performs poorly with estimated gene genealogies, frequently over-splitting species and mis-assigning samples. We thus suggest that Structurama represents a powerful tool for use in species delimitation. It should be noted, however, that intraspecific population structure may be delimited using this or any of the methods tested herein. We argue that other methods, such as other species delimitation methods requiring a priori putative species assignments (e.g. SpeDeSTEM, Bayesian species delimitation), and other types of data (e.g. morphological, ecological, behavioral) be incorporated in conjunction with these methods in studies attempting to delimit species.

Therefore, invasion of and adaptation to novel habitats imply a gradual increase in population density, from that at or below what was found in the ancestral habitat to a density that may reach higher levels in the novel habitat following adaptation to that habitat. We tested this prediction of invasion biology by analyzing data on population density of breeding birds in their ancestral rural habitats and in matched nearby urban habitats that have been colonized recently across a continental latitudinal gradient. We estimated population density in the two types of habitats using extensive point census bird counts, and we obtained information on the year of urbanization when population density in urban habitats reached levels higher than that of the ancestral rural habitat from published records and estimates by experienced ornithologists. Both the difference in population density between urban and rural habitats and the year of urbanization were significantly repeatable when analyzing multiple populations of the same species across Europe. Population density was on average 30 % higher in urban than in rural habitats, although density reached as much as 100-fold higher in urban habitats in some species. Invasive urban bird species that colonized urban environments over a long period achieved the largest increases in population density compared to their ancestral rural habitats. This was independent of whether species were anciently or recently urbanized, providing a unique cross-validation of timing of urban invasions. These results suggest that successful invasion of urban habitats was associated with gradual adaptation to these habitats as shown by a significant increase in population density in urban habitats over time.

However, many cactus pollination systems are generalized as their flowers are pollinated by a wide spectrum of animals. For example, cactus species with white flowers, nocturnal anthesis and extended floral cycles would present generalized pollination systems in which both nocturnal and diurnal visitors could be effective pollinators. In this article, we tested this hypothesis by studying the pollination biology of Echinopsis schickendantzii, an Andean cactus with sphingophilous flowers. In addition, we evaluated whether the cactus's pollination system is complementary or redundant regarding the relative contributions of nocturnal and diurnal pollinators. Specifically, we studied the floral cycle, the reproductive system and the pollination effectiveness of floral visitors. The flowers of E. schickendantzii are self-incompatible; they opened at crepuscule and have an extended floral cycle. Moths were frequent visitors at night, whereas bees were frequent visitors during the day; both were effective pollinators of the cactus. Our results indicated that the flowers of this species present phenotypic, functional and ecological generalization, and their fruit set is determined by the contributions of both pollinator functional groups, i.e., they have complementary pollination systems. These results support the hypothesis that cacti in the extra-tropical deserts of South America have generalized pollination systems.

Trap-building predators represent case studies in such plasticity as the characteristics of their traps are dependent upon the substrate available. We investigated the effect of sand particle size on pit construction in antlions (Euroleon nostras), sand-dwelling insect larvae that build pitfall traps to capture prey. The pit construction behavior of the species comprises six stages. When antlions were exposed to different sand particle sizes, their behavior differed in terms of the occurrence and duration of particular stages and in the frequency of jerks produced during sand tossing. Jerk frequency was negatively correlated with sand particle size and also changed during pit construction. Furthermore, at larger particle sizes, individuals occasionally constructed irregular traps with a figure of eight shape, and they crossed the center of the truncated cone during deepening. In the largest substrate, particle size of antlions did not construct pits. Our results demonstrate that variation in traps under differing environmental conditions stems directly from behavioral plasticity in this species.

Results from the SEARCH Database","Abstract: Background: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP). It is unclear whether this is due to technical challenges related to operating on obese men or other biologic factors.

Objective: To examine whether obesity predicts higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (as a measure of residual PSA-producing tissue) after RP and if this accounts for the greater BCR risk in obese men.

Design, setting, and participants: A retrospective analysis of 1038 RP patients from 2001 to 2010 in the multicenter US Veterans Administration-based Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database with median follow-up of 41 mo.

Intervention: All patients underwent RP.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We evaluated the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and ultrasensitive PSA nadir within 6 mo after RP. Adjusted proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between BMI and BCR with and without PSA nadir.

Results and limitations: Mean BMI was 28.5 kg/m(2). Higher BMI was associated with higher PSA nadir on both univariable (p = 0.001) and multivariable analyses (p < 0.001). Increased BMI was associated with increased BCR risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; p = 0.007). Adjusting for PSA nadir slightly attenuated, but did not eliminate, this association (HR: 1.04, p = 0.043). When stratified by PSA nadir, obesity only significantly predicted BCR in men with an undetectable nadir (p = 0.006). Unfortunately, other clinically relevant end points such as metastasis or mortality were not available.

Conclusions: Obese men are more likely to have a higher PSA nadir, suggesting that either more advanced disease or technical issues confound an ideal operation.

The ability to predict therapeutic response, identify individuals at greatest risk for adverse clinical responses after therapeutic radiation doses, or identify individuals at high risk for carcinogenesis from environmental or medical radiation exposures has a medical and economic impact on both the individual and society at large. As radiotherapy incorporates particles, particularly particles larger than protons, into therapy, the need for such discriminators, (i.e., biomarkers) will become ever more important. Cellular assays for survival, DNA repair, or chromatid/chromosomal analysis have been used to identify at-risk individuals, but they are not clinically applicable. Newer approaches, such as genome-wide analysis of gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms and small copy number variations within chromosomes, are examples of technologies being applied to the discovery process. Gene expression analysis of primary or immortalized human cells suggests that there are distinct gene expression patterns associated with radiation exposure to both low and high linear energy transfer radiations and that those most radiosensitive are discernible by their basal gene expression patterns. However, because the genetic alterations that drive radio response may be subtle and cumulative, the need for large sample sizes of specific cell or tissue types is required. A systems biology approach will ultimately be necessary. Potential biomarkers from cell lines or animal models will require validation in a human setting where possible and before being considered as a credible biomarker some understanding of the molecular mechanism is necessary.

","Abstract: ""Medicine and Biology"" was one of five working groups of the ""Accelerators for America's Future"" Workshop held October 2009. The recently-released workshop report stresses that the leadership position of the United States in fields where accelerators play an important part is being seriously eroded because of lack of coordinated agency support for accelerator research and development. This is particularly true for biology and medicine. Radiation therapy with beams of protons and light ions was pioneered in the United States and has proven successful in the treatment of several different tumor sites in the body. Proton therapy is available in the United States in a number of centers; however, all but one contain accelerator and beam-delivery components manufactured abroad. Light-ion therapy is only available overseas. Why has the United States lost its lead in this field? The Working Group noted that in other countries, central governments are subsidizing construction and technology development by their industries, whereas in the United States funding for purchasing and building clinical facilities must be raised from private sources. As a result, most proton facilities in the United States, by virtue of having to recover investment costs, favor reimbursable treatments, detracting from the development of research protocols. The financial hurdle for starting a light-ion facility in the United States has been totally prohibitive for the private-equity market. While technological advances are being made that will provide some reduction in capital costs, the field will not flourish in the United States until effective funding means are developed that do not put the full burden on the private sector.

Tissue harvest was performed on the hind limbs of seven dogs. Stromal cells were isolated via serial expansion in culture. After four passages, tenogenesis was induced using either ascorbic acid alone or in conjunction with GDF-5. CD44, tenomodulin, collagen I, and collagen III expression levels were compared for each culture condition at 7 and 14 days following induction. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to evaluate cell morphology and production of tenomodulin and collagen I. SMSCs and BMSCs were successfully isolated in culture. Following tenocytic induction, SMSCs demonstrated an increased mean relative expression of tenomodulin, collagen I, and collagen III at 14 days. BMSCs only showed increased mean relative expression of collagen I, and collagen III at 14 days. IHC revealed positive staining for tenomodulin and collagen I at 14 days for both cell types. The morphology of skeletal muscle derived stromal cells at 14 days had an organized appearance in contrast to the haphazard arrangement of the bone marrow derived cells. GDF-5 did not affect gene expression, cell staining, or cell morphology significantly. Stromal cells from either bone marrow or skeletal muscle can be induced to increase expression of matrix genes; however, based on expression of tenomodulin and cell culture morphology SMSCs may be a more ideal candidate for tenocytic differentiation.

Although the E-cadherin has been shown to mediate a broad-ranging cellular signals and functions, its effects on matrix metabolism of intervertebral discs (IVDs) are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of E-cadherin on IVD matrix synthesis using pharmacological and molecular biology methods. We showed that high levels of the E-cadherin are expressed in rabbits IVD cells. Our study indicates that the ectopic expression of E-cadherin can stimulate matrix anabolism of the IVD cells, which was evidenced by increased expression of the matrix macromolecules aggrecan and collagen II. We found that E-cadherin induces the expression of BMP-4 and BMP-7 genes and enhances Smad1/5 phosphorylation. Blocking BMP activity uses noggin suppressed E-cadherin-mediated upregulation of aggrecan and collagen II. Moreover, inhibition of Smad1/5 phosphorylation by dorsomorphin significantly repressed the E-cadherin induced expression of aggrecan and collagen II at the both mRNA and protein levels. Together this study demonstrates that the E-cadherin stimulates the synthesis of IVD matrix macromolecules aggrecan and collagen II through the induction of BMP genes and enhancement of the Smad1/5 phosphorylation. Thus E-cadherin may have value in the treatment of degenerated discs. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Therefore, osteoarthritic (OA) samples (n?=?11) were compared with synovial membrane-like interface tissues from revision THR (n?=?10). VEGF-A and its receptors were stained using streptavidin-immunoperoxidase method. Their regulation by hypoxia and cytokines were studied in cultured fibroblasts using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). VEGFR1+ lining cells (p?<?0.01), stromal fibroblast-like cells (p?=?0.001) and stromal macrophage-like cells (p?<?0.05) were more numerous in rTHR than in OA. As to VEGFR2+, only stromal fibroblast-like cells in rTHR outnumbered those found in OA (p?<?0.05). VEGFRs in synovial fibroblasts were not affected by hypoxia, but VEGF increased 2.4-fold (p?<?0.05). Interleukin-4 up-regulated VEGFR1 expression 23-fold. This is the first study to describe a difference between rTHR and OA in VEGF receptors, particularly VEGFR1. Hypoxia increased VEGF, but the VEGFR1 increase in the lining and stroma is probably IL-4 driven, in accordance with the M2-type macrophage dominance in interface tissues. VEGF/VEGFR system is also affected by hypoxia and may play a role in angiogenesis and bone pathology in aseptic loosening of total hip implants. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The structure of VSV-G has been solved in two different conformations and fusion is known to be triggered by low pH. To investigate Class III fusion mechanisms, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the VSV-G prefusion structure in two different protonation states: at physiological pH (pH 7) and low pH present in the endosome (pH 5). Domain IV containing the fusion loops, which need to interact with the target membrane, exhibits the highest mobility. Energetic analyses revealed weakened interaction between Domain IV and the protein core at pH 5, which can be attributed to two pairs of structurally neighboring conserved and differentially protonated residues in the Domain IVcore interface. Energetic calculations also demonstrated that the interaction between the subunits in the core of the trimeric VSV-G is strengthened at pH 5, mainly due to newly formed interactions between the C-terminal loop of Domain II and the N-terminus of the adjacent subunit. A pair of interacting residues in this interface that is affected by differential protonation was shown to be the main effectors of this phenomenon. The results of this study thus enhance the mechanistic understanding of the effects of protonation changes in VSV-G. Proteins 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, in patients with poor acoustic windows, lower correlations were reported despite the use of contrast. We hypothesized that power modulation (PM) RT3DE imaging that uses low mechanical indices and provides uniform LV opacification could overcome this problem. Accordingly, we sought to: (i) Test the feasibility of quantification of LV volumes and EF from contrast-enhanced (CE) PM RT3DE images, (ii) validate this technique against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) reference and (iii) test its clinical value by quantifying the improvement in accuracy and reproducibility. We studied 20 patients who underwent CMR, harmonic nonenhanced RT3DE and CE PM RT3DE imaging on the same day. All images were analyzed to obtain end-systolic and end-diastolic LV volumes (EDV, ESV) and calculate EF. To determine the reproducibility of each RT3DE technique, imaging was repeated in the same setting by a second sonographer. In addition, patients were divided according to the quality of their RT3DE images into two groups, for which agreement with CMR and reproducibility were calculated separately. CE PM RT3DE imaging improved the accuracy of EDV, ESV and EF measurements in patients with poor acoustic windows without significantly affecting those in patients with optimal images. In addition, CE PM RT3DE imaging improved the reproducibility of the measurements, as reflected by a twofold decrease in intermeasurement variability. Importantly, the variability in CE PM RT3DE-derived volumes and EF was under 10%, irrespective of image quality. This methodology may become the new standard for LV size and function, which will be particularly important in patients with poor acoustic windows or contraindications to CMR.

In this article, an automatic whole breast lesion detection system based on the naive Bayes classifier using the PC-based US system Terason t3000 (Terason Ultrasound, Burlington, MA, USA) with a hand-held probe is proposed. To easily retrieve the US images for any regions of the breast, a clock-based storing system is proposed to record the scanned US images. A computer-aided detection (CAD) system is also developed to save the physicians' time for a huge volume of scanned US images. The pixel classification of the US is based on the naive Bayes classifier for the proposed lesion detection system. The pixels of the US are classified into two types: lesions or normal tissues. The connected component labeling is applied to find the suspected lesions in the image. Consequently, the labeled two-dimensional suspected regions are separated into two clusters and further checked by two-phase lesion selection criteria for the determination of the real lesion, while reducing the false-positive rate. The free-response operative characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed system. According to the experimental results of 31 cases with 33 lesions, the proposed system yields a 93.4% (31/33) sensitivity at 4.22 false positives (FPs) per hundred slices. Moreover, the speed for the proposed detection scheme achieves 12.3 frames per second (fps) with an Intel Dual-Core Quad 3 GHz processor and can be also effectively and efficiently used for other screening systems.

Four-hundred eighty-two patients with 483 invasive breast cancers who had no suspicious findings on preoperative axillary US were included in this study. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection. False-negative and true-negative results were compared in terms of age, body mass index (BMI), T-stage, pathologic N-stage and final diagnosis of breast cancer. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Of the 483 axillae with negative results on axillary US, 93 axillae of 93 patients showed false-negative results and the negative predictive value of axillary US was 80.8% (390/483). Seventy-five axillae (15.5%, 75/483) had N1 and 18 axillae (3.7%, 18/483) had N2 or N3 disease. Eighteen false-negative results with N2/N3 disease showed a significantly higher T stage (T2/T3) than those with N1 disease. As the T-stage increased, false-negative results were found more often on preoperative axillary US (p < 0.05). Age, BMI and final diagnosis of primary breast cancer were not associated with false-negative results on preoperative axillary US. Preoperative axillary US alone is insufficiently specific to obviate the need for SLNB because of the substantial number of false-negative results in patients with invasive breast cancer, although preoperative axillary US alone may exclude most cases of N2 and N3 disease.

Thirty-three lesions (18.4%) showed linear enhancement, a linear-shaped positive enhancement in the RFA-treated area. Seventeen of them were followed up with no treatment (remaining 16; dropout in eight, additional RFA in six and ineffective treatment in two) and three lesions (3/17, 17.6%) showed local tumor progression corresponding to linear enhancement at 7, 14, 19 months after RFA. Although there was no significant difference in local recurrence rate between the lesions with (3/17) and without linear enhancement (10/35), local tumor progression inside the ablation zone occurred only in the lesions with linear enhancement. In conclusion, linear enhancement inside the RFA-treated area should be followed up within 7 months because it has a risk of local tumor progression.

Representative of the latter, histotripsy uses HIFU at low duty factor to create energetic bubble clouds inside tissue to liquefy a region and has the advantages in real-time monitoring and lesion fidelity to treatment planning. We explored the impact of a preconditioning/ heating pulse on histotripsy lesion formation in porcine muscle samples. During sonication, a targeted square region 9 mm wide (lateral to the focal plane) was scanned in a raster pattern with a step size of 0.75 mm. The 20-s exposure at each treatment location consisted of a 5-s duration preconditioning burst at spatial-peak intensities from 0-1386 W/cm(2) followed by 5000 tone bursts at high intensity (with spatial-peak pulse-average intensity of 47.34 kW/cm(2), spatial-peak temporal-average intensity of 284 W/cm(2), peak compressional pressure of 102 MPa and peak rarefactional pressure of 17 MPa). The temperature increase for all exposures was measured using a thermal imager immediately after each exposure. Lesion volume increased with increasing amplitude of the preconditioning pulse until coagulation was observed, but lesion width/area did not change significantly with the amplitude. In addition, the lesion dimensions became smaller when the global tissue temperature was raised before applying the histotripsy pulsing sequence. Therefore, the benefit of the preconditioning pulse was not caused by global heating. (E-mail: bigelow@iastate.edu) (C) 2012 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

In this study, we demonstrated the potential therapeutic effect of microbubble-enhanced ultrasound (MEUS) combined with prothrombin to disrupt splenic circulation. A high-pressure-amplitude therapeutic ultrasound (TUS) device was used to treat 36 surgically exposed spleens in healthy New Zealand rabbits. Eighteen spleens were treated with either MEUS (n - 9) or MEUS combined with prothrombin (n - 9). The other 18 spleens were treated with TUS only or sham ultrasound exposure and served as the controls. The TUS was operated at a frequency of 831 kHz and a peak negative pressure of 4.8 MPa. Prothrombin was administered intravenously at 20 IU/kg. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and acoustic quantification were performed to assess splenic blood perfusion. We found significant blood perfusion slowdown and drop-off in the MEUS-treated spleens. The peak intensity dropped from 20.2 +/- 2.70 dB to 11.6 +/- 4.58 dB immediately after treatment. The spleens treated with the combination of MEUS and prothrombin showed consistently poor perfusion within 1 h. In histologic examination of the MEUS-treated spleens, we found significant dilatation of splenic sinuses, hemorrhage, interstitial edema and thrombosis. This study demonstrated that the vascular effects induced by microbubble-enhanced, high-pressure ultrasound can slow down or block blood perfusion in the rabbit spleen.

This study investigated the mechanism underlying the US-mediated release of luciferin-loaded MBs through the blood vessels to targeted cells using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) system. The luciferin-loaded MBs comprised an albumin shell with a diameter of 1234 +/- 394 nm (mean +/- SD) and contained 2.48 x 10(9) bubbles/mL; within each MB, the concentration of encapsulated luciferin was 1.48 x 10(-10) mg/bubble. The loading efficiency of luciferin in MBs was only about 19.8%, while maintaining both the bioluminescence and acoustic properties. In vitro and in vivo BLI experiments were performed to evaluate the US-mediated release of luciferin-loaded MBs. For in vitro results, the increase in light emission of luciferin-loaded albumin-shelled MBs after destruction via US sonication (6.24 +/- 0.72 x 10(7) photons/s) was significantly higher than that in the luciferin-loaded albumin-shelled MBs (3.11 +/- 0.33 x 10(7) photons/s) (p < 0.05). The efficiency of the US-mediated release of luciferin-loaded MBs in 4T1-luc2 tumor-bearing mice was also estimated.

The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results show a 60.42 +/- 7.63% increase of mAb expression in hybridoma cells. The evidence of structural changes of the cellular outer membrane in both transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images and the more than 20% lactate dehydrogenase release indicates that the increased mAb production is related to the increased cell permeability induced by LIPUS.

Here, we demonstrate ultrasound bioeffects in which the levels of genes in endothelial cells can be significantly altered by ultrasound-stimulated microbubble exposure. These were compared with established effects of radiation on endothelial cells at a gene level. Human-endothelial cells were exposed to ultrasound and microbubbles, radiation or combinations of ultrasound, microbubbles and radiation. Gene expression analyses revealed an up-regulation of genes known to be involved in apoptosis and ceramide-induced apoptotic pathways, including SMPD2, UGT8, COX6B1, Caspase 9 and MAP2K1 with ultrasound-stimulated microbubble exposure but not SMPD1. This was supported by immunohistochemistry and morphologic changes examined with cell microscopy, which showed changes in SMPD1 gene product in cells with microbubble exposure. This supports the hypothesis that ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles can induce significant bioeffect-related changes in gene expression and can affect ceramide signaling pathways in endothelial cells, leading to apoptosis.

ELIP are being developed for molecular imaging and image-guided therapeutic delivery. Stability of the echogenicity of ELIP in physiologic conditions is crucial to their successful translation to clinical use. In this study, we determined the effects of the surrounding media's dissolved air concentration, temperature transition and hydrodynamic pressure on the echogenicity of a chemically modified formulation of ELIP to promote stability and echogenicity. ELIP samples were diluted in porcine plasma or whole blood and pumped through a pulsatile flow system with adjustable hydrodynamic pressures and temperature. B-mode images were acquired using a clinical diagnostic scanner every 5 s for a total duration of 75 s. Echogenicity in porcine plasma was assessed as a function of total dissolved gas saturation. ELIP were added to plasma at room temperature (22 degrees C) or body temperature (37 degrees C) and pumped through a system maintained at 22 degrees C or 37 degrees C to study the effect of temperature transitions on ELIP echogenicity. Echogenicity at normotensive (120/80 mmHg) and hypertensive pressures (145/90 mmHg) was measured. ELIP were echogenic in plasma and whole blood at body temperature under normotensive to hypertensive pressures. Warming of samples from room temperature to body temperature did not alter echogenicity. However, in plasma cooled rapidly from body temperature to room temperature or in degassed plasma, ELIP lost echogenicity within 20 s at 120/80mmHg. The stability of echogenicity of a modified ELIP formulation was determined in vitro at body temperature, physiologic gas concentration and throughout the physiologic pressure range. However, proper care should be taken to ensure that ELIP are not cooled rapidly from body temperature to room temperature as they will lose their echogenic properties. Further in vivo investigations will be needed to evaluate the optimal usage of ELIP as blood pool contrast agents.

The early stage of experimentally induced secondary HAE in 45 rats was studied. Thirty-six HAE lesions in 33 rats, confirmed by pathologic examination, were examined by ultrasound (US), color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and then CEUS. Thirty-three lesions were found in 30 rats by US, and 30 lesions were detected in 27 rats by CEUS. The sensitivity of US and CEUS was 92% (95% CI 76%-98%) and 82% (95% CI 65%-93%), respectively. US imaging characteristics were categorized into four types: hyperechoic spot (type 1, 45.5%, 15/33), granular hyperechoic spots (type 2, 12.1%, 4/33), hyperechoic lesion (type 3, 30.3%, 10/33) and mixed pattern (type 4, 12.1%, 4/33). CDFI failed to detect blood flow signals in any lesions. CEUS results for 30 lesions showed ring enhancement in the peripheral area during the arterial phase and no filling effect in either the portal or the delayed phase (46.7%, 14/30); ring enhancement combined with central septa enhancement during the arterial phase and portal venous phase (46.7, 14/30), and no enhancement (6.6%, 2/30). The enhanced area, confirmed by pathologic examination, was an inflammatory reaction belt surrounding the lesion. The results of this study suggest that US, with high sensitivity, can be used as a screening method for early HAE lesions in the animal model, while CEUS can be used for displaying the peripheral blood perfusion and vesicle structure.

We have recently demonstrated a novel technique for the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are surface-coated with cationic lipid microbubbles (MBs) and displaced by acoustic radiation force (ARF) to a site of arterial injury. The objective of this study was to characterize ultrasound parameters for effective acoustic-based delivery of cell therapy. In vitro experiments were performed in a vascular flow phantom where MB-tagged MSCs were delivered toward the phantom wall using ARF generated with an intravascular ultrasound catheter. The translation motion velocity and adhesion of the MB-cell complexes were analyzed. Experimental data indicated that MSC radial velocity and adhesion to the vessel phantom increased with the time-averaged ultrasound intensity up to 1.65 W/cm(2), after which no further significant adhesion was observed. Temperature increase from baseline near the catheter was 5.5 +/- 0.8 degrees C with this setting. Using higher time-averaged ultrasound intensities may not significantly benefit the adhesion of MB-cell complexes to the target vessel wall (p = NS), but could cause undesirable biologic effects such as heating to the MB-cell complexes and surrounding tissue. For the highest time-averaged ultrasound intensity of 6.60 W/cm(2), the temperature increase was 11.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C.

Consequently, it was calibrated by the mean and diastolic pressure measured in the finger artery and compared with applanation tonometry, calibrated using the systolic and diastolic pressure in the brachial artery. The mean difference in estimating the mean blood pressure was 0.3 mm Hg (limits of agreement: -11.7 to 12.3 mm Hg). In estimating the systolic blood pressure, the mean difference was 8.0 mm Hg (limits of agreement: -29.8 to 45.8 mm Hg) and showed increasing variation with blood pressure. The systolic blood pressure values can be expected between 0.83 and 1.35 times the control method. In this study, we obtained proof-of-principle for noninvasively measuring blood pressure in the CCA using continuous finger blood pressure monitoring.

A new expression for the acoustic radiation force function, which is the radiation force per unit energy density and unit cross-sectional surface area for a sphere in a Gaussian beam, is presented in this paper. Numerical results for the radiation force function of a Gaussian beam incident upon the spherical particles are presented for rigid spheres, liquid spheres and elastic spheres immersed in water to illustrate the theory. The radiation force function vs. ka curve, ka being the radius times the wavenumber in the surrounding medium, is discussed for different beam widths. The acoustic radiation force function is determined by the parameters of the particles, with liquid spheres having smaller values than those for rigid and elastic spheres. The beam width also affects the acoustic radiation force function. When the radius of the sphere is larger than the beam width, the beam width has greater effects on the radiation force. This analysis helps analyzing and understanding the effects of the acoustic Gaussian beams on spherical objects.

In this experimental study, we evaluate the performance of the TR-MUSIC algorithm when the interrogated medium contains extended targets that cannot be considered as point scatterers, i.e., the size of the targets is on the order of the ultrasound wavelength or larger. We construct four tissue-mimicking phantoms, each of which contains glass spheres of a given size. We show that the quality of the phantom images obtained using the TR-MUSIC algorithm decreases with increasing sphere size. However, significant improvement is achieved when the image plane is divided into subregions, where each subregion is imaged separately. In this method, the TR-MUSIC calculations are performed on the windowed backscattered signals originating from each subregion. Our study demonstrates that the TR-MUSIC algorithm with time windowing can accurately locate extended targets but cannot provide the shape and reflectivity of the targets.

Although total shear strain elastography was initially proposed for this purpose, it did not evolve beyond the initial reported finite element model (FEM) and simulation studies. One of the major reasons for this was the practical limitation in estimating the tissue motion perpendicular (lateral) to the ultrasound (US) beam as accurately as the motion along the US beam (axial). Nevertheless, there has been a sustained effort in developing methods to improve the lateral motion tracking accuracy and thereby obtain better quality total shear strain elastogram (TSSE). We hypothesize that in some cases, even if good quality TSSE becomes possible, it may still be advantageous to utilize only the axial-shear strain (one of the components of the total shear strain) elastogram (ASSE). Specifically, we show through FEM and corroborating tissue-mimicking gelatin phantom experiments that the unique ""fill-in"" discriminant feature that was introduced recently for asymmetric breast lesion classification is depicted only in the ASSE and not in the TSSE. Note that the presence or conspicuous absence of this feature in ASSE was shown to characterize asymmetric inclusions' boundaries as either loosely-bonded or firmly-bonded to the surrounding, respectively. This might be an important observation because the literature suggests that benign breast lesions tend to be loosely-bonded, while malignant tumors are usually firmly-bonded. The results from the current study demonstrate that the use of shear strain lesion ""fill-in"" as a discriminant feature in the differentiation between asymmetric malignant and benign breast lesions is only possible when using the ASSEs and not the TSSEs.

This study examined anatomical and histological characteristics of genital organs of 60 Poeppig's woolly monkey females in the wild in different reproductive stages, collected by rural hunters in the northeastern Peruvian Amazon. The endometrium, the endometrial glands, and the myometrium showed a significant increase in size related to the follicular growth. In nonpregnant females in the follicular phase, the endometrium, the endometrial glands, and the myometrium showed a significant increase related to the follicular growth. Nonpregnant females in the luteal phase had a thicker endometrium, a greater proliferation of endometrial glands, and a thicker myometrium, compared to females in the follicular phase. Nonpregnant females with small antral follicles presented high amounts of collagen beneath the endometrial epithelium, a sign of endometrial regeneration after menstruation that could be useful for the diagnosis of the reproductive phase in this species. A larger proportion of secreting cervical glands was observed in pregnant females compared to other females. The cervical mucous secretion occupied the lumen of the endocervical canal, assuring that no material could enter the uterus during gestation. The Poeppig's woolly monkey showed different vaginal epithelium features in accordance with the reproductive state of the female, suggesting that vaginal cytology could be a successful methodology with which to characterize the estrous cycle of wild primates. The present reproductive evaluation of Poeppig's woolly monkey provides important information that could improve the methodologies for the diagnosis of the reproductive phase of females, the assisted reproductive techniques in non-human primates, and could also give us opportunity for comparative studies and an insight into the evolution of animal reproductive biology, including humans.

Differentiation of these multinucleated giant cells from precursors is controlled by the cytokine RANKL, which through its receptor RANK initiates a signaling cascade culminating in the activation of transcriptional regulators which induce the expression of the bone degradation machinery. The transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) is the master regulator of this process and in its absence osteoclast differentiation is aborted both in vitro and in vivo. Differential mRNA expression analysis by microarray is used to identify genes of potential physiologic relevance across nearly all biologic systems. We compared the gene expression profile of murine wild-type and NFATc1-deficient osteoclast precursors stimulated with RANKL and identified that the majority of the known genes important for osteoclastic bone resorption require NFATc1 for induction. Here, five novel RANKL-induced, NFATc1-dependent transcripts in the osteoclast are described: Nhedc2, Rhoc, Serpind1, Adcy3 and Rab38. Despite reasonable hypotheses for the importance of these molecules in the bone resorption pathway and their dramatic induction during differentiation, the analysis of mice with mutations in these genes failed to reveal a function in osteoclast biology. Compared to littermate controls, none of these mutants demonstrated a skeletal phenotype in vivo or alterations in osteoclast differentiation or function in vitro. These data highlight the need for rigorous validation studies to complement expression profiling results before functional importance can be assigned to highly regulated genes in any biologic process.

We used a multidisciplinary approach to determine which of these three scenarios underlies the invasion of the tropical ant Wasmannia auropunctata in a Mediterranean region (i.e. Israel). Species distribution models (SDM), phylogeographical analyses at a broad geographical scale and laboratory experiments on appropriate native and invasive populations indicated that Israeli populations followed an invasion scenario in which adaptation to cold occurred at the southern limit of the native range before dispersal to Israel.

Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 degrees C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.

Recently empirical attention has shifted to the relationships between broader ecological influences (e.g., education, ethnicity and income) and ECC; however, how such determinants interplay in the aetiology of ECC remains unclear. An intermediary mechanism that warrants greater empirical attention is parental influences. This oversight is interesting given the primacy of the parent in governing the child's proximate environment and the likelihood of the child endorsing adaptive or maladaptive health attitudes, beliefs and behaviours. The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of the evidence for parental influences on the development of caries in children aged 0-6 years.

Data: All studies testing associations between dental caries and socio-demographic factors, feeding practices, parent attributes, behaviours, oral health, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs in children aged 0-6 years, published between 2006 and 2011.

Study selection: Fifty-five studies were included from an initial identification of 1805 studies.

Conclusions: To date, most research has focused on the association between caries and socio-demographic and feeding factors with few studies exploring parents' attributes, attitudes, knowledge and beliefs, and none exploring possible pathways between the multiple layers of influences potentially accounting for how determinants of ECC operate and traverse individual, familial, community, and socio-cultural contexts.

PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) and c-Kit (stem cell factor receptor) signaling play important roles in initiation and maintenance of malignant glioma. This study demonstrated that long-term culture with imatinib mesylate, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor against PDGFR and c-Kit resulted in reduced cancer stem cell ability in glioblastoma cells through cell differentiation. Derived from RG glioblastoma cells co-cultured with imatinib for 3 months, RG-IM cells showed distinct properties of cell cycle distribution and morphology in addition to significantly decreased ability to form aggregates and colonies in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Increased expression of GFAP (astrocyte marker) and class III beta-tubulin isotype (Tuj1, neuron marker) were detected with morphology like neurons or astrocytes in RG-IM cells. Furthermore, decreased expression of stem cell markers, i.e., CD133, Oct-3/4, nestin, and Bmi1, and increased terminal neural cell markers, GFAP, Tuj1, etc., were identified in RG-IM at the mRNA level. All these markers were changed in RG cells when PDGFRB and c-Kit expression were double knocked down by siRNA. Cell differentiation agent, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) caused similar effect as that with imatinib in RG cells, while adding PDGF-B and SCF in RG-IM resulted in cell dedifferentiation to some extent. Moreover, differentiation in RG cells treated by imatinib or ATRA was mainly driven by MAPK signaling pathways.

Special attention is given to the emergence of new diseases or the re-emergence of old ones on several crops, and on the results and problems encountered by using grafting, biofumigation and other non-chemical control methods. The search for effective, economically and environmentally sound methods for soil and substrate disinfestation remains a continuous and challenging task for growers, despite intensive research. The European Regulation No 1107/2009, concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and the European Directive No 2009/128/EC, establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides, requires, by 2014, that all professional users implement the general principles of IPM.

Herein we explore the impact of the density of T and B lymphocytes in prostate cancer tissue on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy in 3261 prostate cancer tissue samples. The number of prostate cancer-infiltrating CD3-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells per tissue spot in a tissue microarray format was determined by immunohistochemistry and was correlated with clinical and pathological data from the same patient cohort. Patients with very low and very high numbers of CD3-positive T cells per tissue spot had a significantly shorter PSA recurrence-free survival compared to patients with intermediate numbers of T cells (p=0.0188). Furthermore, a high number of CD3-positive T cells per tissue spot was associated with fusion type prostate cancer identified by ERG expression analysis. The number of CD20-positive B cells per tissue spot was not associated with other clinical and histopathological parameters. This study indicates that the density of T but not B cells plays a functional role in the biology of prostate cancer and may have an impact on clinical outcome in this frequent neoplasia.

An important surface parameter is the surface roughness on both the micrometer and nanometer scales in the lateral direction. Two approaches have been combined to create two-dimensional roughness gradients by adding a nanoparticle density gradient onto a gradient of micro-featured roughness. All fabricated gradients were extensively characterized by SEM, AFM and optical profilometry to ensure their quality and to determine the roughness parameter Re along the gradient. Additionally, a Fourier-transform approach was applied that allows a wavelength-dependent analysis of the surface topography. Since cell-culture assays require replicate experiments, a replica technique was used to create copies of the master gradient. Creating a negative replica in an elastomeric material served as a mold for a subsequent ceramic-casting process. A positive replica was then formed from epoxy resin, which was subsequently coated with titanium and used for cell studies. Finally, these gradients were used in cell-culture assays to determine cellular response to surface roughness. The results clearly demonstrate the influence of surface roughness on the production by osteoblasts of markers for osteogenesis. It was shown that high roughness in the micrometer range, combined with an intermediate nanofeature density (30-40 features/mu m(2)), leads to the highest degree of osteopontin production after 14 days.

To fully accomplish this potential, the successful application of separation processes for the isolation and purification of stem cells and stem cell-derived cells is a crucial issue. Although separation methods have been used over the past decades for the isolation and enrichment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells for transplantation in hemato-oncological settings, recent achievements in the stem cell field have created new challenges including the need for novel scalable separation processes with a higher resolution and more cost-effective. Important examples are the need for high-resolution methods for the separation of heterogeneous populations of multipotent adult stem cells to study their differential biological features and clinical utility, as well as for the depletion of tumorigenic cells after pluripotent stem cell differentiation. Focusing on these challenges, this review presents a critical assessment of separation processes that have been used in the stem cell field, as well as their current and potential applications. The techniques are grouped according to the fundamental principles that govern cell separation, which are defined by the main physical, biophysical, and affinity properties of cells. A special emphasis is given to novel and promising approaches such as affinity-based methods that take advantage of the use of new ligands (e.g., aptamers, lectins), as well as to novel biophysical-based methods requiring no cell labeling and integrated with microscale technologies.

Here, we apply a synthetic hybrid promoter approach for the creation of strong promoter libraries in the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic hybrid promoters are composed of two modular componentsthe enhancer element, consisting of tandem repeats or combinations of upstream activation sequences (UAS), and the core promoter element. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with three main case studies. First, we establish a dynamic range of constitutive promoters and in doing so expand transcriptional capacity of the strongest constitutive yeast promoter, PGPD, by 2.5-fold in terms of mRNA levels. Second, we demonstrate the capacity to impart synthetic regulation through a hybrid promoter approach by adding galactose activation and removing glucose repression. Third, we establish a collection of galactose-inducible hybrid promoters that span a nearly 50-fold dynamic range of galactose-induced expression levels and increase the transcriptional capacity of the Gal1 promoter by 15%. These results demonstrate that promoters in S. cerevisiae, and potentially all yeast, are enhancer limited and a synthetic hybrid promoter approach can expand, enhance, and control promoter activity.

Here, we show that a modified DNA Assembler approach can be used to rapidly assemble multiple-gene biosynthetic pathways in yeast and then integrate these assembled pathways at a site-specific location in the chloroplast genome of the microalgal species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a proof of concept, this method was used to successfully integrate and functionally express up to three reporter proteins (AphA6, AadA, and GFP) in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. An analysis of the relative gene expression of the engineered strains showed significant differences in the mRNA expression levels of the reporter genes and thus highlights the importance of proper promoter/untranslated region selection when constructing a target pathway. This new method represents a useful genetic tool in the construction and integration of complex biochemical pathways into the chloroplast genome of microalgae and should aid current efforts to engineer algae for biofuels production and other desirable natural products.

Patients & methods: Two of the authors independently performed a literature search with no date or language restrictions. Eligible studies were control-matched, population-based and hospital-based studies that addressed the outcome of patients diagnosed during pregnancy or 1-year afterwards. The primary and secondary end-points were overall and disease-free survival respectively. Pooling of data was done using the random effect model.

Results: 30 studies were included in this meta-analysis (3,628 cases and 37,100 controls). PABC patients had a significantly higher risk of death compared to those with non-pregnancy-related breast cancer (pooled hazard ratio (pHR): 1.44; 95% CI [1.27-1.63]). The same results were encountered on restricting the analysis to HRs of multivariate analyses (pHR: 1.40 [1.17-1.67]). A clearer trend of poorer outcome was seen in those diagnosed postpartum (pHR: 1.84; 95% CI [1.28-2.65]) than those diagnosed during pregnancy (pHR: 1.29; 95% CI [0.74-2.24]). DFS analysis showed a significantly higher risk of relapse associated with PABC as well (pHR: 1.60 [1.19-2.16]).

Conclusion: Our results show that PABC is independently associated with poor survival particularly those diagnosed shortly post-partum. This underscores a possible impact of the pregnant breast microenvironment on the biology and consequently the prognosis of these tumors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular crosstalk between expression mechanisms has been identified in a range of cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme. However, hardly any literature exists that addresses whether cancer stem cells utilize these same interconnected pathways. Protein factors commonly implicated in malignant tumors include extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), N-cadherin, and integrin alpha 6. Although studies have reported the molecular crosstalk involved among these proteins, the present study illustrates the importance of the ERK transduction pathway in N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 regulated invasion in GSCs. Conversely, the data also suggests that GSCs rely on N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 interaction to regulate ERK signaling. Moreover, confocal visualization revealed the co-localization of N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 in GSCs and clinical surgical biopsies extracted from glioma patients. Interestingly. ERK knockdown reduced this co-localization. Upon co-culturing GSCs with human umbilical cord blood stem cells (hUCBSCs), we observed a subsequent decrease in pERK, N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 expression. In addition, co-culturing hUCBSCs with GSCs decreased co-localization of N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 in GSCs. Our results demonstrate the dynamic interplay among ERK, N-cadherin and integrin alpha 6 in GSC invasion and also reveal the therapeutic potential of hUCBSCs in treating the molecular crosstalk observed in GSC-regulated invasion.

Average infection prevalence was 0.15 across all surveyed populations (range 0-0.29) and only the site with the smallest sample size (n = 5) was negative. Three genotypes differing by 2.6-4.1 % in a 271 bp region of 16S rRNA gene were identified. Two variants co-occurred in sites in North Carolina and New York, but were not observed in the same tick at those sites. The third genotype was found only in Georgia. Phylogenetic analysis of this fragment indicated that the three variants are more closely related to ""Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii"" genotypes from other tick species than to each other. This variation suggests that multiple independent introductions occurred in A. americanum which may provide insight into bacterial spread within its ecosystem and parasitism on this tick. Whether the presence of this bacterium affects acquisition or maintenance of other pathogens and symbionts in A. americanum or the survival, biology and evolution of the tick itself is unknown.

The underwater video system VideoSolo, designed for use in remote places, combines advantages in comparison to older systems necessitating the presence of a ship and whose autonomy is generally limited in time due to biofouling. All these issues have been resolved in VideoSolo, a fully autonomous long-term system, programmable, easy to set up and deploy (the housing weighs only 3 kg). It has sufficient energy storage and an anti-biofouling system in the form of its hydro-wiper, enabling continuous operation for up to one month. The experiment was conducted in a remote place (Glorioso Island, SW Indian Ocean) where the system was installed in front of the same coral colony (1 m(2)) at a depth of 8 m. Data was recorded in May for two subsequent years and six times per day (between 6 am and 4 pm). The analysis of the video sequences enabled the recording of 6224 individuals of 75 species belonging to 16 families over 41 days of experiment. At a small spatial scale, fish assemblages were variable over time at the three temporal scales studied. The number of individuals and species observed was variable between years whilst the number of individuals observed per day remained relatively stable through time. When occurrences were considered, less variation was observed between years. Analyses of temporal fish variability on the most abundant families revealed that the abundances of Acanthuridae, Labridae, Scaridae and resident Pomacentridae were significantly different between years and inversely so for the non-resident Pomacentridae. When the diurnal variations of fish assemblages were considered, the abundances differed significantly over time for Acanthuridae, higher in the morning (6 am and 9 am), and for Scaridae, higher at sunrise (6 am) and sunset (4 pm). The abundances of Pomacentridae and Labridae were stable from sunrise to sunset. The variability between years could be linked to events such as recruitment whilst daily variations could be more related to the effects of tidal cycles whose effects may have created periodic feeding opportunities. VideoSolo has demonstrated its efficiency and has remarkable potential in the field of aquatic biology in any location, as no human presence is required for it to work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

NRBP1 interacts directly with TSC-22, a potential tumor suppressor gene that is differently expressed in prostate cancer. Consequently, we analyzed the role of NRBP1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and its expression on prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMA). METHODS The effect of NRBP1 expression on tumor cell growth was analyzed by using RNAi. NRBP1 protein expression was evaluated on two TMAs containing prostate samples from more than 1,000 patients. Associations with clinico-pathological features, the proliferation marker Ki67 and survival data were analyzed. RESULTS RNAi mediated silencing of NRBP1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in reduced cell growth (P?<?0.05). TMA analysis revealed NRBP1 protein expression in benign prostate hyperplasia in 6% as compared to 60% in both, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer samples. Strong NRBP1 protein expression was restricted to prostate cancer and correlated with higher expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (P?<?0.05). Further, patients with strong NRBP1 protein expression showed poor clinical outcomes (P?<?0.05). Analysis of matched localized cancer tissues before and after castration revealed that post-therapy-related repression of NRBP1 expression was significantly associated with better overall survival. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that expression of NRBP1 is up-regulated during the progression of prostate cancer and that high NRBP1 expression is linked with poor prognosis and enhanced tumor cell growth.

Suppose we interpret the entropy of a random object as a measurement of the uncertainty about its outcome. This measurement is expected to decrease when the object's outcome is confined into a shrinking interval. Entropies conforming to this intuition are thus sensible and likely useful measures of uncertainty. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Shannon entropy of an absolutely continuous random variable to be an increasing function of the interval. Similar results are also obtained for the Renyi entropy of absolutely. continuous random variables and their convolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The wall of a carbon nanotube undergoes a collapse and a corresponding propagation of the collapse when a torsion loading applied to the tube is beyond a critical value. The van der Waals force between the encapsulated DNA molecule and the collapsed wall of the nanotube on one hand is a driving force to push the molecule out of the tube, while may also prevent the ejection when the onset of the collapsed wall is in front of the molecule. To ensure a complete DNA ejection, a design of a stopper, a small fixed portion on the carbon nanotube to prevent the collapsed wall from propagating in front of the DNA molecule, is developed. The effects of the environmental temperature, the torsion loading, and the size of the nanotube on the delivering process of the DNA molecule are also examined. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of ejection of DNA molecules from carbon nanotubes subjected to torsion and provide guidance on designs of the DNA delivery in biology and medical applications.

Upon addition of Zn2+ to solutions of CTMPA, an observable blue to light red color change occurs that can be monitored by using UV-vis spectroscopy. Concomitantly, a remarkably hypsochromic shift (ca.140 nm) in the emission maximum of CTMPA takes place from 730 nm to 590 nm. The observations indicate that association of the probe with Zn2+ leads to shortening of the conjugated, pi-electron system in the cyanine dye, the phenomenon likely responsible for the large hypsochromic shift observed in emission spectra. Since CTMPA has meritorious features, including a large spectral shift induced by Zn2+, a low fluorescence background and a high sensitivity toward Zn2+, CTMPA was employed to monitor endogeneous zinc ions released during apoptosis and trace intact Zn2+ during zebrafish development. Owing to its low background and high sensitivity, CTMPA serves as the first probe for fluorescence detection of neuromasts in zebrafish. The results obtained from experiments using live cells and organisms suggest that CTMPA will be a highly useful probe in zinc biology studies. The effort has demonstrated that a strategy, which relies on changes in the pi-electron conjugation length of cyanine molecules promoted by guest coordination, has great potential for the creation of cyanine-based probes.

The generation of bio-artificial muscles from satellite cells has been ongoing for about 15 years, but has never been used for generation of meat, while it already is a great source of animal protein.

In order to serve as a credible alternative to livestock meat, lab or factory grown meat should be efficiently produced and should mimic meat in all of its physical sensations, such as visual appearance, smell, texture and of course, taste. This is a formidable challenge even though all the technologies to create skeletal muscle and fat tissue have been developed and tested. The efficient culture of meat will primarily depend on culture conditions such as the source of medium and its composition. Protein synthesis by cultured skeletal muscle cells should further be maximized by finding the optimal combination of biochemical and physical conditions for the cells. Many of these variables are known, but their interactions are numerous and need to be mapped. This involves a systematic, if not systems, approach. Given the urgency of the problems that the meat industry is facing, this endeavor is worth undertaking. As an additional benefit, culturing meat may provide opportunities for production of novel and healthier products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, several models for lymphatic vascular research and markers specific for lymphatic endothelium have been characterized. Despite these significant achievements, our understanding of the early lymphatic development is still rather limited. The purpose of the study was to further define early lymphatic differentiation regulatory pathways. In the present study, we have developed conditions leading to lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation under both serum-rich and serum-free conditions, using the coculture system of Flk-1-positive vascular precursors derived from murine embryonic stem (ES) cells grown on an OP9 stromal cell layer. In this work, we also identified Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) as a negative regulator of lymphvasculogenesis from ES-derived vascular progenitors. Finally, we could show that TGF beta 1 addition decreases COUP-TFII and Sox18 mRNA levels, which are two transcription factors known to be involved in early lymphatic endothelial differentiation. Taken together these findings support the concept that manipulating the TGF beta signaling pathway may represent an interesting target to favor lymphatic endothelial cell expansion for cell replacement strategies.

To more definitively study the role of endogenously produced PAI-1 in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) PANC-1 cell line biology, we used anti-PAI-1 shRNA to create stable PAI-1 deficient cells (PD-PANC-1s). PD-PANC-1s exhibited a heterogeneous morphology. While the majority of cells exhibited a cuboidal shape similar to the parental PANC-1 or the vector-infected control cells, numerous large cells with long filopodia and a neuronal-like appearance were observed. Although both Vector-control cells and PD-PANC-1s expressed mRNAs that are characteristic of mesenchymal, neural, and epithelial phenotypes, epithelial marker RNAs were up-regulated (e.g., E-cadherin, 32-fold) whereas mesenchymal marker RNAs were down-regulated (e.g., Thy1, ninefold) in PD-PANC-1s, suggesting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Neural markers exhibited both up- and down-regulation. Immunocytochemistry indicated that epithelial-like PD-PANC-1s expressed E-cadherin and beta-catenin in significantly more cells, while neural-like cells exhibited robust expression of organized beta-3-tubulin. PAI-1 and E-cadherin were rarely co-expressed in the same cells. Indeed, examination of PAI-1 and E-cadherin mRNAs expression in additional cell lines yielded clear inverse correlation. Indeed, infection of Colo357 PAC cells (that exhibit high expression of E-cadherin) with PAI-1-expressing adenovirus led to a marked decrease in E-cadherin expression and to enhanced migration of cells from clusters. Our results suggest that endogenous PAI-1 suppresses expression of E-cadherin and differentiation in PAC cells in vitro, supporting its negative impact on tumor prognosis. J. Cell.

Indeed, it is currently well documented how a class of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, are conserved among the species, expressed in different tissues and cell types and involved in almost every biological process, including cell cycle, growth, apoptosis, differentiation and stress response, exerting a finely tuned regulation of gene expression by targeting multiple molecules.

As a consequence of the widespread range of processes they are able to influence, it is not surprising that miRNA deregulation is a hallmark of several pathological conditions, including cancer. Indeed, the aberrant expression of these tiny molecules in human tumors is not just a casual association, but they can exert a causal role, as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, in different steps of the tumorigenic process, from initiation and development to progression toward the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype.

An increasing body of evidence has indeed proved the importance of miRNAs in cancer, suggesting their possible use as diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers and leading to exploit miRNA-based anticancer therapies, either alone or in combination with current targeted therapies, with the goal to improve disease response and increase cure rates. Here, we review our current knowledge about miRNA involvement in cancer.

Today they are best known for their exceptionally successful application in flat panel displays, but they actually exhibit a plethora of unique and attractive properties that offer tremendous potential for fundamental science as well as innovative applications well beyond the realm of displays. Today this full breadth of the liquid crystalline state of matter is becoming increasingly recognized and numerous new and exciting lines of research are being opened up. We review this exciting development, focusing primarily on the physics aspects of the new research thrusts, in which liquid crystals - thermotropic as well as lyotropic - often meet other types of soft matter, such as polymers and colloidal nano- or microparticle dispersions. Because the field is of large interest also for researchers without a liquid crystal background we begin with a concise introduction to the liquid crystalline state of matter and the key concepts of the research field. We then discuss a selection of promising new directions, starting with liquid crystals for organic electronics, followed by nanotemplating and nanoparticle organization using liquid crystals, liquid crystal colloids (where the liquid crystal can constitute either the continuous phase or the disperse phase, as droplets or shells) and their potential in e.g. photonics and metamaterials, liquid crystal-functionalized polymer fibers, liquid crystal elastomer actuators, ending with a brief overview of activities focusing on liquid crystals in biology, food science and pharmacology.

It can be particularly severe in transplant recipients that have a current or a previous coccidioidal infection. Fatal case of coccidioidomycosis has been described in this group of patients.

Aims: We report a severe case of pneumonia caused by C. posadassi in a 29 year-old white woman that had been admitted to hospital as part of the evaluation for bilateral lung transplantation. The patient was a native and resident of Catamarca, Argentina. Molecular methodologies contributed to the species identification.

Methods: Clinical, laboratory records and microbiological tests were carried out to diagnose the infection and to identify C. posadasii.

Results: A fungus was isolated from BAL culture. Phenotypic characterization, specific PCR and experimental animal inoculation demonstrated the presence of C. posadasii. The patent responded well to amphotericin B deoxycholate. Lung transplantation was postponed.

Conclusions: Specific PCR can be an important alternative for the correct identification of C. immitis or C. posadasii in laboratories with implemented molecular biology tools.

Results are often visualized as a two-dimensional scatter or contour plot. Because these plots can be relatively diffuse, it is not always straightforward to discern a relationship between measured parameters. We have demonstrated that quantitative trends can be fit to the single-cell data generated from a heterogeneous population. We engineered Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells to express a broad range of oncogenic Ras levels. Instead of individual cultures with individual expression levels, a continuous range of levels was expressed by different cells in one heterogeneous culture. We then stained cells for downstream Erk phosphorylation to monitor MAPK signaling or employed an E2F-responsive genetic reporter to monitor cell-cycle activity. Subsequent analysis by flow cytometry and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) revealed that increasing Ras oncogene expression led to increasing MAPK signaling. In contrast, E2F activity peaked at an optimal, intermediate level of Ras. To make this analytical method widely available to others, we have provided a software application that performs LOWESS on any two-parameter population data collected by flow cytometry.

Previous analyses of their transcriptional regulatory networks have shown that they exhibit high plasticity during evolution and suggested that both converge to scale-free-like structures. Nevertheless, beyond this suggestion, no analyses have been carried out to identify the common systems-level components and principles governing these organisms. Here we show that these two phylogenetically distant organisms follow a set of common novel biologically consistent systems principles revealed by the mathematically and biologically founded natural decomposition approach. The discovered common functional architecture is a diamond-shaped, matryoshka-like, three-layer (coordination, processing, and integration) hierarchy exhibiting feedback, which is shaped by four systems-level components: global transcription factors (global TFs), locally autonomous modules, basal machinery and intermodular genes. The first mathematical criterion to identify global TFs, the kappa-value, was reassessed on B. subtilis and confirmed its high predictive power by identifying all the previously reported, plus three potential, master regulators and eight sigma factors. The functionally conserved cores of modules, basal cell machinery, and a set of non-orthologous common physiological global responses were identified via both orthologous genes and non-orthologous conserved functions. This study reveals novel common systems principles maintained between two phylogenetically distant organisms and provides a comparison of their lifestyle adaptations.

Languages variously employ tones, clicks, or manual signs to signal differences in meaning; some languages lack the noun-verb distinction (e.g., Straits Salish), whereas others have a proliferation of fine-grained syntactic categories (e.g., Tzeltal); and some languages do without morphology (e.g., Mandarin), while others pack a whole sentence into a single word (e.g., Cayuga). A challenge for evolutionary biology is to reconcile the diversity of languages with the high degree of biological uniformity of their speakers. Here, we model processes of language change and geographical dispersion and find a consistent pressure for flexible learning, irrespective of the language being spoken. This pressure arises because flexible learners can best cope with the observed high rates of linguistic change associated with divergent cultural evolution following human migration. Thus, rather than genetic adaptations for specific aspects of language, such as recursion, the coevolution of genes and fast-changing linguistic structure provides the biological basis for linguistic diversity. Only biological adaptations for flexible learning combined with cultural evolution can explain how each child has the potential to learn any human language.

In this study, we developed a delayed mathematical model to describe the virus-induced interferon (IFN) signaling process by considering several key players in the innate immune response. Using dynamic analysis and numerical simulation, we evaluated the following predictions regarding the antiviral responses: (1) When the replication ratio of virus is less than 1, the infectious virus will be eliminated by the immune system's defenses regardless of how the time delays are changed. (2) The IFN positive feedback regulation enhances the stability of the innate immune response and causes the immune system to present the bistability phenomenon. (3) The appropriate duration of viral replication and IFN feedback processes stabilizes the innate immune response. The predictions from the model were confirmed by monitoring the virus titer and IFN expression in infected cells. The results suggest that the balance between viral replication and IFN-induced feedback regulation coordinates the dynamical behavior of virus-triggered signaling and antiviral responses. This work will help clarify the mechanisms of the virus-induced innate immune response at a system level and provide instruction for further biological experiments.

Thermal and Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) induced unfolding of a variant of GFP, without the chromophore, occurs in an apparent two-state manner. The calculated midpoint of the equilibrium folding in GdmCl, taken into account using the Molecular Transfer Model (MTM), is in excellent agreement with the experiments. The melting temperatures decrease linearly as the concentrations of GdmCl and urea are increased. The structural features of rarely populated equilibrium intermediates, visible only in free energy profiles projected along a few order parameters, are remarkably similar to those identified in a number of ensemble experiments in GFP with the chromophore. The excellent agreement between simulations and experiments show that the equilibrium intermediates are stabilized by the chromophore. Folding kinetics, upon temperature quench, show that GFP first collapses and populates an ensemble of compact structures. Despite the seeming simplicity of the equilibrium folding, flux to the native state flows through multiple channels and can be described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism. Detailed analysis of the folding trajectories show that both equilibrium and several kinetic intermediates, including misfolded structures, are sampled during folding. Interestingly, the intermediates characterized in the simulations coincide with those identified in single molecule pulling experiments. Our predictions, amenable to experimental tests, show that MTM is a practical way to simulate the effect of denaturants on the folding of large proteins.

Broader adoption of microbial synthesis is hampered by a limited number of high-yielding natural pathways for molecules with the desired physical properties, as well as the difficulty in functionally assembling complex bio-synthetic pathways in heterologous hosts. Here, we address both of these challenges by reporting the adaptation of the butanol bio-synthetic pathway for the synthesis of odd-chain molecules and the development of a complementary modular toolkit to facilitate pathway construction, characterization, and optimization in engineered Escherichia coli. The modular feature of our pathway enables multi-entry and multiexit biosynthesis of various odd-chain compounds at high efficiency. By varying combinations of the pathway and toolkit enzymes, we demonstrate controlled production of propionate, trans-2-pentenoate, valerate, and pentanol, compounds with applications that include biofuels, antibiotics, biopolymers, and aroma chemicals. Importantly, and in contrast to a previously used method to identify limitations in heterologous amorphadiene production, our bypass strategy was effective even without the presence of freely membrane-diffusible substrates. This approach should prove useful for optimization of other pathways that use CoA-derivatized intermediates, including fatty acid beta-oxidation and the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid synthesis.

Biological systems composed of modular parts with clearly defined interactions are generally easier to manipulate than complex systems exhibiting a large number of subtle interactions. However, recreating the function of a naturally complex system with simple modular parts can increase fragility. Here, inspired by scaffold-directed signaling in higher organisms, we modularize prokaryotic signal transduction to allow programmable redirection of phosphate flux from a histidine kinase to response regulators based on targeting by eukaryotic protein-protein interaction domains. Although scaffold-directed colocalization alone was sufficient to direct signaling between components, this minimal system suffered from high sensitivity to changing expression levels of each component. To address this fragility, we demonstrate how to engineer autoinhibition into the kinase so that phosphotransfer is possible only upon binding to the scaffold. This system, in which scaffold performs the dual functions of activating this autoinhibited kinase and directing flux to the cotargeted response regulator, was significantly more robust to varying component concentrations. Thus, we demonstrate that design principles inspired by the complex signal-transduction pathways of eukaryotes may be generalized, abstracted, and applied to prokaryotes using well-characterized parts.

However, direct proof of a population of stem cells in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains elusive. In this study, we enriched for stem-like cells from the SCLC cell line H446 by growing them as spheres in a defined serum-free medium. Sphere-derived cells have increased in vitro clonogenic and in vivo tumorigenic potentials as well as drug-resistant properties. After enrichment for stem-like cells, we used multiple candidate stem cell markers to examine the expression profile and found that the sphere-derived cells contained a higher proportion of cells expressing the stem cell surface markers uPAR and CD133 when compared with parental cells. To identify a selectable marker for the sphere-forming cells, we evaluated the sphere-forming abilities of uPAR(+) and uPAR(-) cells as well as the sphere-forming abilities of CD133(+) and CD133(-) cells. Both CD133(+) and CD133(-) cell fractions were capable of forming spheres, and no statistically significant difference was observed in the sphere-forming efficiency between these two populations. In contrast, cells derived from the uPAR(+) fraction were capable of forming spheres, whereas cells derived from the uPAR(-) fraction remained as single cells. Moreover, uPAR(+) cells efficiently formed transplantable tumors, whereas uPAR(-) cells were unable to initiate tumors when transplanted at equivalent cell numbers. In addition, uPAR(+) cells could differentiate into CD56(+) cells. CK+ cells, and uPAR(-) cells. These data support the existence of a population of tumor sphere-forming cells with stem cell properties in the H446 SCLC cell line. Furthermore, the stem cell population may be enriched in cells expressing the uPAR cell surface marker. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exit from prophase I is controlled by the recombination checkpoint (RC), which, in yeast, represses the meiosis-specific transcription factor Ndt80 required for the expression of B-type cyclins and other M phase regulators. We show that an extended prophase I additionally requires the suppression of latent, mitotic cell-cycle controls by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and its meiosis-specific activator Ama1, which trigger the degradation of M phase regulators and Ndd1, a subunit of a mitotic transcription factor. ama1 Delta mutants exit from prophase I prematurely and independently of the RC, which results in recombination defects and chromosome missegregation. Thus, control of prophase I by meiotic mechanisms depends on the suppression of the alternative, mitotic mechanisms by a meiosis-specific form of the APC/C.

Objective: We compared these 2 groups of patients to understand whether it is possible to define specific STEMI phenotypes associated with outcome based on the cytokine response.

Methods and Results: We compared 109 patients with STEMI in the top IL-6 level (median, 15.6 pg/mL; IL-6(+) STEMI) with 96 in the bottom IL-6 level (median, 1.7 pg/mL; IL-6(-) STEMI) and 103 matched controls extracted from the multiethnic First Acute Myocardial Infarction study. We found minimal clinical differences between IL-6(+)S TEMI and IL-6(-)STEMI. We assessed the inflammatory profiles of the 2 STEMI groups and the controls by measuring 18 cytokines in blood samples. We exploited clustering analysis algorithms to infer the functional modules of interacting cytokines. IL-6(+) STEMI patients were characterized by the activation of 2 modules of interacting signals comprising IL-10, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and monokine induced by interferon-gamma. IL-10 was increased both in IL-6+ STEMI and IL-6(-) STEMI patients compared with controls. IL-6(+)IL-10(+) STEMI patients had an increased risk of systolic dysfunction at discharge and an increased risk of death at 6 months in comparison with IL-6(-)IL-10(+) STEMI patients. We combined IL-10 and monokine induced by interferon-gamma (derived from the 2 identified cytokine modules) with IL-6 in a formula yielding a risk index that outperformed any single cytokine in the prediction of systolic dysfunction and death.

Conclusions: We have identified a characteristic circulating inflammatory cytokine pattern in STEMI patients, which is not related to the extent of myocardial damage. The simultaneous elevation of IL-6 and IL-10 levels distinguishes STEMI patients with worse clinical outcomes from other STEMI patients. These observations could have potential implications for risk-oriented patient stratification and immune-modulating therapies. (Circ Res. 2012;111:1336-1348.)

Until recently, it was thought that these regulatory networks are composed solely of protein-mediated transcriptional control and signaling systems; consequently, it was thought that cardiac disease involves perturbation of these systems. However, it is becoming evident that RNA, long considered to function primarily as the platform for protein production, may in fact play a major role in most, if not all, aspects of gene regulation, especially the epigenetic processes that underpin organogenesis. These include not only well-validated classes of regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs, but also tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed across the entire genome of humans and other animals.

Cardiovascular effects of ErbB2-targeted cancer therapies provide evidence in humans that ErbB signaling plays a role in the maintenance of cardiac function. These and other studies suggest a conceptual model in which a key function of NRG-1/ErbB signaling is to mediate adaptations of the heart to physiological and pathological stimuli through activation of intracellular kinase cascades that regulate tissue plasticity.

It is now clear that a GPCR coupling to these pathways can be regulated selectively by ligands that differentially drive signaling down one pathway in preference to another. This concept, termed stimulus bias, is revolutionizing receptor biology and drug discovery by providing a means of selectively targeting receptor signaling pathways that have therapeutic impact. Herein, we utilized a novel quantitative method that determines stimulus bias of synthetic GPCR ligands in a manner that nullifies the impact of both the cellular background and the ""natural bias"" of the endogenous ligand. By applying this method to the M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical GPCR, we found that mutation of key residues (Tyr-802.61 and Trp-993.28) in an allosteric binding pocket introduces stimulus bias in response to the atypical ligands AC-42 (4-n-butyl-1-(4-(2-methylphenyl)-4-oxo-1-butyl) piperidine HCl) and 77-LH-28-1 (1-(3-(4-butyl-1-piperidinyl) propyl)-3,3-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone). By comparing stimulus bias factors among receptor internalization, G protein activation, extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling, and receptor phosphorylation, we provide evidence that Tyr-802.61 and Trp-993.28 act either as molecular switches or as gatekeeper residues that introduce constraints limiting the active conformation of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and thereby regulate stimulus bias. Furthermore, we provide evidence that downstream signaling pathways previously considered to be related to each other (i.e. receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and activation of ERK1/2) can act independently.

APRIL binds two different TNF receptors, B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and cylclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), and also interacts independently with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Because APRIL shares binding of the TNF receptors with B cell activation factor, separating the precise signaling pathways activated by either ligand in a given context has proven quite difficult.

However, the optimal cell type and the easy reprogramming approaches that minimize genetic aberrations of parent cells must be considered before generating the iPSCs. This paper reports a method to generate iPSCs from adult human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) without the use of a feeder layer, by ectopic expression of the defined transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC using a polycistronic plasmid. The results, based on the expression of pluripotent marker, demonstrated that the iPSCs have the characteristics similar to those of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The iPSCs differentiated into three embryonic germ layers both in vitro by embryoid body generation and in vivo by teratoma formation after being injected into immunodeficient mice. More importantly, the plasmid DNA does not integrate into the genome of human iPSCs as revealed by Southern blotting experiments. Karyotypic analysis also demonstrated that the reprogramming of hADSCs by the defined factors did not induce chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, this technology provides a platform for studying the biology of iPSCs without viral vectors, and can hopefully overcome immune rejection and ethical concerns, which are the two important barriers of ESC applications.

While regulators of certain aspects of steroidogenesis are known, the initial driver of steroidogenesis in the human and rodent fetal testis is unclear. Through comparative analysis of rodent fetal testis microarray datasets, 54 candidate fetal Leydig cell-specific genes were identified. Fetal mouse testis interstitial expression of a subset of these genes with unknown expression (Crhr1, Gramd1b, Itih5, Vgll3, and Vsnl1) was verified by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Among the candidate fetal Leydig cell-specific factors, three receptors (CRHR1, PRLR, and PROKR2) were tested for a steroidogenic function using ex vivo fetal testes treated with receptor agonists (CRH, PRL, and PROK2). While PRL and PROK2 had no effect, CRH, at low (approximately 1 to 10) nM concentration, increased expression of the steroidogenic genes Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Scarb1, and Star in GD15 mouse and GD17 rat testes, and in conjunction, testosterone production was increased. Exposure of GD15 fetal mouse testis to a specific CRHR1 antagonist blunted the CRH-induced steroidogenic gene expression and testosterone responses. Similar to ex vivo rodent fetal testes, >= 10 nM CRH exposure of MA-10 Leydig cells increased steroidogenic pathway mRNA and progesterone levels, showing CRH can enhance steroidogenesis by directly targeting Leydig cells.

Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification(3), as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems(4). A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)(5,6). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages(7-9). Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.

NPM1 is preferentially localized in the nucleoli of normal cells, whereas it is also present at the nuclear matrix in cancer cells. However, the biological roles of NPM1 during infection are unknown. Here, by analyzing a pV-deletion mutant, Ad5-dV/TSB, we demonstrate that pV promotes the NPM1 translocation from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm in normal cells, and the NPM1 translocation is correlated with adenoviral replication. Lack of pV causes a dramatic reduction of adenoviral replication in normal cells, but not cancer cells, and Ad5-dV/TSB was defective in viral assembly in normal cells. NPM1 knockdown inhibits adenoviral replication, suggesting an involvement of NPM1 in adenoviral biology. Further, we show that NPM1 interacts with empty adenovirus particles which are an intermediate during virion maturation by immunoelectron microscopy. Collectively, these data implicate that pV participates in a process of viral assembly through NPM1. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Yet, genome annotation, comparison, and modeling remain a major bottleneck to the translation of sequence information into biological knowledge, hence computational analysis tools are continuously being developed for rapid genome annotation and interpretation. Among the earliest, most comprehensive resources for prokaryotic genome analysis, the SEED project, initiated in 2003 as an integration of genomic data and analysis tools, now contains >5,000 complete genomes, a constantly updated set of curated annotations embodied in a large and growing collection of encoded subsystems, a derived set of protein families, and hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Until recently, however, maintaining current copies of the SEED code and data at remote locations has been a pressing issue. To allow high-performance remote access to the SEED database, we developed the SEED Servers (http://www.theseed.org/servers): four network-based servers intended to expose the data in the underlying relational database, support basic annotation services, offer programmatic access to the capabilities of the RAST annotation server, and provide access to a growing collection of metabolic models that support flux balance analysis. The SEED servers offer open access to regularly updated data, the ability to annotate prokaryotic genomes, the ability to create metabolic reconstructions and detailed models of metabolism, and access to hundreds of existing metabolic models. This work offers and supports a framework upon which other groups can build independent research efforts. Large integrations of genomic data represent one of the major intellectual resources driving research in biology, and programmatic access to the SEED data will provide significant utility to a broad collection of potential users.

It activates Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt and STAT activation pathways. These are the main pathways for cell proliferation and survival. We have developed two mathematical models to relate to the different EGFR signaling in NSCLC and normal cells in the presence or absence of EGFR and PTEN mutations. The dynamics of downstream signaling pathways vary in the disease state and activation of some factors can be indicative of drug resistance. Our simulation denotes the effect of EGFR mutations and increased expression of certain factors in NSCLC EGFR signaling on each of the three pathways where levels of pERK, pSTAT and pAkt are increased. Over activation of ERK, Akt and STAT3 which are the main cell proliferation and survival factors act as promoting factors for tumor progression in NSCLC. In case of loss of PTEN, Akt activity level is considerably increased. Our simulation results show that in the presence of erlotinib, downstream factors i.e. pAkt, pSTAT3 and pERK are inhibited. However, in case of loss of PTEN expression in the presence of erlotinib, pAkt level would not decrease which demonstrates that these cells are resistant to erlotinib.

The mechanisms that regulate this rearrangement in vivo are poorly understood - largely because of the difficulty to visualize filamentous actin (F-actin) structures with sufficient resolution. Here, we use transgenic mice expressing Lifeact-EGFP to visualize F-actin in ECs. We show that in the retina, Lifeact-EGFP expression is largely restricted to ECs allowing detailed visualization of F-actin in ECs in situ. Lifeact-EGFP labels actin associated with cell-cell junctions, apical and basal membranes and highlights actin-based structures such as filopodia and stress fiber-like cytoplasmic bundles. We also show that in the skin and the skeletal muscle, Lifeact-EGFP is highly expressed in vascular mural cells (vMCs), enabling vMC imaging. In summary, our results indicate that the Lifeact-EGFP transgenic mouse in combination with the postnatal retinal angiogenic model constitutes an excellent system for vascular cell biology research. Our approach is ideally suited to address structural and mechanistic details of angiogenic processes, such as endothelial tip cell migration and fusion, EC polarization or lumen formation.

The molecular events underlying axon degeneration are poorly understood. We have developed a novel method to enrich for axoplasm from rodent optic nerve and characterised the early events in Wallerian degeneration using an unbiased proteomics screen. Our detergent-free method draws axoplasm into a dehydrated hydrogel of the polymer poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), which is then recovered using centrifugation. This technique is able to recover axonal proteins and significantly deplete glial contamination as confirmed by immunoblotting. We have used iTRAQ to compare axoplasm-enriched samples from naive vs injured optic nerves, which has revealed a pronounced modulation of proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton. To confirm the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton in injured axons we focused on the RhoA pathway. Western blotting revealed an augmentation of RhoA and phosphorylated cofilin in axoplasm-enriched samples from injured optic nerve. To investigate the localisation of these components of the RhoA pathway in injured axons we transected axons of primary hippocampal neurons in vitro. We observed an early modulation of filamentous actin with a concomitant redistribution of phosphorylated cofilin in injured axons. At later time-points, RhoA is found to accumulate in axonal swellings and also colocalises with filamentous actin. The actin cytoskeleton is a known sensor of cell viability across multiple eukaryotes, and our results suggest a similar role for the actin cytoskeleton following axon injury. In agreement with other reports, our data also highlights the role of the RhoA pathway in axon degeneration. These findings highlight a previously unexplored area of axon biology, which may open novel avenues to prevent axon degeneration. Our method for isolating CNS axoplasm also represents a new tool to study axon biology.

To gain insights into the global relationship between drugs and their affected metabolic subpathways, we constructed a drug-metabolic subpathway network (DRSN). This network included 3925 significant drug-metabolic subpathway associations representing drug dual effects. Through analyses based on network biology, we found that if drugs were linked to the same subpathways in the DRSN, they tended to share the same indications and side effects. Furthermore, if drugs shared more subpathways, they tended to share more side effects. We then calculated the association score by integrating drug-affected subpathways and disease-related subpathways to quantify the extent of the associations between each drug class and disease class. The results showed some close drugdisease associations such as sex hormone drugs and cancer suggesting drug dual effects. Surprisingly, most drugs displayed close associations with their side effects rather than their indications. To further investigate the mechanism of drug dual effects, we classified all the subpathways in the DRSN into therapeutic and non-therapeutic subpathways representing drug therapeutic effects and side effects. Compared to drug side effects, the therapeutic effects tended to work through tissuespecific genes and these genes tend to be expressed in the adrenal gland, liver and kidney; while drug side effects always occurred in the liver, bone marrow and trachea. Taken together, the DRSN could provide great insights into understanding the global relationship between drugs and metabolic subpathways.

It was recently demonstrated that Borrelia burgdorferi aggregate formation dramatically changes the in vitro response to hostile environments by this pathogen. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that these aggregates are indeed biofilms, structures whose resistance to unfavorable conditions are well documented. We studied Borrelia burgdorferi for several known hallmark features of biofilm, including structural rearrangements in the aggregates, variations in development on various substrate matrices and secretion of a protective extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix using several modes of microscopic, cell and molecular biology techniques. The atomic force microscopic results provided evidence that multilevel rearrangements take place at different stages of aggregate development, producing a complex, continuously rearranging structure. Our results also demonstrated that Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of developing aggregates on different abiotic and biotic substrates, and is also capable of forming floating aggregates. Analyzing the extracellular substance of the aggregates for potential exopolysaccharides revealed the existence of both sulfated and nonsulfated/carboxylated substrates, predominately composed of an alginate with calcium and extracellular DNA present. In summary, we have found substantial evidence that Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of forming biofilm in vitro. Biofilm formation by Borrelia species might play an important role in their survival in diverse environmental conditions by providing refuge to individual cells.

Molecular biology research about this honey bee species is scarce, and genomic information for A. c. cerana is not currently available. Transcriptome and expression profiling data for this species are therefore important resources needed to better understand the biological mechanisms of A. c. cerana. In this study, we obtained the transcriptome information of A. c. cerana by RNA-sequencing and compared gene expression differences between queens and workers of A. c. cerana by digital gene expression (DGE) analysis.

Results: Using high-throughput Illumina RNA sequencing we obtained 51,581,510 clean reads corresponding to 4.64 Gb total nucleotides from a single run. These reads were assembled into 46,999 unigenes with a mean length of 676 bp. Based on a sequence similarity search against the five public databases (NR, Swissport, GO, COG, KEGG) with a cut-off E-value of 10 25 using BLASTX, a total of 24,630 unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology terms, or metabolic pathways. Using these transcriptome data as references we analyzed the gene expression differences between the queens and workers of A. c. cerana using a tag-based digital gene expression method. We obtained 5.96 and 5.66 million clean tags from the queen and worker samples, respectively. A total of 414 genes were differentially expressed between them, with 189 up-regulated and 225 down-regulated in queens.

Lotka provided fundamental formulations for population modeling; less appreciated are his explorations of the underlying material (elemental) basis of life and its implications for ecology and evolution. This paper describes recent developments in ecological and biological stoichiometry that unify these aspects of Lotka's work. Stoichiometrically explicit versions of the Lotka-Volterra equations capture key missing aspects of food web interactions, such as the effects of food quality and nutrient recycling feedbacks, and encompass a richer, and potentially more realistic, set of dynamics than non-stoichiometric models. These stoichiometric models are now being further extended to include the recently discovered effects of excess dietary nutrient content on consumer performance. The multidimensional capacity of stoichiometric models is likely to be of particular value given the pressing need to anticipate the ecological effects of globally dynamic perturbations of multiple chemical elements (e.g. C, N, and P) due to human actions.

Although numerous habitat suitability models have been developed based on ecological data, data quality is often a key, but overlooked issue in the development of such models. This paper analysed the impact of sampling efficiency on the quality of data-driven habitat suitability models. Therefore, models were derived from fish habitat data obtained from two sampling techniques with contrasting efficiency: electrofishing and radio telemetry. Specifically, we developed habitat models for burbot (Lota Iota L) in the River Grote Nete based on radio telemetry data and electrofishing data and compared the performance and ecological relevance of these models. Although both electrofishing and telemetry models selected the presence of hollow banks as the most important input variable, the telemetry models performed substantially better than the electrofishing models. Further, the telemetry models also better reflected the observed burbot habitat preferences within the study area. These telemetry models indicated that burbot prefers hollow banks and that depth and flow velocity conditions in the study area were not limiting for burbot. The presented approach may contribute to the development of more reliable and ecologically relevant habitat suitability models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 1.4- and 1.5-angstrom crystal structures of human alpha-NAGAL complexes reveal the different binding modes of iminosugars compared with glycosides. We show how differences in two functional groups result in >9 kcal/mol of additional binding energy and explain the molecular interactions responsible for the unexpectedly high affinity of the pharmacological chaperones.

In Escherichia coli, pimelate is made by bypassing the strict specificity of the fatty acid synthetic pathway. BioC methylates the free carboxyl of a malonyl thioester, which replaces the usual acetyl thioester primer. This atypical primer is transformed to pimeloyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) methyl ester by two cycles of fatty acid synthesis. The question is, what stops this product from undergoing further elongation? Although BioH readily cleaves this product in vitro, the enzyme is nonspecific, which made assignment of its physiological substrate problematical, especially because another enzyme, BioF, could also perform this gatekeeping function. We report the 2.05-angstrom resolution cocrystal structure of a complex of BioH with pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester and use the structure to demonstrate that BioH is the gatekeeper and its physiological substrate is pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester.

In contrast, efficient natural utilization of -2 PRF has not been demonstrated previously in eukaryotic systems. Like all nidoviruses, members of the Arteriviridae (a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses) express their replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab from two long ORFs (1a and 1b), where synthesis of pp1ab depends on -1 PRF. These polyproteins are posttranslationally cleaved into at least 13 functional nonstructural proteins. Here we report that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and apparently most other arteriviruses, use an additional PRF mechanism to access a conserved alternative ORF that overlaps the nsp2-encoding region of ORF1a in the + 1 frame. We show here that this ORF is translated via -2 PRF at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence (underscores separate ORF1a codons) at an estimated efficiency of around 20%, yielding a transframe fusion (nsp2TF) with the N-terminal two thirds of nsp2. Expression of nsp2TF in PRRSV-infected cells was verified using specific Abs, and the site and direction of frameshifting were determined via mass spectrometric analysis of nsp2TF. Further, mutagenesis showed that the frame-shift site and an unusual frameshift-stimulatory element (a conserved CCCANCUCC motif 11 nucleotides downstream) are required to direct efficient -2 PRF. Mutations preventing nsp2TF expression impair PRRSV replication and produce a small-plaque phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that -2 PRF is a functional gene-expression mechanism in eukaryotes and add another layer to the complexity of arterivirus genome expression.

However, phosphotyrosine accounts for less than 1% of all phosphorylated substrates, and it is typically a very transient event in vivo. These factors complicate the identification of key tyrosine kinase substrates, especially in the context of their extraordinary spatial organization. Here, we describe an approach to identify tyrosine kinase substrates based on their subcellular distribution from within cells. This method uses an unnatural amino acid-modified Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that is expressed within cells and can covalently trap phosphotyrosine proteins on exposure to light. This SH2 domain-based photoprobe was targeted to cellular structures, such as the actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and cellular membranes, to capture tyrosine kinase substrates unique to each cellular region. We demonstrate that RhoA, one of the proteins associated with actin, can be phosphorylated on two tyrosine residues within the switch regions, suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues might modulate RhoA signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. We conclude that expression of SH2 domains within cellular compartments that are capable of covalent phototrapping can reveal the spatial organization of tyrosine kinase substrates that are likely to be important for the regulation of subcellular structures.

Elucidation of the biological mechanisms underlying these effects is an area of considerable interest and investigation, and it is important to determine whether these mechanisms are distinct for different health outcomes or whether there are some common underlying pathways that may account for the effects of disparate prenatal and early postnatal conditions on various health and disease risk phenotypes. We propose that telomere biology may represent a common underlying mechanism connecting fetal programming and subsequent health outcomes. It appears that the initial establishment of telomere length and regulation of telomere homeostasis may be plastic and receptive to the influence of intrauterine and other early life conditions. Moreover, telomere homeostasis in various cell types may serve as a fundamental integrator and regulator of processes underlying cell genomic integrity and function, aging, and senescence over the life span. We advance the hypothesis that context-and time-inappropriate exposures to various forms of physiological stress (maternal-placental-fetal endocrine aberrations and immune, inflammatory, and oxidative stresses) during the intrauterine period of development may alter or program the telomere biology system in a manner that accelerates cellular dysfunction, aging, and disease susceptibility over the life span.

Despite its potentially broad influence in tumour biology and prevalent expression, the value of MIF as a therapeutic target in cancer remains unclear. We sought to validate MIF in tumour models by achieving a complete inhibition of its expression in tumour cells and in the tumour stroma.

METHODS: We used MIF shRNA-transduced B16-F10 melanoma cells implanted in wild-type and MIF-/- C57Bl6 mice to investigate the effect of loss of MIF on tumour growth. Cytokine detection and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to evaluate tumours ex vivo.

RESULTS: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor shRNA inhibited expression of MIF protein by B16-F10 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the loss of MIF in this cell line resulted in a decreased response to hypoxia as indicated by reduced expression of VEGF. In vivo the growth of B16-F10 tumours was inhibited by an average of 47% in the MIF-/- mice compared with wild-type but was unaffected by loss of MIF expression by the tumour cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that microvessel density was decreased in tumours implanted in the MIF-/- mice. Profiling of serum cytokines showed a decrease in pro-angiogenic cytokines in MIF-/- mice.

CONCLUSION: We report that the absence of MIF in the host resulted in slower tumour growth, which was associated with reduced vascularity. While the major contribution of MIF appeared to be in the regulation of angiogenesis, tumour cell-derived MIF played a negligible role in this process.

While it is accepted that in many cases cilia are mainly coupled together by the hydrodynamic velocity field, a clear understanding of which aspects determine the collective wave properties is lacking. It is a difficult problem, because both the behavior of the individual cilia and their coupling together are nonlinear. In this work, we coarse-grain the degrees of freedom of each cilium into a minimal description in terms of a configuration-based phase oscillator. Driving colloidal particles with optical tweezers, we then experimentally investigate the coupling through hydrodynamics in systems of many oscillators, showing that a collective dynamics emerges. This work generalizes to a wider class of systems our recent finding that the non-equilibrium steady state can be understood based on the equilibrium properties of the system, i.e. the positions and orientations of the active oscillators. In this model system, it is possible to design configurations of oscillators with the desired collective dynamics. The other face of this problem is to relate the collective patterns found in biology to the architecture and behavior of individual active elements.

Inbreeding depression is commonly observed in animals and plants. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to genetic processes, epigenetic processes may play an important role in causing inbreeding effects. We compared epigenetic markers of outbred and inbred offspring of the perennial plant Scabiosa columbaria and found that inbreeding increases DNA methylation. Moreover, we found that inbreeding depression disappears when epigenetic variation is modified by treatment with a demethylation agent, linking inbreeding depression firmly to epigenetic variation.

We compared population differentiation (phi'(ST) and F-ST) for the stripes locus-which underlies this colour pattern polymorphism-with neutral microsatellite loci to test for a signature of selection among native and introduced populations. Among native populations, phi'(ST) and F-ST for stripes were lower than expected under the neutral model, suggesting uniform balancing selection. Alternatively, among introduced populations, phi'(ST) and F-ST for stripes did not differ from the neutral model.

It has been proposed that F-420 has an important role in the oxidoreductive reactions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, possibly associated with anaerobic survival and persistence. The protein encoded by Rv0132c has a predicted N-terminal signal sequence and is annotated as an F-420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Here we show that Rv0132c protein does not have the annotated activity. It does, however, co-purify with F-420 during expression experiments in M. smegmatis. We also show that the Rv0132c-F-420 complex is a substrate for the Tat pathway, which mediates translocation of the complex across the cytoplasmic membrane, where Rv0132c is anchored to the cell envelope. This is the first report of any F-420-binding protein being a substrate for the Tat pathway and of the presence of F-420 outside of the cytosol in any F-420-producing microorganism. The Rv0132c protein and its Tat export sequence are essentially invariant in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.

In this paper, we generalize the notion of steady state to the case of general Markov dynamics. Considering an ensemble of independent motions governed by common Markov dynamics, we establish that the entire ensemble attains Poissonian steady states which are quantified by stationary Poissonian intensities and which hold valid also in the case of nonstationary Markov dynamics. The methodology is applied to a host of Markov dynamics, including Brownian motion, birth-death processes, random walks, geometric random walks, renewal processes, growth-collapse dynamics, decay-surge dynamics, Ito diffusions, and Langevin dynamics.

As immunity is a predictor of coral disease and thermal stress susceptibility, a comprehensive understanding of this new field will likely provide amechanistic explanation for ecological-scale trends in reef declines. Recently, several strides within coral immunology document defence mechanisms that are consistent with those of both invertebrates and vertebrates, and which span the recognition, signalling and effector response phases of innate immunity. However, many of these studies remain discrete and unincorporated into the wider fields of invertebrate immunology or coral biology. To encourage the rapid development of coral immunology, we comprehensively synthesize the current understanding of the field in the context of general invertebrate immunology, and highlight fundamental gaps in our knowledge. We propose a framework for future research that we hope will stimulate directional studies in this emerging field and lead to the elucidation of an integrated network of coral immune mechanisms. Once established, we are optimistic that coral immunology can be effectively applied to pertinent ecological questions, improve current prediction tools and aid conservation efforts.

The mutation identified in his blood and buccal cells, c.1771delG, p.Asp591Ilefs*25, appears to be a de novo event, as it was not transmitted by either of his parents. This type of de novo event is rare in MLH1 as only three cases have been reported in the literature so far. Furthermore, the discordant results observed between replication error phenotyping and immunohistochemistry highlight the importance of the systematic use of both pre-screening tests in the molecular diagnosis of Lynch syndrome.

The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry consortium provides a repository of life-science ontologies, which are developed according to a set of shared principles. This consortium has developed an ontology called OBO Relation Ontology aiming at standardizing the different types of biological entity classes and associated relationships. Since ontologies are primarily intended to be used by humans, the use of graphical notations for ontology development facilitates the capture, comprehension and communication of knowledge between its users. However, OBO Foundry ontologies are captured and represented basically using text-based notations. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides a standard and widely-used graphical notation for modeling computer systems. UML provides a well-defined set of modeling elements, which can be extended using a built-in extension mechanism named Profile. Thus, this work aims at developing a UML profile for the OBO Relation Ontology to provide a domain-specific set of modeling elements that can be used to create standard UML-based ontologies in the biomedical domain.

Results: We have studied the OBO Relation Ontology, the UML metamodel and the UML profiling mechanism. Based on these studies, we have proposed an extension to the UML metamodel in conformance with the OBO Relation Ontology and we have defined a profile that implements the extended metamodel. Finally, we have applied the proposed UML profile in the development of a number of fragments from different ontologies. Particularly, we have considered the Gene Ontology (GO), the PRotein Ontology (PRO) and the Xenopus Anatomy and Development Ontology (XAO).

Conclusions: The use of an established and well-known graphical language in the development of biomedical ontologies provides a more intuitive form of capturing and representing knowledge than using only text-based notations. The use of the profile requires the domain expert to reason about the underlying semantics of the concepts and relationships being modeled, which helps preventing the introduction of inconsistencies in an ontology under development and facilitates the identification and correction of errors in an already defined ontology.

Nowadays it is becoming clearer that the complexity of organisms is more related with the organization of its components in networks rather than with the individual behaviour of the components. Among various approaches for inferring networks, Bayesian Networks are very attractive due to their probabilistic nature and flexibility to incorporate interventions and extra sources of information. Recently various attempts to infer networks with different Bayesian Networks approaches were pursued. The specific interest in this paper is to compare the performance of three different inference approaches: Bayesian Networks without any modification; Bayesian Networks modified to take into account specific interventions produced during data collection; and a probabilistic hierarchical model that allows the inclusion of extra knowledge in the inference of Bayesian Networks. The inference is performed in three different types of data: (i) synthetic data obtained from a Gaussian distribution, (ii) synthetic data simulated with Netbuilder and (iii) Real data obtained in flow cytometry experiments.

Results: Bayesian Networks with interventions and Bayesian Networks with inclusion of extra knowledge outperform simple Bayesian Networks in all data sets when considering the reconstruction accuracy and taking the edge directions into account. In the Real data the increase in accuracy is also observed when not taking the edge directions into account.

Conclusions: Although it comes with a small extra computational cost the use of more refined Bayesian network models is justified. Both the inclusion of extra knowledge and the use of interventions have outperformed the simple Bayesian network model in simulated and Real data sets. Also, if the source of extra knowledge used in the inference is not reliable the inferred network is not deteriorated. If the extra knowledge has a good agreement with the data there is no significant difference in using the Bayesian networks with interventions or Bayesian networks with the extra knowledge.

To investigate the physiological function of GPR116 in vivo, we generated adipose tissue specific conditional Gpr116 knockout mice (CKO) and fed them on standard chow or high fat diets. Selective deletion of Gpr116 in adipose tissue caused a pronounced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice, especially when challenged with a high fat diet. Biochemical analysis revealed a more severe hepatosteatosis in CKO mice. Additionally, we found that CKO mice showed a lowered concentration of circulating adiponectin and an increased level of serum resistin. Our study suggests that GPR116 may play a critical role in controlling adipocyte biology and systemic energy homeostasis. (C) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The homologous scaffold was detected by an in silica analysis that established the spatial and electrostatic congruence of the active site of a Class B2 CphA metallo-beta-lactamase from Aeromonas hydrophila to the active site of VAP. The tested beta-lactam compounds did not inhibit Escherichia coil or shrimp alkaline phosphatase, which could be ascribed to the lower congruence indicated by CLASP. There was no discernible beta-lactamase activity in the tested alkaline phosphatases. This is the first time a scaffold recognizing imipenem in an alkaline phosphatase (VAP) has been demonstrated.

When filaments are not fixed to the cell periphery, a situation found both in vivo and in vitro, we observe that the basic dynamics of streaming are closely related to those of a nonmotile stresslet suspension. Under this model, it is demonstrated that confinement makes possible a stable circulating state; a linear stability analysis reveals an activity threshold for spontaneous autocirculation.

Lipids and proteins play cooperative roles in the fusion process, which is triggered by the acidic pH inside the endosome. This acidic environment induces many changes in glycoprotein conformation and allows the action of a highly conserved hydrophobic sequence, the fusion peptide (FP). Despite the large volume of information available on the virus-triggered fusion process, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind flavivirus-cell membrane fusion. Here, we evaluated the contribution of a natural single amino acid difference on two flavivirus FPs, FLA(G) ((98)DRGWGNGCGLFGK(110)) and FLA(H) ((98)DRGWGNHCGLFGK(110)), and investigated the role of the charge of the target membrane on the fusion process. We used an in silico approach to simulate the interaction of the FPs with a lipid bilayer in a complementary way and used spectroscopic approaches to collect conformation information. We found that both peptides interact with neutral and anionic micelles, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed the interaction of the FPs with the lipid bilayer. The participation of the indole ring of Trp appeared to be important for the anchoring of both peptides in the membrane model, as indicated by MD simulations and spectroscopic analyses. Mild differences between FLA(G) and FLA(H) were observed according to the pH and the charge of the target membrane model. The MD simulations of the membrane showed that both peptides adopted a bend structure, and an interaction between the aromatic residues was strongly suggested, which was also observed by circular dichroism in the presence of micelles. As the FPs of viral fusion proteins play a key role in the mechanism of viral fusion, understanding the interactions between peptides and membranes is crucial for medical science and biology and may contribute to the design of new antiviral drugs.

Recent studies have indicated that the Notch signalling pathway is important in PDAC initiation and maintenance, although the specific cell biological roles of the pathway remain to be established. Here we sought to examine this question in established pancreatic cancer cell lines using the gamma-secretase inhibitor IX (GSI IX) to inactivate Notch. Based on the known roles of Notch in development and stem cell biology, we focused on effects on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and on pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells. We analyzed the effect of the GSI IX on growth and epithelial plasticity of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and on the tumorigenicity of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells. Notably, apoptosis was induced after GSI IX treatment and EMT markers were selectively targeted. Furthermore, under GSI IX treatment, decline in the growth of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells was observed in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. This study demonstrates a central role of Notch signalling pathway in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and identifies an effective approach to inhibit selectively EMT and suppress tumorigenesis by eliminating pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells.

The first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to four new species are still being found every year. Extrapolation of the discovery curve suggests that there is still a substantial pool of undiscovered human virus species, although an apparent slow-down in the rate of discovery of species from different families may indicate bounds to the potential range of diversity. More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human hosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A few possible predictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of phylogenetically conserved cell receptors. It seems almost inevitable that new human viruses will continue to emerge, mainly from other mammals and birds, for the foreseeable future. For this reason, an effective global surveillance system for novel viruses is needed.

Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are crucial mediators of antiviral responses(1) and their transcription is regulated by a variety of transcription factors(2); principal among these is the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)(3). The IRF gene regulatory networks are complex and contain multiple feedback loops. The tools of systems biology are well suited to elucidate the complex interactions that give rise to precise coordination of the interferon response. Here we have used an unbiased systems approach to predict that a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, FOXO3, is a negative regulator of a subset of antiviral genes. This prediction was validated using macrophages isolated from Foxo3-null mice. Genome-wide location analysis combined with gene deletion studies identified the Irf7 gene as a critical target of FOXO3. FOXO3 was identified as a negative regulator of Irf7 transcription and we have further demonstrated that FOXO3, IRF7 and IFN-I forma coherent feed-forward regulatory circuit. Our data suggest that the FOXO3-IRF7 regulatory circuit represents a novel mechanism for establishing the requisite set points in the interferon pathway that balances the beneficial effects and deleterious sequelae of the antiviral response.

A highly convergent first generation synthesis led to the complete stereochemical assignment and demonstrated that psymberin and irciniastatin A are identical compounds. This synthesis featured a diastereoselective aldol coupling between the aryl fragment and a central tetrahydropyran core and a novel one-pot procedure to convert an amide, via intermediacy of a sensitive methyl imidate, to the N-acyl aminal reminiscent of psymberin. The highlights of the second generation synthesis include an efficient iridium-catalyzed enantioselective bisallylation of neopentyl glycol and a stepwise Sonogashira coupling/cycloisomerization/reduction sequence to construct the dihydroisocoumarin unit. The two synthetic avenues were achieved in 17-18 steps (longest linear sequence, similar to 14-15 isolations) from 3 fragments prepared in 7-8 (first generation) and 3-8 (second generation) steps each.

We have previously shown that triptolide, a diterpenoid, is effective against pancreatic cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. However, triptolide is poorly soluble in water, limiting its clinical use. We therefore synthesized a water-soluble analog of triptolide, named Minnelide. The efficacy of Minnelide was tested both in vitro and in multiple independent yet complementary in vivo models of pancreatic cancer: an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer using human pancreatic cancer cell lines in athymic nude mice, a xenograft model where human pancreatic tumors were transplanted into severe combined immunodeficient mice, and a spontaneous pancreatic cancer mouse model (KRas(G12D); Trp53(R172H); Pdx-1Cre). In these multiple complementary models of pancreatic cancer, Minnelide was highly effective in reducing pancreatic tumor growth and spread, and improving survival.

Early germline-like cells spontaneously appeared in L929 cells and further differentiated into oocyte-like cells. These germline-like cells can, in turn, develop into blastocyst-like structures in vitro and cause teratocarcinomas in vivo, which is consistent with natural germ cells in function. Generation of germline-like cells from somatic tumors might provide a novel way to understand why somatic cancer cells have strong features of embryonic/germline development.

In WIK fish, males with higher observed heterozygocity were more active reproductively and more successful in securing parentage, but these relationships were not apparent in the BLD01 fish. The frequency of reproductive behaviors increased in WIK zebrafish for exposure to 0.4 ng/L EE2, which was not apparent in the BLD01 zebrafish. The different strains showed the same threshold for hepatic vitellogenin gene (vtg) induction (2.2 ng EE2/L), but results suggested an elevated response level in the BLD01. There were no effects on total egg production up to 2.2 ng EE2/L in either population; however, there was reduced egg fertilization rate at 2.2 ng EE2/L in the BLD01 fish. These results show consistency in the general responses to EE2 between these two genetically divergent strains of zebrafish, but also illustrate differences in their breeding biology and response sensitivities.

Notably, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are antidepressant agents increasingly prescribed to manage antenatal mood disorders, and depressed maternal mood per se during pregnancy impacts infant behavior, also raising concerns about long-term consequences following such developmental exposure. We studied whether infants' language development is altered by prenatal exposure to SRIs and whether such effects differ from exposure to maternal mood disturbances. Infants from non-SRI-treated mothers with little or no depression (control), depressed but non-SRI-treated (depressed-only), and depressed and treated with an SRI (SRI-exposed) were studied at 36 wk gestation (while still in utero) on a consonant and vowel discrimination task and at 6 and 10 mo of age on a nonnative speech and visual language discrimination task. Whereas the control infants responded as expected (success at 6 mo and failure at 10 mo) the SRI-exposed infants failed to discriminate the language differences at either age and the depressed-only infants succeeded at 10 mo instead of 6 mo. Fetuses at 36 wk gestation in the control condition performed as expected, with a response on vowel but not consonant discrimination, whereas the SRI-exposed fetuses showed accelerated perceptual development by discriminating both vowels and consonants. Thus, prenatal depressed maternal mood and SRI exposure were found to shift developmental milestones bidirectionally on infant speech perception tasks.

Here, we report the high resolution (1.35 angstrom) structure of EGFP crystallised in its untagged sequence form that reveals the combined impact of the F64L and S65T, that give rise to improved folding and spectral characteristics. The overall structure of EGFP is very similar to wt GFP, forming the classical beta-barrel fold with the chromophore containing helix running through the core of the structure. Replacement of Phe64 with Leu in EGFP results in subtle rearrangement of hydrophobic core packing close to the chromophore including the reduction in surface exposure of two hydrophobic residues. Replacement of Ser65 with Thr has a significant impact on the local hydrogen bond network in the vicinity of the chromophore. Detailed analysis of electron density reveals that several residues close to the chromophore occupy at least two distinct conformations. This includes Glu222 that defines the charged state on the chromophore, with the two conformations having slightly different effects on the hydrogen bond network surrounding the chromophore. Hence, the reported high-resolution structure of EGFP has provided a long overdue molecular description of one of the most important fluorescent protein variants currently in general use.

Tospoviruses cause significant economic damage to a wide range of crops in many parts of the world. The genetic or molecular basis of the continued emergence of new tospoviruses and new hosts is not well understood though it is generally accepted that reassortment and/or genetic complementation among the three genomic segments of individual viruses could be contributing to this variability since plants infected with more than one tospovirus are not uncommon in nature.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Two distinct and economically important tospoviruses, Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), were investigated for inter-virus interactions at the molecular level in dually-infected plants. Datura (Datura stramonium) is a permissive host for TSWV, while it restricts the movement of IYSV to inoculated leaves. In plants infected with both viruses, however, TSWV facilitated the selective movement of the viral gene silencing suppressor (NSs) gene of IYSV to the younger, uninoculated leaves. The small RNA expression profiles of IYSV and TSWV in single- and dually-infected datura plants showed that systemic leaves of dually-infected plants had reduced levels of TSWV N gene-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). No TSWV NSs-specific siRNAs were detected either in the inoculated or systemic leaves of dually-infected datura plants indicating a more efficient suppression of host silencing machinery in the presence of NSs from both viruses as compared to the presence of only TSWV NSs.

Conclusion/Significance: Our study identifies a new role for the viral gene silencing suppressor in potentially modulating the biology and host range of viruses and underscores the importance of virally-coded suppressors of gene silencing in virus infection of plants. This is the first experimental evidence of functional complementation between two distinct tospoviruses in the Bunyaviridae family.

However, in the model system of Drosophila larvae this oftentimes proves difficult due to limitations in imaging capabilities. Using the larval wing imaginal disc, we show that both overall growth, as well as the creation of patterns such as the distinction between the anterior(A) and posterior(P) compartments and the dorsal(D) and ventral(V) compartments can be studied directly by imaging the wing disc as it develops inside a larva. Imaged larvae develop normally, as can be seen by the overall growth curve of the wing disc. Yet, the fact that we can follow the development of individual discs through time provides the opportunity to simultaneously assess individual variability. We for instance find that growth rates can vary greatly over time. In addition, we observe that mechanical forces act on the wing disc within the larva at times when there is an increase in growth rates. Moreover, we observe that A/P boundary formation follows the established sequence and a smooth boundary is present from the first larval instar on. The division of the wing disc into a dorsal and a ventral compartment, on the other hand, develops quite differently. Contrary to expectation, the specification of the dorsal compartment starts with only one or two cells in the second larval instar and a smooth boundary is not formed until the third larval instar.

By varying repeat length, we generated expression libraries that incrementally and predictably sample gene expression levels over a 1,000-fold range. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by creating a bistable switch library that programmatically samples the expression space to balance the two states of the switch, and we illustrate the need for tuning by showing that the switch's behavior is sensitive to host context. Further, we show that mutation rates of the repeats are controllable in vivo for stability or for targeted mutagenesis-suggesting a new approach to optimizing gene networks via directed evolution. This tuning methodology should accelerate the process of engineering functionally complex gene networks.

The regulation of actin assembly and modulation of filament mechanical properties are critical for proper actin function. It is well established that physiological salt concentrations promote actin assembly and alter the overall bending mechanics of assembled filaments and networks. However, the molecular origins of these salt-dependent effects, particularly if they involve nonspecific ionic strength effects or specific ion-binding interactions, are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that specific cation binding at two discrete sites situated between adjacent subunits along the long-pitch helix drive actin polymerization and determine the filament bending rigidity. We classify the two sites as ""polymerization"" and ""stiffness"" sites based on the effects that mutations at the sites have on salt-dependent filament assembly and bending mechanics, respectively. These results establish the existence and location of the cation-binding sites that confer salt dependence to the assembly and mechanics of actin filaments.

One long-standing hypothesis, based on similarities in neuronal connectivity, proposes that homologs of the layer 4 input and layer 5 output neurons of neocortex are present in the avian forebrain, where they contribute to specific nuclei rather than to layers. We devised a molecular test of this hypothesis based on layer-specific gene expression that is shared across rodent and carnivore neocortex. Our findings establish that the layer 4 input and the layer 5 output cell types are conserved across the amniotes, but are organized into very different architectures, forming nuclei in birds, cortical areas in reptiles, and cortical layers in mammals.

Most studies of the evolution of new pathways have focused on the origins and quality of function of the enzymes involved. However, there is an additional layer of complexity that has received less attention. Introduction of a novel pathway into an existing metabolic network can result in inhibitory cross-talk due to adventitious interactions between metabolites and macromolecules that have not previously encountered one another. Here, we report a thorough examination of inhibitory cross-talk between a novel metabolic pathway for synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the existing metabolic network of Escherichia coli. We demonstrate multiple problematic interactions, including (i) interference by metabolites in the novel pathway with metabolic processes in the existing network, (ii) interference by metabolites in the existing network with the function of the novel pathway, and (iii) diversion of metabolites from the novel pathway by promiscuous activities of enzymes in the existing metabolic network. Identification of the mechanisms of inhibitory cross-talk can reveal the types of adaptations that must occur to enhance the performance of a novel metabolic pathway as well as the fitness of the microbial host. These findings have important implications for evolutionary studies of the emergence of novel pathways in nature as well as genetic engineering of microbes for ""green"" manufacturing processes.

In animal models, estrogen protects females from vascular injury and inhibits atherosclerosis. These effects are mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs), which, when bound to estrogen, can bind to DNA to directly regulate transcription. ERs can also activate several cellular kinases by inducing a rapid nonnuclear signaling cascade. However, the biological significance of this rapid signaling pathway has been unclear.

Methods and Results-In the present study, we develop a novel transgenic mouse in which rapid signaling is blocked by overexpression of a peptide that prevents ERs from interacting with the scaffold protein striatin (the disrupting peptide mouse). Microarray analysis of ex vivo treated mouse aortas demonstrates that rapid ER signaling plays an important role in estrogen-mediated gene regulatory responses. Disruption of ER-striatin interactions also eliminates the ability of estrogen to stimulate cultured endothelial cell migration and to inhibit cultured vascular smooth muscle cell growth. The importance of these findings is underscored by in vivo experiments demonstrating loss of estrogen-mediated protection against vascular injury in the disrupting peptide mouse after carotid artery wire injury.

Conclusions-Taken together, these results support the concept that rapid, nonnuclear ER signaling contributes to the transcriptional regulatory functions of ER and is essential for many of the vasoprotective effects of estrogen. These findings also identify the rapid ER signaling pathway as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic agents. (Circulation. 2012;126:1993-2004.)

","Abstract: The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has become an important treatment option for melanoma patients, the majority of whom have a BRAF(V600E) mutation driving their malignancy. However, this same agent does not generally benefit colon cancer patients who have the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Recent work suggests that BRAF(V600E) inhibition by vemurafenib results in decreased negative feedback to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and that the different clinical responses are due to differences in the amount of EGFR present in these two cancers. The experimental work that identified the feedback signaling was an elegant mix of functional genomic approaches and focused, hypothesis-driven cellular and molecular biology. The results of these studies suggest that combined treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven colon cancers with both vemurafenib and EGFR inhibitors is worth clinical evaluation.

This study was conducted on eight coffee agroforests in Costa Rica, in order to identify particular mechanisms preventing nutrient leaching losses. First, we examined how nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) leaching losses differed between coffee agroforests amended with mineral or organic fertilizers. Monthly N and P concentrations were measured in soil water using tension lysimeters (at 15 and 100 cm) between October 2008 and September 2009, and a water balance model was developed to estimate annual nutrient leaching losses from these agroforests. Second, we examined the effects of human interventions (fertilizer type and quantity), biology (shade trees), and chemistry (soil properties) on nutrient leaching losses. Despite differences in the quantity and form of fertilizer inputs, N and P losses at 100 cm did not differ significantly between organically and conventionally managed agroforests (119 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 1.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Rather, N losses declined linearly with increasing shade tree biomass, which is determined by farmers. Phosphorus losses, on the other hand, declined with increasing soil iron pools, which are independent of management decisions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ET-1 modulates cardiac contractility, systemic and renal vascular resistance, salt and water renal reabsorption, and glomerular function. ET-1 is responsible for a variety of cellular events: contraction, proliferation, apoptosis, etc. These effects take place after the activation of the two endothelin receptors ETA and ETB, which are present - among others - on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, glomerular and tubular cells of the kidney. The complex and numerous intracellular pathways, which can be contradictory in term of functional response depending on the receptor type, cell type and physiological situation, are described in this review. Many diseases share an enhanced ET-1 expression as part of the pathophysiology. However, the use of endothelin blockers is currently restricted to pulmonary arterial hypertension, and more recently to digital ulcer. The complexity of the endothelin system does not facilitate the translation of the molecular knowledge to clinical applications. Endothelin antagonists can prevent disease development but secondary undesirable effects limit their usage. Nevertheless, the increasing understanding of the effects of ET-I on the cardiac and renal physiology maintains the endothelin system as a promising therapeutic target. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Two cognate receptors, EDNRA and EDNRB are constitutively expressed in the ovary, and mediate the regulatory endothelin actions. However, the physiological significance of the presence of the two receptors that often elicit opposite responses upon activation by an endothelin is yet to be determined. This study was proposed to test the hypothesis that both receptors are present in the ovary to lend an endothelin a finite regulation of ovulation.

Main methods: A rescued EDNRB knockout (rEDNRB-KO) mouse that is deficient of EDNRB expression in all cells but adrenergic cell lineage was used to test the impact of the loss of function of EDNRB on ovulation. The EDNRB gene deletion and its confirmation at mRNA level were assessed by molecular biology techniques, and the number and size of corpus lutea was determined by ovarian histology.

Key findings: Female rEDNRB-KO mice had larger litter sizes (numbers of pups per birth) and their ovaries contained more corpora lutea than wild type littermates.

Significance: This result shows that without EDNRB excessive ovulation occurs, suggesting a role of EDNRB in having the extent of ovulation confined. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The potential clinical relevance of this receptor has been suggested from numerous studies that have identified GPER expression in breast, endometrial, ovarian and other cancers. Thus GPER can be considered a candidate biomarker and target for non-invasive imaging and therapy. We have designed and synthesized a series of organometallic tricarbonyl-rhenium complexes conjugated to a GPER-selective small molecule derived from tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c] quinoline. The activity and selectivity of these chelates in GPER-mediated signaling pathways were evaluated. These results demonstrate that GPER targeting characteristics depend strongly on the structure of the chelate and linkage. Ethanone conjugates functioned as agonists, a 1,2,3-triazole spacer yielded an antagonist, and derivatives with increased steric volume exhibited decreased activities. Promising GPER selectivity was observed, as none of the complexes interacted with the nuclear estrogen receptors. Radiolabeling with technetium-99m in aqueous media was efficient and gave radioligands with high radiochemical yields and purity. These chelates have favorable physicochemical properties, show excellent stability in biologically relevant media, exhibit receptor specificity and are promising candidates for continuing development as diagnostic imaging agents targeting GPER expression in cancer.

In normoxic condition, PHD2 triggers the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1 alpha) that induces the expression of hypoxia response genes. Therefore the correct function of PHD2 would inhibit angiogenesis and consequent metastasis of tumor cells in normoxic condition. PHD2 mutations were reported in some common cancers. However, high levels of HIF-1 alpha protein were observed even in normoxic metastatic tumors with normal expression of wild type PHD2. PHD2 malfunctions due to protein misfolding may be the underlying reason of metastasis and invasion in such cases. In this study, we scrutinize the unfolding pathways of the PHD2 catalytic domain's possible species and demonstrate the properties of their unfolding states by computational approaches. Our study introduces the possibility of aggregation disaster for the prominent species of PHD2 during its partial unfolding. This may justify PHD2 inability to regulate HIF-1 alpha level in some normoxic tumor types.

Although temporal patterns of phenotypic gene expression have been relatively well characterized during the course of differentiation, coincident patterns of endogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factor expression that accompany pluripotent stem cell differentiation remain much less well-defined. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the global dynamic profiles of ECM and growth factor genes associated with early stages of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Gene expression analysis of ECM and growth factors by ESCs differentiating as embryoid bodies for up to 14 days was assessed using PCR arrays (172 unique genes total), and the results were examined using a variety of data mining methods. As expected, decreases in the expression of genes regulating pluripotent stem cell fate preceded subsequent increases in morphogen expression associated with differentiation. Pathway analysis generated solely from ECM and growth factor gene expression highlighted morphogenic cell processes within the embryoid bodies, such as cell growth, migration, and intercellular signaling, that are required for primitive tissue and organ developmental events. In addition, systems analysis of ECM and growth factor gene expression alone identified intracellular molecules and signaling pathways involved in the progression of pluripotent stem cell differentiation that were not contained within the array data set. Overall, these studies represent a novel framework to dissect the complex, dynamic nature of the extracellular biochemical milieu of stem cell microenvironments that regulate pluripotent cell fate decisions and morphogenesis.

One concern regarding NMR studies of frozen solution protein samples at low temperatures is that they may have poor linewidths, thus preventing high-resolution studies. To learn more about how the solvent shell composition and temperature affects the protein linewidth, we recorded H-1, H-2, and C-13 spectra of ubiquitin in frozen water and frozen glycerol-water solutions at different temperatures. We found that the C-13 protein linewidths generally increase with decreasing temperature. This line broadening was found to be inhomogeneous and independent of proton decoupling. In pure water, we observe an abrupt line broadening with the freezing of the bulk solvent, followed by continuous line broadening at lower temperatures. In frozen glycerol-water, we did not observe an abrupt line broadening and the NMR lines were generally narrower than for pure water at the same temperature. H-1 and H-2 measurements characterizing the dynamics of water that is in exchange with the protein showed that the C-13 line broadening is relatively independent from the arrest of isotropic water motions.

However, Ogino et al. make an assumption that epidemiology has previously not included pathology or modern technologies in epidemiologic studies and that there is a unique need for the specialty of MPE. The new molecular pathology is yet another technique that can improve epidemiologic investigations. There is a long tradition of combining good pathology with epidemiologic research, especially in studies of cardiovascular disease. Large epidemiologic studies have successfully integrated specialty expertise in a collaborative and mutually beneficial approach to test specific hypotheses. The author is concerned that MPE techniques, whether they involve metabolomics, genomics, proteomics, or microarrays, will come to drive epidemiologic studies without any specific hypothesis-testing or unique population characteristics.

How functionally differentiated cells already committed to a specific cell lineage can transdifferentiate into other cell types is a key question in cell biology and regenerative medicine. In the present study we show that porcine ovarian follicular GCs (granulosa cells) can transdifferentiate into osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo. Pure GCs isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FBS (fetal bovine serum) proliferated and dedifferentiated into fibroblast-like cells. We referred to these cells as DFOG (dedifferentiated follicular granulosa) cells. Microarray analysis showed that DFOG cells lost expression of GC-specific marker genes, but gained the expression of osteogenic marker genes during dedifferentiation. After osteogenic induction, DFOG cells underwent terminal osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization in vitro. Furthermore, when DFOG cells were transplanted subcutaneously into SCID mice, these cells formed ectopic osteoid tissue. These results indicate that DFOG cells derived from GCs can differentiate into osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that GCs provide a useful model for studying the mechanisms of transdifferentiation into other cell lineages in functionally differentiated cells.

In efficacy trials, cancer therapeutics have conventionally been assessed by endpoints that are based on the categorical Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) system. In this article, we make the case for a new paradigm in which therapeutics are assessed on a continuous scale by evidence of efficacy, using a variety of quantitative tools that take advantage of technologic innovations and increasing understanding of cancer biology. The new paradigm relies on randomized comparisons between investigational arms and control arms, as historical controls are unavailable or unreliable for these quantitative measures. We discuss multiple limitations of RECIST, including its overemphasis on tumor regression, concerns about the accuracy of tumor measurements and the validity of comparisons with historical controls, and its inadequacy in disease settings in which tumor measurements on cross-sectional imaging are difficult or uninformative.

Due to the complexity of removing this form of DNA damage, no single DNA repair pathway has been shown to be capable of eradicating ICLs. In eukaryotes, ICL repair is a complex process, principally because several repair pathways compete for ICL repair intermediates in a strictly cell cycle-dependent manner. Yeast cells require a combination of nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination repair and postreplication repair/translesion DNA synthesis to remove ICLs. There are also a number of additional ICL repair factors originally identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, called Pso1 through 10, of which Pso2 has an apparently dedicated role in ICL repair. Mammalian cells respond to ICLs by a complex network guided by factors mutated in the inherited cancer-prone disorder Fanconi anemia (FA). Although enormous progress has been made over recent years in identifying and characterizing FA factors as well as in elucidating certain aspects of the biology of FA, the mechanistic details of the ICL repair defects in FA patients remain unknown. Dissection of the FA DNA damage response pathway has, in part, been limited by the absence of FA-like pathways in highly tractable model organisms, such as yeast. Although S. cerevisiae possesses putative homologs of the FA factors FANCM, FANCJ and FANCP (Mph1, Chl1 and Slx4, respectively) as well as of the FANCM-associated proteins MHF1 and MHF2 (Mhf1 and Mhf2), the corresponding mutants display no significant increase in sensitivity to ICLs. Nevertheless, we and others have recently shown that these FA homologs, along with several other factors, control an ICL repair pathway, which has an overlapping or redundant role with a Pso2-controlled pathway. This pathway acts in S-phase and serves to prevent ICL-stalled replication forks from collapsing into DNA double-strand breaks.

Thus, an understanding of their inactivation mechanisms could be useful for the development of new classes of chemical selective inhibitors. In the marine environment, several bioactive terpenoids possess interesting anti-inflammatory activity, often through covalent and/or noncovalent inactivation of sPLA2. Herein, we report the molecular mechanism of human group IIA phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) inactivation by Scalaradial (SLD), a marine 1,4-dialdehyde terpenoid isolated from the sponge Cacospongia mollior and endowed with a significant anti-inflammatory profile. Our results have been collected by a combination of biochemical approaches, advanced mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular modeling. These suggest that SLD acts as a competitive inhibitor. Indeed, the sPLA2-IIA inactivation process seems to be driven by the noncovalent recognition process of SLD in the enzyme active site and by chelation of the catalytic calcium ion. In contrast, covalent modification of the enzyme by the SLD dialdehyde moiety emerges as only a minor side event in the ligandenzyme interaction. These results could be helpful for the rational design of new PLA2 inhibitors that would be able to selectively target the enzyme active site.

We also determined that components of culture media do not affect the steady-state levels of NO or O-2 in the device. This system provides critical control of NO delivery for in vitro models of NO biology and chemistry. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mutations in the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1/STK11) gene are associated with the pathogenesis of PJS and have been identified in non-PJS patients with sporadic testicular cancers. The mechanisms controlled by LKB1 signaling in Sertoli cell functions and testicular biology have not been described. We have conditionally deleted the Lkb1 gene (Lkb1(cko)) in somatic testicular cells to define the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of the testicular phenotype observed in PJS patients. Focal vacuolization in some of the seminiferous tubules was observed in 4-week-old mutant testes but germ cell development appeared to be normal. However, similar to PJS patients, we observed progressive germ cell loss and Sertoli cell only tubules in Lkb1(cko) testes from mice older than 10 weeks, accompanied by defects in Sertoli cell polarity and testicular junctional complexes and decreased activation of the MAP/microtubule affinity regulating and focal adhesion kinases. Suppression of AMP kinase and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling were also observed in Lkb1(cko) testes. Loss of Tsc1 or Tsc2 copies the progressive Lkb1(cko) phenotype, suggesting that dysregulated activation of mTOR contributes to the pathogenesis of the Lkb1(cko) testicular phenotype. Pten(cko) mice had a normal testicular phenotype, which could be explained by the comparative lack of mTOR activation detected. These studies describe the importance of LKB1 signaling in testicular biology and the possible molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of the testicular defects observed in PJS patients.

Over the past decade, genetic association studies have largely focused on common, easy to measure genetic variants shared between many individuals. These common variants typically have subtle functional consequence and translating the resulting association signals into biological insights can be challenging. In the last few years, exome sequencing has emerged as a cost-effective strategy for extending these studies to include rare coding variants, which often have more marked functional consequences.

The effects of surface properties on cell compatibility of the membranes were elucidated. PPC tended to assemble to independent phases in the composite membranes, while OPC formed uniformly distributed LC domains. As the introduction of LC, phase separation occurred, and the crystallization of PU was disrupted. The surface of PU/LC composite membranes showed fingerprint texture and two-phase morphology. Hydrophilicity of the two types of composite membranes exhibited a reversal tendency with the increase of LC contents. Cells seeded on the composite membranes presented favorable growth when the content of LC was over 30%, especially on PU/OPC complex. The surface morphology, phase separation between LC and PU as well as the type of LC showed significant effects on the cell behaviors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To gain new insights into the biology of this complex protein, we have initiated the molecular characterization of the LRP2 homolog from an oviparous species, the chicken (Gallus gallus). The galline LRP2 cDNA encodes a membrane protein of 4658 residues. Overall, the galline and human proteins are 73% identical, indicating that the avian gene has been well conserved over 300 million years. Unexpectedly, LRP2 transcript and protein levels in the kidney of females and estrogen-treated roosters were significantly higher than those in untreated males. The estrogen-responsiveness of avian LRP2 may be related to the dramatic differences in lipoprotein metabolism between mature roosters and laying hens. Newly identified potential estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) in the human and galline LRP2 gene, and additional SO sites present in the promoter of the chicken gene, are compatible with both direct estrogen induction via the classical ligand-induced ERE pathway and the indirect transcription factor crosstalk pathway engaging the Sp1 sites. In agreement with this assumption, estrogen induction of LRP2 was observed not only in primary cultured chicken kidney cells, but also human kidney cell lines. These findings point to novel regulatory features of the LRP2 gene resulting in sex-specific receptor expression. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phylogenetic relationships of this well-corroborated natural group and diverse clade are critical to not only informing scientific communities of the phylogeny of the order Cypriniformes, the world's largest freshwater fish order, but are key to every area of comparative biology examining the evolution of traits, functional structures, and breeding behaviors to their biogeographic histories, speciation, anagenetic divergence, and divergence time estimates. In the present study, two mitochondrial gene sequences (COI, ND4 + 5) and four single-copy nuclear gene segments (RH1, RAG1, EGR2B, IRBP) were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the Cobitoidea as reconstructed from maximum likelihood (ML) and partitioned Bayesian Analysis (BA). Analyses of the combined mitochondrial/nuclear gene datasets revealed five strongly supported monophyletic Cobitoidea families and their sister-group relationships: Botiidae + (Vaillantellidae + (Cobitidae + (Nemacheilidae + Balitoridae))). These recovered relationships are in agreement with previous systematic studies on the order Cypriniformes and/or those focusing on the superfamily Cobitoidea. Using these relationships, our analyses revealed pattern lineageor ecological-group-specific evolution of these genes for the Cobitoidea. These observations and results corroborate the hypothesis that these group-specific-ancestral ecological characters have contributed in the diversification and/or adaptations within these groups. Positive selections were detected in RH1 of nemacheilids and in RAG1 of nemacheilids and genus Vaillantella, which indicated that evolution of RH1 (related to eye's optic sense) and RAG1 (related to immunity) genes appeared to be important for the diversification of these groups. The balitorid lineage (those species inhabiting fast-flowing riverine habitats) had, as compared with other cobitoid lineages, significantly different dN/dS, dN and dS values for ND4 and IRBP genes. These significant differences are usually indicative of weaker selection pressure, and lineage-specific evolution on genes along the balitorid lineage. Furthermore, within Cobitoidea, excluding balitorids, species living in subtropics had significantly higher dN/dS values in RAG1 and IRBP genes than those living in temperate and tropical zones. Among tropical cobitoids, genes COI, ND5, EGR2B, IRBP and RH1, had a significantly higher mean dS value than those species in subtropical and temperate groups. These findings suggest that the evolution of these genes could also be ecological-group-specific and may have played an important role in the adaptive evolution and diversification of these groups. Thus, we hypothesize that the genes included in the present study were actively involved in lineage- and/or ecological-group-specific evolutionary processes of the highly diverse Cobitoidea. These two evolutionary patterns, both subject to further testing, are hypothesized as integral in the diversification with this major clade of the world's most diverse group of freshwater fishes.

It has attracted great attention due to its invasive nature when transported to new areas in its non-native range. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast (cp) genome of Elodea. Taxonomically Elodea is a basal monocot, and only few monocot cp genomes representing early lineages of monocots have been sequenced so far. The genome is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule 156,700 bp in length, and has a typical structure with large (LSC 86,194 bp) and small (SSC 17,810 bp) single-copy regions separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRs 26,348 bp each). The Elodea cp genome contains 113 unique genes and 16 duplicated genes in the IR regions. A comparative analysis showed that the gene order and organization of the Elodea cp genome is almost identical to that of Amborella trichopoda, a basal angiosperm. The structure of IRs in Elodea is unique among monocot species with the whole cp genome sequenced. In Elodea and another monocot Lemna minor the borders between IRs and LSC are located upstream of rps19 gene and downstream of trnH-GUG gene, while in most monocots, IR has extended to include both trnH and rps19 genes. A phylogenetic analysis conducted using Bayesian method, based on the DNA sequences of 81 chloroplast genes from 17 monocot taxa provided support for the placement of Elodea together with Lemna as a basal monocot and the next diverging lineage of monocots after Acorales. In comparison with other monocots, the Elodea cp genome has gone through only few rearrangements or gene losses. IR of Elodea has a unique structure among the monocot species studied so far as its structure is similar to that of a basal angiosperm Amborella. This result together with phylogenetic analyses supports the placement of Elodea as a basal monocot to the next diverging lineage of monocots after Acorales. So far, only few cp genomes representing early lineages of monocots have been sequenced and, therefore, this study provides valuable information about the course of evolution in divergence of monocot lineages.

In the present study, maturation of germinal vesicle-stage marmoset oocytes were evaluated in the following media: Waymouth medium, Waymouth medium containing porcine follicular fluid (pFF) (Waymouth-pFF medium), and porcine oocyte medium (POM). Oocytes cultured in Waymouth-pFF medium had higher maturation rates to the metaphase II stage than those cultured in Waymouth medium (36.1% vs. 24.8%, respectively, P < 0.05), indicating the suitability of this medium for culturing marmoset oocytes. Hence, maturation of marmoset oocytes cultured in POM was subsequently evaluated. The rate of maturation to the metaphase [stage was significantly higher and degradation rates were significantly lower in oocytes cultured in POM than those cultured in Waymouth medium. In addition, three offspring were successfully obtained after transfer of embryos matured in chemically defined medium. Therefore, we concluded that POM was suitable for marmoset oocyte culture. Furthermore, this was apparently the first report of marmoset offspring derived from oocytes cultured in chemically defined medium. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our study aimed to evaluate CUSPIO biomarkers for the assessment of tumor response to antiangiogenic therapy. CUSPIO imaging was performed in subcutaneous rat C6 gliomas before and 2 days after treatment with the potent VEGF-signaling inhibitor cediranib (n = 12), or vehicle (n = 12). Histological validation of Hoechst 33342 uptake (perfusion), smooth muscle actin staining (maturation), pimonidazole adduct formation (hypoxia) and necrosis were sought. Following treatment, there was a significant decrease in fractional blood volume (-43%, p < 0.01) and a significant increase in hemodynamic vascular functionality (treatment altered ?R2*carbogen from 1.2 to -0.2 s-1, p < 0.05). CUSPIO imaging revealed an overall significant decrease in plasma perfusion (-27%, p < 0.05) following cediranib treatment, that was associated with selective effects on immature blood vessels. The CUSPIO responses were associated with a significant 15% reduction in Hoechst 33342 uptake (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in vascular maturation or necrosis. Additionally, treatment with cediranib resulted in a significant 40% increase in tumor hypoxia (p < 0.05). The CUSPIO imaging method provides novel and more specific biomarkers of tumor vessel maturity and vascular hemodynamics, and their response to VEGF-signaling inhibition, compared to current MR imaging biomarkers utilized in the clinic. Such biomarkers may prove effective in longitudinally monitoring tumor vascular remodeling and/or evasive resistance in response to antiangiogenic therapy.

In daily clinical routine, systemic chemotherapy is still considered the only reasonable therapy despite of encouraging results of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) along with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (HIPEC). The Achilles heel of CRS and HIPEC is appropriate patient selection and precise surgical technique preventing patients from excessive morbidity and mortality. Given these findings, new concepts of second look surgery for high risk patients allow detection of peritoneal spread ahead of clinical symptoms or presence of peritoneal masses reducing perioperative morbidity. In addition, personalized intraperitoneal chemotherapy might further improve outcome by appreciating individual tumor biology. These days, every physician should be aware of CRS and HIPEC for treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies. Since there is now sufficient data for the superiority of CRS and HIPEC to systemic chemotherapy in selected patients, our next goal should be providing this strategy with minimal morbidity and mortality even in the presence of higher tumor load.

RA responses are mediated by transcriptional activation by the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) in cooperation with various types of coregulators at RA-responsive gene promoters. Here, we identified CDK2-associated cullin (CAC1) as a novel type of RAR alpha coregulator that interacts with RAR alpha and inhibits its transcriptional activity. The CoRNR box of CAC1 is required for the binding to and inactivation of RAR alpha. In addition, CAC1 cooperates with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to suppress RAR alpha, probably by associating with HDAC. Finally, depletion of CAC1 increases RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, a response accompanied by significant upregulation of the neuronal marker nestin. From these results, we suggest that CAC1 is a novel corepressor of RAR alpha that cooperates with HDACs and is involved in the regulation of RA-induced cellular differentiation.

We noticed that there is unspecific vascular expression when using fli1a:EGFP transgenic embryos for whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) experiments. We therefore tested whether the residual vector sequence contained in the fli1a:EGFP transgene or the integration of transgene into the genome may cause this expression 'noise' and/or deregulation of gene expression at a genome-wide level. RNA probes were synthesized using two different methods, i.e. vector-based and PCR-based. The vector-based dnmt3 probe showed unspecific vascular expression in fli1a:EGFP embryos, but not in wildtype embryos, by WISH. moreover, we also found that compared to that in wildtype, there were alterations in gene expression at whole-genome level in the fli1a:EGFP embryos. Our finding that the vector sequence contained in the fli1a:EGFP genome causes unspecific vascular expression by WISH and the genome-wide expression profiling is altered in fli1a:EGFP embryos strongly argue that extra caution should be taken for data interpretation when using transgenics, such as fli1a:EGFP, in developmental biology studies.

Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to investigate the design principles governing cell polarization. First, using a coarse-grained computational model, we searched for all possible simple networks that can achieve polarization. All solutions contained one of three minimal motifs: positive feedback, mutual inhibition, or inhibitor with positive feedback. These minimal motifs alone could achieve polarization under limited conditions; circuits that combined two or more of these motifs were significantly more robust. With these design principles as a blueprint, we experimentally constructed artificial polarization networks in yeast, using a toolkit of chimeric signaling proteins that spatially direct the synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Circuits with combinatorial motifs yielded clear foci of synthetic PIP3 that can persist for nearly an hour. Thus, by harnessing localization-regulated signaling molecules, we can engineer simple molecular circuits that reliably execute spatial self-organized programs.

In the current research, we make a major step forward in the development of at-line bioassays by implementation of radioligand receptor binding and functional cellular assays to evaluate bioactvity and selectivity. We demonstrate a new platform for high-resolution metabolic profiling of lead compounds for functional activity and selectivity toward the human histamine H-4 receptor (hH(4)R), a member of the large family of membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors. In this platform analytical chemistry, cell biology and pharmacology are merged. The methodology is based on chromatographic separation of metabolic mixtures by HPLC coupled to high-resolution fractionation onto (multiple) microtiter well plates for complementary assaying. The methodology was used for efficient and rapid metabolic profiling of the drug clozapine and three selective hH(4)R lead compounds. With this new platform metabolites with undesired alterations in target selectivity profiles can be readily identified. Moreover, the parallel identification of metabolite structures. with accurate-mass measurements and MS/MS, allowed identification of liable metabolic 'hotspots' for further lead optimization and plays a central role in the workflow and in this study. The methodology can be easily adapted for use with other receptor screening formats.

Recent studies use biophysical models, genetics, and quantitative imaging to unravel how tissue-level morphogen behavior arises from subcellular events. Moreover, data from several systems show that morphogen gradients, downstream signaling, and the activity of cell-intrinsic transcriptional networks change dynamically during pattern formation. Studies from Drosophila and now also vertebrates suggest that transcriptional network dynamics are central to the generation of gene expression patterns.

This seminal fluid is transferred together with the spermatozoa during mating and induces post-mating changes in the female. Molecular characterization of seminal fluid proteins in the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, is limited, although studies suggest that some of these proteins are biologically active.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We report on the functional annotation of 5914 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the testes and male accessory glands, to identify transcripts encoding putative secreted peptides that might elicit post-mating responses in females. The ESTs were assembled into 3344 contigs, of which over 33% produced no hits against the nr database, and thus may represent novel or rapidly evolving sequences. Extraction of the coding sequences resulted in a total of 3371 putative peptides. The annotated dataset is available as a hyperlinked spreadsheet. Four hundred peptides were identified with putative secretory activity, including odorant binding proteins, protease inhibitor domain-containing peptides, antigen 5 proteins, mucins, and immunity-related sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR-based analyses of a subset of putative secretory protein-encoding transcripts from accessory glands indicated changes in their abundance after one or more copulations when compared to virgin males of the same age. These changes in abundance, particularly evident after the third mating, may be related to the requirement to replenish proteins to be transferred to the female.

Conclusions/Significance: We have developed the first large-scale dataset for novel studies on functions and processes associated with the reproductive biology of Ceratitis capitata. The identified genes may help study genome evolution, in light of the high adaptive potential of the medfly.

The species has a wide geographic distribution from Central America, northern and western South America to Amazonia and Bolivia, and is morphologically variable. All subspecies occur in the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke just outside Manaus, Amazonas State in Brazil, and it can be questioned how they can grow in sympatry and retain their identity. We have studied vegetative variation, flower morphology and, to some degree, reproductive barriers. The species is dioecious, has five-merous, cream to greenish flowers that produce pollen, nectar and scent to attract pollinators. The flowering period is between June and October, and the plants set fruits, one seed in each, between November and April. There was no overlap in flowering period in the study area between two of the presumed subspecies, but both have similar floral morphology and are pollinated by the same species of butterflies and bees. Weare not able to find any clear distributional or morphological discontinuities between the subspecies and we, therefore, suggest that M. guyanensis should be considered a variable species without formally recognised subspecies. Flowers of M. guyanensis are highly ephemeral and persist only for 1 day (similar to 27 h) before falling to the ground.

Twelve animals with skin depigmentation and ulceration were received by the Aquatic Pathology Service, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA, for diagnostic evaluation. Microscopically, lesions in 11 seahorses included multifocal epithelial necrosis and ulceration associated with 2 to 7 mu m diameter, branching, septate fungal hyphae, typically accompanied by deeper infiltration into underlying skeletal muscle. Angioinvasion, with vascular thrombosis and tissue infarction, was a prominent feature in multiple animals. Fungal invasion of one or more internal organs was observed in 4 animals. Hyphae appeared to course freely through tissues and elicited little or no inflammatory response. Fusariosis has been reported sporadically in fish and other aquatic organisms, but identification has often been limited to the genus level based solely on morphologic features. Morphologic characteristics of the fungus isolated from this case were consistent with the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), which includes over 50 members that can only be identified definitively using DNA sequence data. A 3-locus typing scheme identified the isolate as a distinct species/haplotype, designated FSSC 12-a, belonging to a specific lineage that appears adapted to aquatic environments and disease in marine animals. Empirical treatment with itraconazole failed to stop mortalities, and subsequent in vitro antifungal susceptibility data explained a lack of clinical efficacy for this agent.

However, there is scant information available on the biology of these important parasites in aquaculture. The population structure, sex ratio, and breeding status were determined for the pea crab Nepinnotheres novaezelandiae residing in a typical green-lipped mussel Perna canaliculus farm in New Zealand. Of the 324 crabs randomly sampled, there were significantly more female (82.4%) than male (17.6%) crabs found. The vast majority of crabs (87.0%) were sexually mature and of these, females comprised 86.4% and males 13.6%. However, the sex ratio of immature crabs was relatively even, suggesting that male crabs may have higher mortality while searching for mates. Crab size was highly variable, indicating that recruitment to mussels in the farm was continuous. Carapace width ranged from 4.00 to 11.5 mm, with males tending to be smaller with a mean (+/- SE) carapace width of 6.31 +/- 0.16 mm versus females with a carapace width of 8.03 +/- 0.06 mm. The crabs did not show any preference for parasitizing mussels of different sexes. Despite the fact that the mussels were only 10 mo old, most female crabs were sexually mature (Stage V) and 89.3% were gravid. The mean (+/- SE) clutch size was 2592 +/- 579 and clutch size was directly associated with female carapace width. The mussel farm pea crab population was estimated at 126 390 +/- 14 144 individuals, including 93 000 gravid females carrying a total of over 241 million eggs. Overall, the results show that pea crabs rapidly colonize farmed mussels and mature quickly to establish a significant breeding population within the mussel farm, with larval output capable of infecting nearby mussel farms as well as wild populations of bivalves.

They are thus expected to play key roles in the biology of Trypanosomatid parasites, which display complex life cycles and use extracellular cues to modulate cell differentiation. Despite their relevance, structural data of Trypanosomatid MAPKs is lacking. We have now determined the crystal structure of Leishmania major LmaMPK10, a stage-specifically activated MAPK, both alone and in complex with SB203580. LmaMPK10 was observed to be more similar to p38 than to other human MAPKs. However, significant differences could be identified in the catalytic pocket, as well as in potentially regulatory sites in the N-terminal lobe. The modified pocket architecture in LmaMPK10 precludes DFG-in/DFG-out regulatory flipping as observed in mammalian MAPKs. LmaMPK10-nucleotide association was also studied, revealing a potential C-terminal autoinhibitory mechanism. Overall, these data should speed the discovery of molecules interfering with LmaMPK10 functions, with relevance for antileishmanial drug development strategies.

Water-soluble and exfoliated His6-tagSWNTs are prepared and fully characterized. This functional molecular module is able to interact via robust physisorption (p-p stacking) with the sidewall of SWNTs and combines the versatility of small, water-soluble reporters (His6) for hierarchical directed self-assembly (HDSA) and construction of nanocomposites. It is demonstrated that metal coordination bonds with Ni(II) can be used for the supramolecular self assembly of His6-tagSWNTs, generating complex reticulated networks and architectures. The His6-tagSWNTs hard template nanohybrid is further utilized for directed self-assembly with silica nanoparticles. The versatility of the novel hybrids opens a new era for the rational design, smart (bio)functionalization, processing, interfacing, and self assembling of carbon nanotubes for the construction of multicomposites and more complex systems with controllable spatial organization and programmable properties for a wide range of applications in biology, nanoelectronics, and catalysis.

An ideal system would allow facile spatiotemporal manipulation of gene expression within a cell population that is tunable, reversible, repeatable, and can be targeted to diverse DNA sequences. To meet these criteria, a gene regulation system was engineered that combines light-sensitive proteins and programmable zinc finger transcription factors. This system, light-inducible transcription using engineered zinc finger proteins (LITEZ), uses two light-inducible dimerizing proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, GIGANTEA and the LOV domain of FKF1, to control synthetic zinc finger transcription factor activity in human cells. Activation of gene expression in human cells engineered with LITEZ was reversible and repeatable by modulating the duration of illumination. The level of gene expression could also be controlled by modulating light intensity. Finally, gene expression could be activated in a spatially defined pattern by illuminating the human cell culture through a photomask of arbitrary geometry. LITEZ enables new approaches for precisely regulating gene expression in biotechnology and medicine, as well as studying gene function, cell-cell interactions, and tissue morphogenesis.

Here, we use a combination of low-temperature electronic absorption and magnetic circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, resonance Raman, and S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopies to investigate a series of second-sphere variants-F114P, N47S, and F114N in Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin-which modulate hydrogen bonding to and protein-derived dipoles nearby the Cu-S(Cys) bond. Density functional theory calculations correlated to the experimental data allow for the fractionation of the contributions to tuning E-0 into covalent and nonlocal electrostatic components. These are found to be significant, comparable in magnitude, and additive for active H-bonds, while passive H-bonds are mostly nonlocal electrostatic in nature. For dipoles, these terms can be additive to or oppose one another. This study provides a methodology for uncoupling covalency from nonlocal electrostatics, which, when coupled to X-ray crystallographic data, distinguishes specific local interactions from more long-range protein/active interactions, while affording further insight into the second-sphere mechanisms available to the protein to tune the E-0 of electron-transfer sites in biology.

However, the structure of these products, which informs their reactivity in biology, has not been unequivocally established. We report here the complete characterization of the products formed in the addition of superoxide, generated from xanthine oxidase, to several peptide-derived tyrosyl radicals, formed from horseradish peroxidase. RP-HPLC, LC-MS, and NMR experiments indicate that the primary stable products of superoxide addition to tyrosyl radical are para-hydroperwdde derivatives (para relative to the position of the OH in tyrosine) that can be reduced to the corresponding para-alcohol. In the case of glycyl-tyrosine, a stable 3-(1-hydroperoxy-4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-yl)-L-alanine was formed. In tyrosyl-glycine and Leu-enkephalin, which have N-terminal tyrosines, bicyclic indolic para-hydroperoxide derivatives were formed ((2S,3aR,7aR)-3a-hydroperoxy-6-oxo-2,3,3a,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid) by the conjugate addition of the free amine to the cyclohexadienone. It was also found that significant amounts of the para-OH derivative were generated from the hydroxyl radical, formed on exposure of tyrosine-containing peptides to Fenton conditions.

The fabrication of an arbitrary number of identical copies of the region hit by the firing pin and by the breech face is described. The replicas can be (i) handled without damaging the original evidence, (ii) distributed to different law enforcement agencies for comparison against other evidences found on crime scenes or ballistic tests of seized firearms, (iii) maintained on a file by the laboratories. A detailed analysis of the morphological features of the replicas has been carried out by standard microscopy techniques as well as by advanced microscopy such as scanning probe and scanning electron leading to a quantitative morphological characterization of the case heads down to the nanometer scale.

These limitations are severe in developing countries where the lack of resources restricts the potential for basic ecological research. One way in which this limitation has been mitigated is with the use of individual-based spatially explicit population models (SEPMs). We developed a SEPM for the endangered huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) of southern Chile. The goal was to project the population trajectories under three different development scenarios (present conditions, increased livestock density and hydroelectric dams) in southern Chile, identifying key demographic variables associated to landscape features. The model simulated weekly movements, age and general status of all individuals in the population and the landscape in which they lived during a 40-year period. Age-dependent and landscape-related mortality probabilities were applied. Four population sizes and three spatial aggregation patterns were used as initial conditions. Although the model was very sensitive to age-dependent mortality rate, individual landscape perception scale and initial population size and location, the general trend was that of a positive population growth. Livestock and dam scenarios had minimal impacts on population dynamics. Most simulations starting with 100 individuals resulted in extinctions and disaggregated initial location of individuals produced slow rates of population growth, suggesting the existence of a population viability threshold. Our results suggest that the huemul population in the Aysen region has the potential to recover only if limiting factors are kept under control and they highlight the urgency of conducting studies aimed at estimating total population size and distribution together with survival data to improve the conservation plans for this endangered species.

Given a set of genotypes, the haplotype inference problem based on pure parsimony is the problem of finding a minimum set of haplotypes that explains all the given genotypes. The problem is especially important because, while it is fairly inexpensive to obtain genotypes, other approaches to obtaining haplotypes are significantly expensive. There are two types of methods proposed for the problem, namely exact and inexact methods. Existing exact methods guarantee obtaining purely parsimonious solutions but have exponential time-complexities and are not practical for large number or length of genotypes. However, inexact methods are relatively fast but do not always obtain optimum solutions. In this paper, an improved heuristic is proposed, based on which new inexact and exact methods are provided. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods replace the state-of-the-art inexact and exact methods for the problem. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In early development, embryonic morphogenesis results largely from monolayer rearrangement and deformation due to internally generated forces. Later, monolayers act as physical barriers separating the internal environment from the exterior and must withstand externally applied forces. Though resisting and generating mechanical forces is an essential part of monolayer function, simple experimental methods to characterize monolayer mechanical properties are lacking. Here, we describe a system for tensile testing of freely suspended cultured monolayers that enables the examination of their mechanical behavior at multi-, uni-, and subcellular scales. Using this system, we provide measurements of monolayer elasticity and show that this is two orders of magnitude larger than the elasticity of their isolated cellular components. Monolayers could withstand more than a doubling in length before failing through rupture of intercellular junctions. Measurement of stress at fracture enabled a first estimation of the average force needed to separate cells within truly mature monolayers, approximately ninefold larger than measured in pairs of isolated cells. As in single cells, monolayer mechanical properties were strongly dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, myosin, and intercellular adhesions interfacing adjacent cells. High magnification imaging revealed that keratin filaments became progressively stretched during extension, suggesting they participate in monolayer mechanics. This multiscale study of monolayer response to deformation enabled by our device provides the first quantitative investigation of the link between monolayer biology and mechanics.

Acyl-homoserine lactones serve as quorum-sensing signals for many Proteobacteria, and acyl-homoserine lactone signaling is known to control cooperative activities. Quorum-controlled activities vary from one species to another. Quorum-sensing controls a constellation of genes in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which thrives in a number of habitats ranging from soil and water to animal hosts. We hypothesized that there would be significant variation in quorum-sensing regulons among strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from different habitats and that differences in the quorum-sensing regulons might reveal insights about the ecology of P. aeruginosa. As a test of our hypothesis we used RNA-seq to identify quorum-controlled genes in seven P. aeruginosa isolates of diverse origins. Although our approach certainly overlooks some quorum-sensing-regulated genes we found a shared set of genes, i.e., a core quorum-controlled gene set, and we identified distinct, strain-variable sets of quorum-controlled genes, i.e., accessory genes. Some quorum-controlled genes in some strains were not present in the genomes of other strains. We detected a correlation between traits encoded by some genes in the strain-variable subsets of the quorum regulons and the ecology of the isolates. These findings indicate a role for quorum sensing in extension of the range of habitats in which a species can thrive. This study also provides a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which quorum-sensing systems operate, the evolutionary pressures by which they are maintained, and their importance in disparate ecological contexts.

Methods: The QIAsymphony RGQ system (QIAGEN S.A.S., France) combines the extraction/distribution steps on QIAsymphony SP/AS instruments with amplification on a Rotor-Gene Q RT-PCR machine. This system was compared to a strategy combining an extraction step on the NUCLISENS easyMAG platform (bioMerieux) with the CMV R-gene kit (Argene) on 100 whole blood specimens collected from immunocompromised patients of the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, France.

Results: The overall agreement between the two strategies was 86% (kappa coefficient of 0.67); the 14 discrepant results corresponded to low DNA loads. The 62 samples found positive with both tests were correlated (Pearson r coefficient of 0.70, P < 0.01) despite an over quantitation of 0.25 log(10) copies/ml with the easyMAG/Argene strategy (P < 0.001). Very close results were also obtained with a commercial panel of 10 samples with CMV loads ranging from 2.36 to 6.41 log(10) copies/ml. The inter-run and intra-run variability was consistently lower with the QIAGEN platform.

Conclusions: These results validate the performance of the QIAsymphony RGQ system for the routine quantitation of CMV DNA.

We have tested the hypothesis that inulin-type fructans (ITF), by promoting microbial production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), influence cancer cell proliferation outside the gut.

METHODS: Mice transplanted with Bcr-Abl-transfected BaF3 cells, received ITF in their drinking water. Gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and qPCR. Serum Short-chain fatty acids were quantified by UHPLC-MS. Cell proliferation was evaluated in vivo, by molecular biology and histology, and in vitro.

RESULTS: Inulin-type fructans treatment reduces hepatic BaF3 cell infiltration, lessens inflammation and increases portal propionate concentration. In vitro, propionate reduces BaF3 cell growth through a cAMP level-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the activation of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2), a Gi/Gq-protein-coupled receptor also known as GPR43 and that binds propionate, lessens the proliferation of BaF3 and other human cancer cell lines.

CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that the fermentation of nutrients such as ITF into propionate can counteract malignant cell proliferation in the liver tissue. Our results support the interest of FFA2 activation as a new strategy for cancer therapeutics.

Single-gene analyses may not reliably predict biology of PC because of its complex molecular makeup. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling may provide a more informative molecular interrogation of tumours. The primary objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of performing miRNA arrays and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell blocks obtained from fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) that is the commonest diagnostic procedure for suspected PC.

METHODS: MicroRNA expression profiling was performed on FFPE from FNA of suspicious pancreatic masses. Subjects included those who had a pathological diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and others with a non-malignant pancreatic histology. Exiqon assay was used to quantify miRNA levels and qRT-PCR was used to validate abnormal expression of selected miRNAs.

RESULTS: A total of 29 and 15 subjects had pancreatic adenocarcinoma and no evidence of cancer, respectively. The RNA yields per patient varied from 25 to 100 ng. Profiling demonstrated deregulation of over 228 miRNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma of which the top 7 were further validated by qRT-PCR. The expression of let-7c, let-7 f, and miR-200c were significantly reduced in most patients whereas the expression of miR-486-5p and miR-451 were significantly elevated in all pancreas cancer patients. MicroRNAs let-7d and miR-423-5p was either downregulated or upregulated with a significant inter-individual variation in their expression.

Here, we addressed whether analyses of tumour mRNA at the exon level can improve on the predictive power and classification accuracy of gene-based expression profiles using neuroblastoma as a model.

METHODS: In a patient cohort comprising 113 primary neuroblastoma specimens expression profiling using exon-level analyses was performed to define predictive signatures using various machine-learning techniques. Alternative transcript use was calculated from relative exon expression. Validation of alternative transcripts was achieved using qPCR- and cell-based approaches.

RESULTS: Both predictors derived from the gene or the exon levels resulted in prediction accuracies >80% for both event-free and overall survival and proved as independent prognostic markers in multivariate analyses. Alternative transcript use was most prominently linked to the amplification status of the MYCN oncogene, expression of the TrkA/NTRK1 neurotrophin receptor and survival.

CONCLUSION: As exon level-based prediction yields comparable, but not significantly better, prediction accuracy than gene expression-based predictors, gene-based assays seem to be sufficiently precise for predicting outcome of neuroblastoma patients. However, exon-level analyses provide added knowledge by identifying alternative transcript use, which should deepen the understanding of neuroblastoma biology.

For instance, the strength of selection on a cognitive trait has never been estimated in a natural population, and the possibility that positive links with life history variation [1-5] are mitigated by costs [6] or confounded by ecological factors remains unexplored in the wild. We assessed novel problem-solving performance in 468 wild great tits Parus major temporarily taken into captivity and subsequently followed up their reproductive performance in the wild. Problem-solver females produced larger clutches than non-solvers. This benefit did not arise because solvers timed their breeding better, occupied better habitats, or compromised offspring quality or their own survival. Instead, foraging range size and day length were relatively small and short, respectively, for solvers, suggesting that they were more efficient at exploiting their environment. In contrast to the positive effect on clutch size, problem solvers deserted their nests more often, leading to little or no overall selection on problem-solving performance. Our results are consistent with the idea that variation in cognitive ability is shaped by contrasting effects on different life history traits directly linked to fitness [1,3].

Based on an understanding of evolutionary biology, developmental plasticity, and life history theory, one can predict that stressors are an important environmental condition that may influence brain development. In fact, the available empirical evidence appears to support the notion that exposure to excess stress in intrauterine life has the potential to adversely affect short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes with implications for altered susceptibility for mental health disorders in childhood and adult life. In this presentation, we provide a rationale for proposing that endocrine and inflammatory stress mediators are key candidate pathways for programming brain development. These mediators are responsive to a diverse set of intrauterine perturbations and alter key signaling pathways critical for brain development, including but not limited to mammalian target of rapamycin, Wnt (wingless), Sonic hedgehog, and reelin signaling. We suggest that recent advances in neuroimaging and other methods now afford us an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of this important topic.

Because of the dominant importance of surface effects at the nanoscale, long-standing assumptions that are valid for macroscopic systems must be revisited when modeling nanoconfined fluids, because boundary conditions and the confined behavior of liquids are challenging to discern from experiments. To address this issue, here we present a novel coarse-grained model that combines parameters calibrated for water with a dissipative particle dynamics thermostat for the purpose of investigating hydrodynamics under confinement at scales exceeding current capabilities with all-atomistic simulations. Conditions pertaining to slip boundary conditions and confinement emerge naturally from particle interactions, with no need for assumptions a priori. The model is used to systematically investigate the imbibition dynamics of water into cylindrical nanopores of different diameters. Interestingly, we find that the dynamic contact angle depends on the size of the nanopore in a way that cannot be explained through a relationship between contact line velocity and dynamic contact angle, suggesting nonlocal effects of the flow field may be important. Additionally, a size-dependent characteristic time scale for imbibition is found, which could be useful for the interpretation of experiments and design of novel nanofluidic devices. We present the first systematic study that explains how contact angle dynamics and imbibition dynamics vary with nanopore radius. Our modeling approach lays the foundation for broader investigations on the dynamics of fluids in nanoporous materials in conjunction with experimental efforts.

'Predictor Surfaces were developed for studies of more chemically complex systems such as biological materials in order to ensure accurate quantitative analyses and proper chemical modeling for in-depth studies of such systems. Predictor Surfaces are based on approximating nonlinear multivariate model functions by multivariate Taylor expansions which inherently introduce the required coupled and higher-order predictor variables.

As proof-of-principle for the Predictor Surfaces' capabilities, an application from environmental analytical chemistry was chosen. Microalgae cells are known to sensitively adapt to changes in environmental parameters such as pollution and/or nutrient availability and thus have potential as novel in situ sensors for environmental monitoring. These adaptations of the microalgae cells are reflected in their chemical signatures which were then acquired by means of FT-IR spectroscopy. In this study, the concentrations of three nutrients, namely inorganic carbon and two nitrogen containing ions, were chosen. Biological considerations predict that changes in nutrient availability produce a nonlinear response in the cells' biomass composition; it is also known that microalgae need certain nutrient mixes to thrive. The nonlinear Predictor Surfaces were demonstrated to be more accurate in predicting the values of these nutrients' concentrations than principal component regression. For qualitative chemical studies of biological systems, the Predictor Surfaces themselves are a novel tool as they visualize nonlinearities and more importantly the coupling among predictor variables. Thus, they can serve as a novel tool for studies in bioanalytical chemistry, biology, and ecology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was 1) to investigate application of PEG modified GMNPs (PGMNPs) as a drug carrier of the chemotherapy compound doxorubicin (DOX) in vitro; 2) to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of DOX-conjugated PGMNPs (DOX-PGMNPs) using an EMF-guided delivery in vivo.

Methods: First, DOX-PGMNPs were synthesized and the cytotoxicity of DOX-PGMNPs was assessed in vitro. Second, upon intravenous administration of DOX-PMGPNs to H22 hepatoma cell tumor-bearing mice, the DOX biodistribution in different organs (tissues) was measured. The antitumor activity was evaluated using different treatment strategies such as DOX-PMGPNs or DOX-PMGPNs with an EMF-guided delivery (DOX-PGMNPs-M).

Results: The relative tumor volumes in DOX-PGMNPs-M, DOX-PGMNPs, and DOX groups were 5.46 +/- 1.48, 9.22 +/- 1.51, and 14.8 +/- 1.64, respectively (each p < 0.05), following treatment for 33 days. The life span of tumor-bearing mice treated with DOX-PGMNPs-M, DOX-PGMNPs, and DOX were 74.8 +/- 9.95, 66.1 +/- 13.5 +/- 13.5, and 31.3 +/- 3.31 days, respectively (each p < 0.05).

Conclusion: This simple and adaptive nanoparticle design may accommodate chemotherapy for drug delivery optimization and in vivo drug-target definition in system biology profiling, increasing the margin of safety in treatment of cancers in the near future.

In prostate cancer, aggressive cases over-express Tip60 which functions as an androgen receptor co-activator via direct acetylation of lysine residues within the KLKK motif of the receptor hinge region. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterise a Tip60 acetylase inhibitor. High-throughput screening revealed an isothiazole that inhibited both Tip60 and p300 HAT activity. This substance (initially identified as 4-methyl-5-bromoisothiazole) and other isothiazoles were synthesised and assayed against Tip60. Although an authentic sample of 4-methyl-5-bromoisothiazole was inactive against Tip60, in an in vitro HAT assay, 1,2-bis(isothiazol-5-yl)disulfane (NU9056) was identified as a relatively potent inhibitor (IC50 2 mu M). Cellular activity was confirmed by analysis of acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins in a prostate cancer cell line model. NU9056 treatment inhibited cellular proliferation in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines (50% growth inhibition, 8-27 mu M) and induced apoptosis via activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9 in a concentration-and time-dependent manner. Also, decreased androgen receptor, prostate specific antigen, p53 and p21 protein levels were demonstrated in response to treatment with NU9056. Furthermore, pre-treatment with NU9056 inhibited both ATM phosphorylation and Tip60 stabilization in response to ionising radiation. Based on the activity of NU9056 and the specificity of the compound towards Tip60 relative to other HAT enzymes, these chemical biology studies have identified Tip60 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer.

In an attempt to identify and profile the population of ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients, a novel method was developed to separate adherent (AD) and non-adherent (NAD) cells in culture. Twenty-five patients were recruited to this study; 11 chemonaive (CN) and 14 chemoresistant (CR). AD cells from both CN and CR patients exhibited mesenchymal morphology with an antigen profile of mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts. Conversely, NAD cells had an epithelial morphology with enhanced expression of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and cytokeratin 7. NAD cells developed infiltrating tumors and ascites within 12-14 weeks after intraperitoneal (i.p.)injections into nude mice, whereas AD cells remained non-tumorigenic for up to 20 weeks. Subsequent comparison of selective epithelial, mesenchymal and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers between AD and NAD populations of CN and CR patients demonstrated an enhanced trend in mRNA expression of E-cadherin, EpCAM, STAT3 and Oct4 in the NAD population of CR patients. A similar trend of enhanced mRNA expression of CD44, MMP9 and Oct4 was observed in the AD population of CR patients. Hence, using a novel purification method we demonstrate for the first time a distinct separation of ascites cells into epithelial tumorigenic and mesenchymal non-tumorigenic populations. We also demonstrate that cells from the ascites of CR patients are predominantly epithelial and show a trend towards increased mRNA expression of genes associated with CSCs, compared to cells isolated from the ascites of CN patients. As the tumor cells in the ascites of ovarian cancer patients play a dominant role in disease recurrence, a thorough understanding of the biology of the ascites microenvironment from CR and CN patients is essential for effective therapeutic interventions.

Drought stress response involves a large number of molecular pathways and subsequent physiological processes. Therefore, it constitutes an archetypical systems biology model. We first inferred a gene-phenotype network exploiting differences in drought responses of eight sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genotypes to two drought stress scenarios. Large transcriptomic data were obtained with the sunflower Affymetrix microarray, comprising 32423 probesets, and were associated to nine morpho-physiological traits (integrated transpired water, leaf transpiration rate, osmotic potential, relative water content, leaf mass per area, carbon isotope discrimination, plant height, number of leaves and collar diameter) using sPLS regression. Overall, we could associate the expression patterns of 1263 probesets to six phenotypic traits and identify if correlations were due to treatment, genotype and/or their interaction. We also identified genes whose expression is affected at moderate and/or intense drought stress together with genes whose expression variation could explain phenotypic and drought tolerance variability among our genetic material. We then used the network model to study phenotypic changes in less tractable agronomical conditions, i.e. sunflower hybrids subjected to different watering regimes in field trials. Mapping this new dataset in the gene-phenotype network allowed us to identify genes whose expression was robustly affected by water deprivation in both controlled and field conditions. The enrichment in genes correlated to relative water content and osmotic potential provides evidence of the importance of these traits in agronomical conditions.

Despite their importance, mutation rates are some of the most elusive parameters to measure in evolutionary biology. The combination of mutation accumulation (MA) experiments and whole-genome sequencing now makes it possible to estimate mutation rates by directly observing new mutations at the molecular level across the whole genome. We performed an MA experiment with the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and sequenced the genomes of three randomly chosen lines using high-throughput sequencing to estimate the spontaneous mutation rate in this model organism. The mitochondrial mutation rate of 6.76x10(-9), with a Poisson confidence interval of 4.1x10(-9) -9.5x10(-9), per nucleotide per generation is slightly lower than estimates for other taxa. The mutation rate estimate for the nuclear DNA of 2.9x10(-11), with a Poisson confidence interval ranging from 7.4x10(-13) to 1.6x10(-10), is the lowest reported for any eukaryote. These results are consistent with low microsatellite mutation rates previously observed in D. discoideum and low levels of genetic variation observed in wild D. discoideum populations. In addition, D. discoideum has been shown to be quite resistant to DNA damage, which suggests an efficient DNA-repair mechanism that could be an adaptation to life in soil and frequent exposure to intracellular and extracellular mutagenic compounds. The social aspect of the life cycle of D. discoideum and a large portion of the genome under relaxed selection during vegetative growth could also select for a low mutation rate. This hypothesis is supported by a significantly lower mutation rate per cell division in multicellular eukaryotes compared with unicellular eukaryotes.

The latest subfamily called ""GECOs"" were developed with in vitro high-throughput screening, and shown to have novel spectral properties and/or improved fluorescent responses over their ancestor GCaMP3. The most critical parameter in evaluating performance in neurons, however, remains uncharacterized: the relationship between the GECI responses and the number of action potentials (APs). Here we analyzed the GECI responses to APs in cortical pyramidal cells of mouse acute brain slices. Unexpectedly, we found that none of the GECOs exhibited any improved performance over GCaMP3. Our results imply that careful validation is required for the accurate prediction of the actual performance of GECIs in mammalian neurons. We propose that appropriate guidelines for evaluating their efficacy should be established for the benefit of research community, given the rapidly expanding use of GECIs in neuroscience.

The most frequent mutations in this gene, point substitutions in codons 12 and 13, were validated as negative predictors of response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies. Therefore, determining the KRAS mutational status of tumor samples has become an essential tool for managing patients with colorectal cancers. Currently, a variety of detection methods have been established to analyze the mutation status in the key regions of the KRAS gene; however, several challenges remain related to standardized and uniform testing, including the selection of tumor samples, tumor sample processing and optimal testing methods. Moreover, new testing strategies, in combination with the mutation analysis of BRAF, PIK3CA and loss of PTEN proposed by many researchers and pathologists, should be promoted. In addition, we recommend that microsatellite instability, a prognostic factor, be added to the abovementioned concomitant analysis. This review provides an overview of KRAS biology and the recent advances in KRAS mutation testing. This review also addresses other aspects of status testing for determining the appropriate treatment and offers insight into the potential drawbacks of mutational testing. (C) 2012 Baishideng.

Recent developments in bioluminescent imaging (BLI) allow direct in vivo imaging of neurogenesis, and in order to interpret the experimental results, mathematical models are necessary. This study proposes such a mathematical model that describes adult mammalian neurogenesis occurring in the subventricular zone and the subsequent migration of cells through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (OB). This model assumes that a single chemoattractant is responsible for cell migration, secreted both by the OB and in an endocrine fashion by the cells involved in neurogenesis. The solutions to the system of partial differential equations are compared with the physiological rodent process, as previously documented in the literature and quantified through the use of BLI, and a parameter space is described, the corresponding solution to which matches that of the rodent model. A sensitivity analysis shows that this parameter space is stable to perturbation and furthermore that the system as a whole is sloppy. A large number of parameter sets are stochastically generated, and it is found that parameter spaces corresponding to physiologically plausible solutions generally obey constraints similar to the conditions reported in vivo. This further corroborates the model and its underlying assumptions based on the current understanding of the investigated phenomenon. Concomitantly, this leaves room for further quantitative predictions pertinent to the design of future proposed experiments.

We take a Bayesian approach and perform posterior density estimation using an approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo method. Our approach allows us to perform model selection over a selection of potential network growth models. The methodology we apply uses a distance defined in terms of graph spectra which captures the network data more naturally than previously used summary statistics such as the degree distribution. Furthermore, we include the effects of sampling into the analysis, to properly correct for the incompleteness of existing datasets, and have analysed the performance of our method under various degrees of sampling. We consider a number of models focusing not only on the biologically relevant class of duplication models, but also including models of scale-free network growth that have previously been claimed to describe such data. We find a preference for a duplication-divergence with linear preferential attachment model in the majority of the interaction datasets considered. We also illustrate how our method can be used to perform multi-model inference of network parameters to estimate properties of the full network from sampled data.

In biology, a number of fine properties of bistability have been identified. However, these properties are only consequences of bistability at the physiological level, which do not explain why it had to emerge during evolution. Using optimal homeostasis as the first principle, I find that bistability emerges as an indispensable control mechanism. It is the only solution to a dilemma in glucose homeostasis: high insulin efficiency is required to confer rapidness in plasma glucose clearance, whereas an insulin sparing state is required to guarantee the brain's safety during fasting. The optimality consideration renders a clear correspondence between the molecular and physiological levels. This new perspective can illuminate studies on the twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes and the corresponding intervening strategies. For example, overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle may represent sudden environmental changes that cause the lose of optimality, which may contribute to the marked rise of obesity and diabetes in our generation. Because this bistability result is independent of the parameters of the mathematicalmodel (for which the result is quite general), some other biological systems may also use bistability to control homeostasis.

At present no theory satisfactorily explains the origin of the hair cycle rhythm. Based on experimental evidence we propose a prototypic model that focuses on the dynamics of hair matrix keratinocytes. We argue that a plausible feedback-control structure between two key compartments (matrix keratinocytes and dermal papilla) leads to dynamic instabilities in the population dynamics resulting in rhythmic hair growth. The underlying oscillation consists of an autonomous switching between two quasi-steady states. Additional features of the model, namely bistability and excitability, lead to new hypotheses about the impact of interventions on hair growth. We show how in silico testing may facilitate testing of candidate hair growth modulatory agents in human HF organ culture or in clinical trials. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we introduce a novel network-based method to identify highly predictive biomarker candidates for disease. First, we infer two different types of networks: (i) correlation networks, and (ii) a new type of network called ratio networks. Based on these networks, we introduce scores to prioritize features using topological descriptors of the vertices. To evaluate our method we use an example dataset where quantitative targeted MS/MS analysis was applied to a total of 52 blood samples from 22 persons with obesity (BMI > 30) and 30 healthy controls. Using our network-based feature selection approach we identified highly discriminating metabolites for obesity (F-score > 0.85, accuracy > 85%), some of which could be verified by the literature.

If the driving forces of extinction change through time, this assumption may be unrealistic. Testing the consistency of extinction patterns between the past and the present has been difficult, because the phylogenetically explicit methods used to model present-day extinction risk typically cannot be applied to the data from the fossil record. However, the detailed historical and fossil records of the New Zealand avifauna provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct a complete, large faunal assemblage for different periods in the past. Using the first complete phylogeny of all known native New Zealand bird species, both extant and extinct, we show how the taxonomic and phylogenetic selectivity of extinction, and biological correlates of extinction, change from the pre-human period through Polynesian and European occupation, to the present. These changes can be explained both by changes in primary threatening processes, and by the operation of extinction filter effects. The variable patterns of extinction through time may confound attempts to identify risk factors that apply across time periods, and to infer future species declines from past extinction patterns and current threat status.

The relevance of the method is reviewed through the analysis of magnetic tweezers single molecule experiments that revealed unexpected properties of the chromatin fibre.

Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) populations have significantly declined due to overexploitation. As a consequence of their value and population decline, T. thynnus has been the focus of considerable research effort concerning many aspects of their life history. However, in-depth understanding of T. thynnus reproductive biology is still lacking. Knowledge of reproductive physiology is a very important tool for determining effective fisheries and aquaculture management. Transcriptome techniques are proving powerful and provide novel insights into physiological processes. Construction of a microarray from T. thynnus ESTs sourced from reproductive tissues has provided an ideal platform to study the reproductive physiology of bluefin tunas. The aim of this investigation was to compare transcription profiles from the ovaries and testes of mature T. thynnus to establish sex specific variations underlying their reproductive physiology.

Results: Male and females T. thynnus gonad tissues were collected from the wild and histologically staged. Sub-samples of sexually mature tissues were also measured for their mRNA differential expression among the sexes using the custom microarray design BFT 4X44K. A total of 7068 ESTs were assessed for differential expression of which 1273 ESTs were significantly different (p<0.05) with >2 fold change in expression according to sex. Differential expression for 13 of these ESTs was validated with quantitative PCR. These include genes involved in egg envelope formation, hydration, and lipid transport/accumulation more highly expressed in ovaries compared with testis, while genes involved in meiosis, sperm motility and lipid metabolism were more highly expressed in testis compared with ovaries.

Conclusions: This investigation has furthered our knowledge of bluefin tunas reproductive biology by using a contemporary transcriptome approach. Gene expression profiles in T. thynnus sexually mature testes and ovaries were characterized with reference to gametogenesis and potential alternative functions.

We recently reported that both isoforms of TFPI induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of cancer cells. The signaling pathway(s) mediating the effects of TFPI is, however, presently still unclear. Our goal was to further investigate the cellular processes affected by TFPI and to get insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of TFPI, using a global gene expression study approach. TFPI alpha or TFPI beta cDNA were transfected into SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells for stable overexpression. Global mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expressions were measured and functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs according to gene ontology terms was conducted. Selected results were validated using qRT-PCR and Western blot. A total of 242 and 801 mRNA transcripts and 120 and 46 miRNAs were differentially expressed in cells overexpressing TFPI alpha or TFPI beta, respectively. Overexpression of either isoform significantly affected the expression of genes involved in cell development (apoptosis, cell movement, migration, invasion, colony formation, growth, and adhesion) and immune response. Network analyses revealed biological interactions between these genes and implied that several of the genes may be involved in both processes. The expression profiles also correlated significantly with clinical phenotype and outcome. Functional cluster analyses indicated altered activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor, small GTPases, and the NF-kappa B and JAK/STAT cascades when TFPI was overexpressed, and increased activity of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and Elk-1 and phospho-Akt levels was observed. Integrated mRNA-miRNA analyses showed that 19% and 32% of the differentially expressed genes in cells overexpressing TFPI alpha or TFPI beta, respectively, may have been regulated by miRNAs.

Glucocorticoids are potent enhancers of IL-7R alpha expression with diverse roles in T cell biology. Here we identify the transcriptional repressor, growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1), as a novel intermediary in glucocorticoid-induced IL-7R alpha up-regulation. We found Gfi1 to be a major inhibitory target of dexamethasone by microarray expression profiling of 3B4.15 T-hybridoma cells. Concordantly, retroviral transduction of Gfi1 significantly blunted IL-7R alpha up-regulation by dexamethasone. To further assess the role of Gfi1 in vivo, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice, in which a modified Il7r locus expresses GFP to report Il7r gene transcription. By introducing this BAC reporter transgene into either Gfi1-deficient or Gfi1-transgenic mice, we document in vivo that IL-7R alpha transcription is up-regulated in the absence of Gfi1 and down-regulated when Gfi1 is overexpressed. Strikingly, the in vivo regulatory role of Gfi1 was specific for CD8(+), and not CD4(+) T cells or immature thymocytes. These results identify Gfi1 as a specific transcriptional repressor of the Il7r gene in CD8 T lymphocytes in vivo.

However, the frequent requirement of peptide folding in specific interactions of IDPs could impose a kinetic bottleneck, which could be overcome only by efficient folding upon encounter. Intriguingly, existing kinetic data suggest that specific binding of IDPs is generally no slower than that of globular proteins. Here, we exploited the cell cycle regulator p27(KiP1) (p27) as a model system to understand how IDPs might achieve efficient folding upon encounter for facile recognition. Combining experiments and coarse-grained modeling, we demonstrate that long-range electrostatic interactions between enriched charges on p27 and near its binding site on cyclin A not only enhance the encounter rate (i.e., electrostatic steering) but also promote folding-competent topologies in the encounter complexes, allowing rapid subsequent formation of short-range native interactions en route to the specific complex. In contrast, nonspecific hydrophobic interactions, while hardly affecting the encounter rate, can significantly reduce the efficiency of folding upon encounter and lead to slower binding kinetics. Further analysis of charge distributions in a set of known IDP complexes reveals that, although IDP binding sites tend to be more hydrophobic compared to the rest of the target surface, their vicinities are frequently enriched with charges to complement those on IDPs.

Recent research provides unprecedented support for Darwin's claim as well as new reasons to question it, stimulating new theories of human cognitive uniqueness. This article compares and evaluates approaches to such theories. Some prominent theories propose sweeping domain-general characterizations of the difference in cognitive capabilities and/or mechanisms between adult humans and other animals. Dual-process theories for some cognitive domains propose that adult human cognition shares simple basic processes with that of other animals while additionally including slower-developing and more explicit uniquely human processes. These theories are consistent with a modular account of cognition and the 'core knowledge' account of children's cognitive development. A complementary proposal is that human infants have unique social and/or cognitive adaptations for uniquely human learning. A view of human cognitive architecture as a mosaic of unique and species-general modular and domain-general processes together with a focus on uniquely human developmental mechanisms is consistent with modern evolutionary-developmental biology and suggests new questions for comparative research.

","Abstract: Reaction systems are a formal model based on the regulation mechanisms of facilitation and inhibition between biochemical reactions, which underlie the functioning of living cells. The aim of this paper is to explore the expressive power of reaction systems as a modeling framework, showing how their basic assumptions and properties can be exploited to formalize computer science and biology oriented problems. In this view, we first provide a reaction-based description of an iterative algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Then, we show how the regulation of gene expression in the lac operon, involved in the metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coil cells, can be formalized in terms of reaction systems. Finally, we present a method to derive, given a reaction system with n reactions, a functionally equivalent system with n' <= n reactions using simplification methods of boolean expressions.

Several studies have assessed the molecular biology of the virus in this cell type, and a number of differences towards HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells have been described. There is a broad consensus that macrophages resist HIV-1 infection much better than CD4+ T cells. Among other reasons, this is due to the presence of the recently identified host cell restriction factor SamHD1, which is strongly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage. Furthermore, macrophages produce and release relatively low amounts of infectious HIV-1 and are less sensitive to viral cytotoxicity in comparison to CD4+ T cells. Nevertheless, macrophages play a crucial role in the different phases of HIV-1 infection. In this review, we summarize and discuss the significance of macrophages for HIV-1 transmission, the acute and chronic phases of HIV-1 infection, the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated diseases, including neurocognitive disorders. We propose that interaction of HIV-1 with macrophages is crucial during all stages of HIV-1 infection. Thus, long-term successful treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals requires potent strategies to prevent HIV-1 from entering and persisting in these cells.

The tropical and sub-tropical phytoplankton communities exhibited a wide range of responses to climate variability, from radical shifts in the Equatorial Pacific, to changes of only a couple of phytoplankton groups in the North Central Pacific, to no significant changes in the South Pacific. In the Equatorial Pacific, climate variability represented by ENSO dominated the variability of phytoplankton. Here, nitrate, chlorophyll and all of the 4 phytoplankton types (diatoms, cyanobacteria, chlorophytes and coccolithophores) were strongly correlated (p < 0.05) with the Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index (MEI). During La Nina events, diatoms increased and expanded westward along the cold tongue (correlation with MEI, r = -0.87, p < 0.05), while cyanobacteria concentrations decreased significantly (r = 0.69, p < 0.05). El Nino produced the reverse pattern, with cyanobacteria populations increasing while diatoms plummeted. In the North Central Pacific, the MEI was significantly correlated with diatoms (r = -0.40) and chlorophytes (r = -0.43). Ocean biology in the South Pacific was not significantly correlated with MEI. The phytoplankton composition from the assimilation model was compared to that from a new empirical algorithm using satellite data. Despite differences in the absolute concentration, the relative abundance from the model and the satellite-derived approach showed a similar shift in phytoplankton community in the Equatorial Pacific. These results highlight the spatially variable nature of the relationship between phytoplankton community structure and climate variability within the Pacific Ocean.

Low HDL and raised non-HDL cholesterol levels carried increased risk for heart failure development in the Framingham study, independent of any association with myocardial infarction. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) number and function after lipid lowering or HDL raising gene transfer in C57BL/6 low density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDLr-/- 2) mice may be associated with an enhanced relative vascularity in the myocardium and an improved cardiac function.

Methodology/principal findings: Lipid lowering and HDL raising gene transfer were performed using the E1E3E4-deleted LDLr expressing adenoviral vector AdLDLr and the human apolipoprotein A-I expressing vector AdA-I, respectively. AdLDLr transfer in C57BL/6 LDLr-/- mice resulted in a 2.0-fold (p<0.05) increase of the circulating number of EPCs and in an improvement of EPC function as assessed by ex vivo EPC migration and EPC adhesion. Capillary density and relative vascularity in the myocardium were 28% (p<0.01) and 22% (p<0.05) higher, respectively, in AdLDLr mice compared to control mice. The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 12% (p<0.05) and the time constant of isovolumetric relaxation was decreased by 14% (p<0.05) after AdLDLr transfer. Similarly, HDL raising gene transfer increased EPC number and function and raised both capillary density and relative vascularity in the myocardium by 24% (p<0.05). The peak rate of isovolumetric relaxation was increased by 16% (p<0.05) in AdA-I mice compared to control mice.

Conclusions/Significance: Both lipid lowering and HDL raising gene transfer have beneficial effects on EPC biology, relative myocardial vascularity, and diastolic function. These findings raise concerns over the external validity of studies evaluating myocardial biology and cardiac repair in normocholesterolemic animals.

Fluorescence staining, along with gene expression measurements, confirmed that populations of cells collected in different outlets were distinct from one another. Furthermore, primary murine cells processed through the device remained highly viable and could be cultured for 10 days in vitro.

Holocentridae) can accumulate and temporarily sequester copious amounts of zinc (Zn) in their livers. There, it is initially compartmentalized before a subsequent, estrogen-triggered redistribution to the ovaries. Here we show that cellular uptake of Zn is also influenced by estrogen signaling, and that estrogen increases concentrations of the plasma Zn-binding protein vitellogenin (VTG). However, estrogen-mediated increases in VTG are not sufficient to accommodate the magnitude of hepato-ovarian Zn transfer in female squirrelfish (Holocentrus adscensionis). These findings suggest that holocentrids have acquired the ability to use hormonal cues to drive hepatic uptake and storage of Zn, signal for its physiological redistribution, and influence the capacity for systemic transport of Zn beyond the mediation of increased plasma VTG concentrations. Such specific adaptations suggest an advantage for the oocyte, which is corroborated in further studies where we determined that oocyte Zn concentrations are positively correlated with egg viability in captivespawned squirrelfish. The novel nature of these findings underlies the importance of Zn in squirrelfish reproductive biology.

We aimed to identify new targets underlying this pleiotropic effect of lovastatin.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the inhibitory effects of lovastatin on endothelial cell biology and angiogenesis in vitro. Lovastatin at high doses inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, we identified the up-regulation of the actin-binding protein transgelin 2 in endothelial cells following treatment with lovastatin. Changes in transgelin 2 levels were confirmed by Western blot and confocal microscopy. We further demonstrated that the Rho signaling inactivation and actin depolymerization contributed to the up-regulation of transgelin 2. The knockdown of transgelin 2 by siRNA dramatically enhanced endothelial migration and tube formation, and meanwhile attenuated the inhibitory effects of lovastatin on cell motility. Moreover, the lovastatin-induced inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation was also reversed by transgelin 2 knockdown. The activation of Rho GTPase in the absence of transgelin 2 may represent a mechanism underlying the regulation of phosphorylated myosin light chain by transgelin 2.

Conclusions/Significance: These results strongly imply a novel role for transgelin 2 in the angiostatic activities of lovastatin.

Existing genomic analysis tools are often organized around literal views of genomes as linear strings. Even when information is highly condensed, these views grow cumbersome as larger numbers of genomes are added. Data aggregation and summarization methods from the field of visual analytics can provide abstracted comparative views, suitable for sifting large multi-genome datasets to identify critical similarities and differences. We introduce a software system for visual analysis of comparative genomics data. The system automates the process of data integration, and provides the analysis platform to identify and explore features of interest within these large datasets. GenoSets borrows techniques from business intelligence and visual analytics to provide a rich interface of interactive visualizations supported by a multi-dimensional data warehouse. In GenoSets, visual analytic approaches are used to enable querying based on orthology, functional assignment, and taxonomic or user-defined groupings of genomes. GenoSets links this information together with coordinated, interactive visualizations for both detailed and high-level categorical analysis of summarized data. GenoSets has been designed to simplify the exploration of multiple genome datasets and to facilitate reasoning about genomic comparisons. Case examples are included showing the use of this system in the analysis of 12 Brucella genomes. GenoSets software and the case study dataset are freely available at http://genosets.uncc.edu.

It is increasingly evident that different genes contribute to risk for similar syndromes and, conversely, the same genes or even the same alleles cross over traditional diagnostic categories. A current challenge is to understand the cellular biology of identified risk genes. However, most genes associated with complex neuropsychiatric phenotypes are not related through a known biochemical pathway, and many have an entirely unknown cellular function. One possibility is that diverse disease-linked genes converge at a higher-level cellular structure. The synapse is already known to be one such convergence, and emerging evidence suggests the primary cilium as another. Because many genes associated with neuropsychiatric illness are expressed also outside the nervous system, as are cilia, we tested the hypothesis that such genes affect conserved features of the primary cilium. Using RNA interference to test 41 broadly expressed candidate genes associated with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, we found 20 candidates that reduce ciliation in NIH3T3 cells when knocked down, and three whose manipulation increases cilia length. Three of the candidate genes were previously implicated in cilia formation and, altogether, approximately half of the candidates tested produced a ciliary phenotype. Our results support the hypothesis that primary cilia indeed represent a conserved cellular structure at which the effects of diverse neuropsychiatric risk genes converge. More broadly, they suggest a relatively simple cell-based approach that may be useful for exploring the complex biological underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disease.

It is known that the nuclear NF-kappa B oscillates and different oscillation patterns lead to different gene expression. Nearly forty reports on modeling and simulation of nuclear NF-kappa B have been published to date. The computational models reported so far are temporal or two-dimensional, and the discussions on spatial parameters have not been involved or limited. Since spatial parameters in cancer cells such as nuclear to cytoplasmic volume (N/C) ratio are different from normal cells, it is important to understand the relationship between oscillation patterns and spatial parameters. Here we report simulations of a 3D computational model for the oscillation of nuclear NF-kappa B using A-Cell software. First, we found that the default biochemical kinetic constants used in the temporal model cannot replicate the experimentally observed oscillation in the 3D model. Thus, the default parameters should be changed in the 3D model. Second, spatial parameters such as N/C ratio, nuclear transport, diffusion coefficients, and the location of I kappa B synthesis were found to alter the oscillation pattern. Third, among them, larger N/C ratios resulted in persistent oscillation of nuclear NF-kappa B, and larger nuclear transport resulted in faster oscillation frequency. Our simulation results suggest that the changes in spatial parameters seen in cancer cells is one possible mechanism for alteration in the oscillation pattern of nuclear NF-kappa B and lead to the altered gene expression in these cells.

For studies by high resolution analytical methods, these integral membrane receptors have to be expressed in large quantities, solubilized from cell membranes and purified in detergent micelles, which may result in a severe destabilization and a loss of function. Here, we report insights into differential effects of detergents, lipids and cannabinoid ligands on stability of the recombinant cannabinoid receptor CB2, and provide guidelines for preparation and handling of the fully functional receptor suitable for a wide array of downstream applications. While we previously described the expression in Escherichia coli, purification and liposome-reconstitution of multi-milligram quantities of CB2, here we report an efficient stabilization of the recombinant receptor in micelles - crucial for functional and structural characterization. The effects of detergents, lipids and specific ligands on structural stability of CB2 were assessed by studying activation of G proteins by the purified receptor reconstituted into liposomes. Functional structure of the ligand binding pocket of the receptor was confirmed by binding of H-2-labeled ligand measured by solid-state NMR. We demonstrate that a concerted action of an anionic cholesterol derivative, cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) and high affinity cannabinoid ligands CP-55,940 or SR-144,528 are required for efficient stabilization of the functional fold of CB2 in dodecyl maltoside (DDM)/CHAPS detergent solutions. Similar to CHS, the negatively charged phospholipids with the serine headgroup (PS) exerted significant stabilizing effects in micelles while uncharged phospholipids were not effective. The purified CB2 reconstituted into lipid bilayers retained functionality for up to several weeks enabling high resolution structural studies of this GPCR at physiologically relevant conditions.

The development and function of its auditory brainstem circuitry is exceptionally well studied. These circuits represent an excellent system for genetic manipulation to investigate mechanisms controlling neural circuit formation, synaptogenesis, neuronal polarity, and dendritic arborization. The present study investigates the auditory nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM). The neurotrophin receptor TrkB regulates dendritic structure in CNS neurons. TrkB is expressed in NM neurons at E7-E8 when these neurons have dendritic arbors. Downregulation of TrkB occurs after E8 followed by retraction of dendrites and by E18 most NM cells are adendritic. Is cessation of TrkB expression in NM necessary for dendritic retraction? To answer this question we combined focal in ovo electroporation with transposon mediated gene transfer to obtain stable expression of Doxycycline (Dox) regulated transgenes, specifically TrkB coexpressed with EGFP in a temporally controlled manner. Electroporation was performed at E2 and Dox added onto the chorioallointoic membrane from E7.5 to E16. Expression of EGFP had no effect on development of the embryo, or cell morphology and organization of auditory brainstem nuclei. NM cells expressing EGFP and TrkB at E17-E18 had dendrites and biophysical properties uncharacteristic for normal NM cells, indicating that cessation of TrkB expression is essential for dendrite retraction and functional maturation of these neurons. These studies indicate that expression of transposon based plasmids is an effective method to genetically manipulate events in mid to late embryonic brain development in chick.

Although ultrasensitive detection and analytical technology at the single molecule level is becoming routine, protein extraction techniques have not followed suit and still call for complete lysis that leads to cell death. In principle, with refined extraction techniques, intracellular proteins can potentially be extracted without killing the cell. In this Letter, we demonstrate that electroporation is capable of releasing intracellular proteins from adherent Chinese hamster ovary cells while preserving the cell viability. By tuning the duration and intensity of an electric pulse, we were able to control the average amount of protein release and the percentage of viable cells after the operation. Our results indicate that a substantial fraction of the cell population was able to release proteins under electroporation and survive the procedure. Interestingly, at the single cell level, the probability for cell death does not increase with more protein release.

Here, we apply an experimental approach to the subject. By using microbial-based microcosm-experiments, invasion-biology can be placed on firmer experimental, and hence, less anecdotal ground. A better understanding of the mechanisms that govern invasion-success of bacteria in soil communities will provide knowledge on the factors that hinder successful establishment of bacteria artificially inoculated into soil, e. g. for remediation purposes. Further, it will yield valuable information on general principles of invasion biology in other domains of life.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we studied invasion and establishment success of GFP-tagged Pseudomonas fluorescens DSM 50090 in laboratory microcosms during a 42-day period. We used soil heating to create a disturbance gradient, and hypothesized that increased disturbance would facilitate invasion; our experiments confirmed this hypothesis. We suggest that the key factors associated with the heating disturbance that explain the enhanced invasion success are increased carbon substrate availability and reduced diversity, and thus, competition-and predation-release. In a second experiment we therefore separated the effects of increased carbon availability and decreased diversity. Here, we demonstrated that the effect of the indigenous soil community on bacterial invasion was stronger than that of resource availability. In particular, introduced bacteria established better in a long term perspective at lower diversity and predation pressure.

Conclusion: We propose increased use of microbial systems, for experimental study of invasion scenarios. They offer a simple and cost-efficient way to study and understand biological invasion. Consequently such systems can help us to better predict the mechanisms controlling changes in stability of communities and ecosystems. This is becoming increasingly relevant since anthropogenic disturbance causes increasing global change, which promotes invasion. Moreover, a thorough understanding of factors controlling invasion and establishment of artificially amended microorganisms will mean a major step forward for soil-remediation microbiology.

This phenomenon, called ""length bias"", will influence subsequent analyses such as Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. In the presence of length bias, Gene Ontology categories that include longer genes are more likely to be identified as enriched. These categories, however, are not necessarily biologically more relevant. We show that one can effectively adjust for length bias in Gene Ontology analysis by including transcript length as a covariate in a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model makes the statistical issue underlying length bias more transparent: transcript length becomes a confounding factor when it correlates with both the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of the differential expression test. The inclusion of the transcript length as a covariate allows one to investigate the direct correlation between the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of testing differential expression, conditional on the transcript length. We present both real and simulated data examples to show that the logistic regression approach is simple, effective, and flexible.

Hydrophilic regions were prepared on hydrophobic PDMS plates by trapping and melting functional polymer particles and performing subsequent reactions with partially oxidized dextran. Small aliquots of a gelation solution were selectively trapped on the hydrophilic areas by a simple dipping process that was utilized to make thin hydrogel patterns by the in situ gelation of a sol solution. Using this process, we successfully formed calcium alginate, collagen I, and chitosan hydrogels with a thickness of several micrometers and shapes that followed the hydrophilized regions.

They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N-2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N-2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two ""end points"" represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related.

Here, we report a class of propynoic acid carbamoyl methyl amides (PACMAs) that are active against a panel of human ovarian cancer cell lines. Using fluorescent derivatives, 2D gel electrophoresis, and MS, we established that PACMA 31, one of the most active analogs, acts as an irreversible small-molecule inhibitor of PDI, forming a covalent bond with the active site cysteines of PDI. We also showed that PDI activity is essential for the survival and proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, PACMA 31 showed tumor targeting ability and significantly suppressed ovarian tumor growth without causing toxicity to normal tissues.

As in the philosophy of science in general, and in the philosophies of particular sciences, critical issues in the philosophy and sociology of astrobiology are both stimulated and illuminated by history. Among those issues are (1) epistemological issues such as the status of astrobiology as a science, the problematic nature of evidence and inference, and the limits of science; (2) metaphysical/scientific issues, including the question of defining the fundamental concepts of life, mind, intelligence, and culture in a universal context; the role of contingency and necessity in the origin of these fundamental phenomena; and whether or not the universe is in some sense fine-tuned for life and perhaps biocentric; (3) societal issues such as the theological, ethical, and worldview impacts of the discovery of microbial or intelligent life; and the question of whether the search for extraterrestrial life should be pursued at all, and with what precautions; and (4) issues related to the sociology of scientific knowledge, including the diverse attitudes and assumptions of different scientific communities and different cultures to the problem of life beyond Earth, the public ""will to believe,"" and the formation of the discipline of astrobiology.

Migratory birds may be especially vulnerable because of the wide range of geographic areas that they depend on throughout the annual cycle. We examined the potential effects of non-breeding season climate change on the breeding biology of Kirtland's Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii, formerly Dendroica kirtlandii), an endangered songbird that breeds in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan and winters in the Bahamas. Our objectives were to determine whether spring arrival dates on the breeding grounds correlate with late winter rainfall in non-breeding areas and whether this has consequences for reproductive success. We used data on spring arrival dates and number of fledglings per year, sampling many individuals across multiple years, to show that males arrive on breeding grounds later following drier winters. There was a strong male age * rainfall interaction, which indicates that first-time breeders were much more sensitive to changes in rainfall than experienced adults. Regardless of age, however, drier winters and delayed arrival and nest initiation were significantly associated with fewer offspring fledged. These results are important because the Caribbean region is currently experiencing a significant drying trend, and climate change models predict that the severity of this drought will continue to increase. Any resulting adjustments to the timing of migration could constrain spring arrival dates and limit reproductive success for the endangered Kirtland's Warbler, as well as other Neotropical migrants wintering in the Caribbean.

Cellular microenvironmental cues play critical roles in regulating ESC functions, but it is challenging to control them with synthetic components.

Mouse ESC (mESC) were cultured on electrospun nanofibers made from polymethylglutarimide (PMGI), which is a synthetic thermoplastic polymer stable under culture conditions. Both topology and the density of PMGI nanofibers were key factors. mESCs on nanofibers had a growth rate comparable to those cultured conventionally and retained their pluripotency. Furthermore, self-renewed ESCs differentiated into all three germ layers thereby providing a reliable way to expand mESCs without feeder cells.

This review intends to illustrate these perspectives through examples corresponding to different strategies of molecular-targeted therapies: use of a monoclonal antibody binding a receptor (rituximab and rheumatoid arthritis) or a ligand (bevacizumab and age-related macular degeneration), tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib and systemic sclerosis) or inhibitor of cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways (immunosuppressive and antiproliferative effects of mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitors).

In 2004, World Health Organization classification united under this name all the carcinomas with sarcomatous or sarcomatous-like component with spindle cell or giant cell appearance. There are five subtypes: spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, pleomorphic carcinoma, carcino-sarcoma and pulmonary blastoma. Clinical characteristics are not specific from the others subtypes of NSCLC. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition pathway may play a key role. Patients are frequently symptomatic. Tumors are voluminous more often peripherical than central, with strong fixation on FDG TEP CT. Distant metastasis are frequent with atypical locations such as peritoneal or retroperitoneal sites. These tumors have poorer prognosis than the other NSCLC subtypes because of great aggressivity, and frequent chemoresistance. Here, we present a review of litterature in order to better describe these tumors.

In most families, it is caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene and is characterized by early onset of multiple specific cancers and very high lifetime cumulative cancer risk. Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular biology of TP53, the optimal clinical management of this syndrome is poorly defined.

These companies can determine the local persistence of many species and have considerable implications for global conservation outcomes. Many companies are willing to invest in improved management as long as this does not undermine their businessindeed accessing green markets often makes commercial sense. Compliance with common standards of good commercial practice requires identification of all species of conservation significance which occur within their areas of management responsibility. But, as we demonstrate, it is impossible for companies to do this comprehensively. Such demands are often counterproductive in that they alienate those who might otherwise be willing to improve. Given the finite resources available for achieving conservation outcomes, we need to trade off data collection against other costs. To encourage adoption and implementation of conservation friendly practices requires incentives, not technical and financial obstacles. We challenge conservation biologists to reconsider the realities of good forest management, and provide pragmatic guidance for business compatible conservation. Until we engage more effectively with commercial interests, opportunities for improved conservation outcomes will be wasted.

The results show that whereas most respondents are willing to share article-related biodiversity data, more than 60% of respondents are unwilling to share primary data before publishing. Results indicate an underdeveloped culture of data sharing and several major technological and operational barriers. A major concern for researchers is appropriate benefits from data sharing. Most respondents would accept data archiving policies of journals. Researchers also express concerns about how to easily and efficiently deal with data and data quality in public databases.

It is proving to be a huge challenge for computational biologists to use as much information as possible from experimental data to provide annotations for genome data of unknown function. A central component to this process is to use experimentally determined structures, which provide a means to detect homology that is not discernable from just the sequence and permit the consequences of genomic variation to be realized at the molecular level. In particular, structures also form the basis of many bioinformatics methods for improving the detailed functional annotations of enzymes in combination with similarities in sequence and chemistry.

The distinct metabolic phenotype of cancers provides an interesting avenue for treatment, potentially with minimal side effects. As many cancers show similar metabolic characteristics, drugs targeting the cancer metabolic phenotype are, perhaps optimistically, expected to be 'magic bullet' treatments. Over the last few years there have been a number of potential drugs developed to specifically target cancer metabolism. Several of these drugs are currently in clinical and preclinical trials.

Although mortality rates are typically <0.1% and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza strain has been well contained by vaccination and strict hygiene, particularly virulent pandemic forms have emerged three times in the last century, resulting in millions of deaths. Current vaccine and therapeutic strategies are limited by the ability of the virus to generate variants that evade vaccine-induced immune responses and resist the therapeutic effects of antiviral drugs. Host genetic variations affect immune responses and may induce adverse effects during drug treatment or against vaccines. To develop new, first-in-class therapeutics, new antiviral targets and new chemical entities must be identified in the context of the immunogenomic repertoire of the patient.

In this study, we constructed an Ad5-Eag1-shRNA vector and evaluated its efficiency for Eag1 knockdown and its effects on osteosarcoma. Our results showed that Ad5-Eag1-shRNA had high interference efficiency of Eag1 expression and suppressed osteosarcoma growth both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying tumor growth inhibition induced by Eag1 silencing, the intratumoral microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 staining and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was detected by Western blot analysis. We found that Eag1 silencing led to decreased angiogenesis and VEGF expression in the xenograft model of osteosarcoma. Finally, we detected a time-dependent decrease in VEGF expression and considerably reduced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) activation in osteosarcoma cells treated by Eag1 shRNA.

However, due to the complexity of Chinese herbs, a full understanding of TCM's action mechanisms is still unavailable despite plenty of successful applications of TCM in the treatment of various diseases, including especially cardiovascular diseases (CVD), one of the leading causes of death. Thus in the present work, by incorporating the chemical predictors, target predictors and network construction approaches, an integrated system of TCM has been constructed to systematically uncover the underlying action mechanisms of TCM. From three representative Chinese herbs, i.e., Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen and Corydalis yanhusuo WT Wang which have been widely used in CVD treatment, by combinational use of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) screening and network pharmacology techniques, we have generated 64 bioactive ingredients and identified 54 protein targets closely associated with CVD, of which 29 are common targets (52.7%) of the three herbs. The result provides new information on the efficiency of the Chinese herbs for the treatment of CVD and also explains one of the basic theories of TCM, i.e., ""multiple herbal drugs can treat one disease"". The predicted potential targets were then mapped to target-disease and target-signal pathway connections, which revealed the relationships of the active ingredients with their potential targets, diseases and signal systems. This means that for the first time, the action mechanism of these three important Chinese herbs for the treatment of CVD is uncovered, by generating and identifying both their active ingredients and novel targets specifically related to CVD, which clarifies some of the common conceptions in TCM, and thus provides clues to modernize such specific herbal medicines.

One particular example of this concerns the etiologic agent Mycobacterium lepraemurium (MLM). MLM is a fastidious microorganism that is difficult to grow in axenic media; in a way, this has hampered attempts to thoroughly study its physiological and metabolic characteristics. MLM is an obligate intracellular bacillus that invades macrophages and replicates profusely with a generation time that oscillates between 0.5 and 11 days. In the present study, we have successfully maintained MLM alive for more than 12 days in vitro, providing us with an opportunity to study its susceptibility to several anti-leprosy agents and other drugs. To achieve this, we used a fluorescence reduction assay of alamar blue (a resazurin) in a microplate format (microplate-alamar-blue-assay; MABA), which is a highly sensitive, practical, and inexpensive method for assaying cell viability. We found that MLM was highly susceptible to clofazimine and rifampicin and was less susceptible to streptomycin, thiacetazone, kanamycin, dapsone, and ethionamide, in that order. MLM was not susceptible to four plant triterpenoids (oleanolic acid, neolignan-c, sitosterol, and ursolic acid) for which bactericidal activity has been reported in M. tuberculosis. Because the MABA has high sensitivity, it can be used to monitor the activity of microorganisms that are difficult to cultivate (such as M. lepraemurium), in response to various drugs, thus offering a method to complement the study of murine leprosy, about which many questions remain unanswered.

Rhizosphere soil layers from 01, 12, 23, 34, 46, and 68?mm distance to separated roots were investigated in an incubation experiment (42 d, 15 degrees C) for changes in total C and N and that derived from rhizodeposition in total soil, in soil microbial biomass, and in the 0.05 M K2SO4extractable soil fraction. CO2-C respiration in total and that derived from rhizodeposition were measured from the incubated rhizosphere soil samples. Rhizodeposition C was detected in rhizosphere soil up to 46?mm distance from the separated roots. Rhizodeposition N was only detected in the rhizosphere soils up to 34?mm distance from the roots. Microbial biomass C and N was increased with increasing proximity to the separated roots. Beside 13C and 15N derived from rhizodeposits, unlabeled soil C and N (native SOM) were incorporated into the growing microbial biomass towards the roots, indicating a distinct acceleration of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and N immobilization into the growing microbial biomass, even under the competition of plant growth. During the soil incubation, microbial biomass C and N decreased in all samples. Any decrease in microbial biomass C and N in the incubated rhizosphere soil layers is attributed mainly to a decrease of unlabeled (native) C and N, whereas the main portion of previously incorporated rhizodeposition C and N during the plant growth period remained immobilized in the microbial biomass during the incubation. Mineralization of native SOM C and N was enhanced within the entire investigated rhizosphere gradient. The results indicate complex interactions between substrate input derived from rhizodeposition, microbial growth, and accelerated C and N turnover, including the decomposition of native SOM (i.e., rhizosphere priming effects) at a high spatial resolution from the roots.

Methods: PDL stromal cells were obtained from extracted premolars by using the outgrowth method. Cell morphological features, self-replication capability, and the presence of cell-surface markers, along with osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation, were confirmed. In addition, myogenic differentiation was induced by the use of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) for DNA demethylation. Results: PDL stromal cells showed growth patterns and morphological features similar to those of fibroblasts. In contrast, the proliferation rates of premolar PDL stromal cells were similar to those of bone marrow and adipogenic stern cells. PDL stromal cells expressed surface markers of human mesenchymal stem cells (i.e., CD90 and CD105), but not those of hematopoietic stem cells (i.e., CD31 and CD34). PDL stromal cells were differentiated into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Myotube structures were induced in PDL stromal cells after 5-Aza pretreatment, but not in the absence of 5-Aza pretreatment. Conclusions: PDL stromal cells isolated from extracted premolars can potentially be a good source of postnatal stem cells for oromaxillofacial regeneration in bone and muscle.

Dramatic improvements in genomic research will require accurate sequencing of long (> 10,000 base-pairs), intact DNA molecules. Our approach directly visualizes the sequence of DNA molecules using electron microscopy. This report represents the first identification of DNA base pairs within intact DNA molecules by electron microscopy. By enzymatically incorporating modified bases, which contain atoms of increased atomic number, direct visualization and identification of individually labeled bases within a synthetic 3,272 base-pair DNA molecule and a 7,249 base-pair viral genome have been accomplished. This proof of principle is made possible by the use of a dUTP nucleotide, substituted with a single mercury atom attached to the nitrogenous base. One of these contrast-enhanced, heavy-atom-labeled bases is paired with each adenosine base in the template molecule and then built into a double-stranded DNA molecule by a template-directed DNA polymerase enzyme. This modification is small enough to allow very long molecules with labels at each A-U position.

Emerging applications of synthetic biology have begun to exploit such switches to achieve increasingly sophisticated designed behaviors. However, not all switch architectures allow facile design of the switching and memory properties. Furthermore, not all designs are built from components for which large families of variants exist, a requirement for building many orthogonal switch variants. Therefore, there is a critical need from genetic engineers for scalable strategies that yield custom bistable switches. Here, we use a sigma factor and its cognate anti-sigma factor to experimentally verify that ultrasensitivity from sequestration combined with positive feedback is sufficient to build a bistable switch. We show that sequestration allows us to predictably tune the switching boundaries, and we can easily tune our switch to function as a set-reset latch that can be toggled between two states by a pulse of inducer input.

Previous evidence suggested substantial divergence of regulatory networks across species. However, systematically assessing the extent of this plasticity and its functional implications has been challenging due to limited experimental data and the noisy nature of computational predictions. Here, we introduce a novel approach to study cis-regulatory evolution, and use it to trace the regulatory history of 88 DNA motifs of transcription factors across 23 Ascomycota fungi. While motifs are conserved, we find a pervasive gain and loss in the regulation of their target genes. Despite this turnover, the biological processes associated with a motif are generally conserved. We explain these trends using a model with a strong selection to conserve the overall function of a transcription factor, and a much weaker selection over the specific genes it targets. The model also accounts for the turnover of bound targets measured experimentally across species in yeasts and mammals. Thus, selective pressures on regulatory networks mostly tolerate local rewiring, and may allow for subtle fine-tuning of gene regulation during evolution.

The detailed knowledge of the signaling pathways determining vulval precursor cell (VPC) fates permitted us to create a computational model based on the antagonistic interactions between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/RAS/MAPK and the NOTCH pathways that specify the primary and secondary fates, respectively. A key notion of our model is called bounded asynchrony, which predicts that a limited degree of asynchrony in the progression of the VPCs is necessary to break their equivalence. While searching for a molecular mechanism underlying bounded asynchrony, we discovered that the termination of NOTCH signaling is tightly linked to cell-cycle progression. When single VPCs were arrested in the G1 phase, intracellular NOTCH failed to be degraded, resulting in a mixed primary/secondary cell fate. Moreover, the G1 cyclins CYD-1 and CYE-1 stabilize NOTCH, while the G2 cyclin CYB-3 promotes NOTCH degradation. Our findings reveal a synchronization mechanism that coordinates NOTCH signaling with cell-cycle progression and thus permits the formation of a stable cell fate pattern.

It represents a unique strategy of antibiotic tolerance and it can complicate design of effective antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we have analyzed responses of a lab strain of Escherichia coli to antibiotics that target the ribosome. We show that the IE can be explained by bistable inhibition of bacterial growth. A critical requirement for this bistability is sufficiently fast degradation of ribosomes, which can result from antibiotic-induced heat-shock response. Furthermore, antibiotics that elicit the IE can lead to 'band-pass' response of bacterial growth to periodic antibiotic treatment: the treatment efficacy drastically diminishes at intermediate frequencies of treatment. Our proposed mechanism for the IE may be generally applicable to other bacterial species treated with antibiotics targeting the ribosomes.

Analog-sensitive alleles of protein kinases are powerful chemical genetic tools for rapid and specific interrogation of kinase function. Moreover, combining these tools with advanced proteomics and substrate labeling has identified phosphorylation sites on numerous protein targets.

These two highly-sensitive surface scanning probe techniques go far beyond nano-imaging, by enabling researchers to localize and manipulate individual molecules on cell surfaces with nanoscale spatial resolution. Specifically, nanophotonic approaches and dynamic measurements in ultra-confined volumes allow nowadays the visualization of dynamic processes on cell membranes with optical spatial resolution down to 30 nm and sub-millisecond time resolution. These NSOM approaches are now exploited to reveal the existence of pre-assembled nanoplatforms of multi-molecular components on mammalian cells, to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the well-defined architecture of the cell surface and to decipher the molecular bases of diverse cellular processes, ranging from cell adhesion to pathogen recognition. In parallel, remarkable progress in AFM techniques now provides new opportunities for localizing single molecules in living cells and for analyzing their adhesive and mechanical properties in relation to function.

However, it is a non-trivial task to understand how a change at the protein structure level eventually affects a cell's behavior. This is because complex information at both the protein and pathway level has to be integrated. Given that the idea of integrating both protein and pathway dynamics to estimate the systemic impact of missense mutations in proteins remains predominantly unexplored, we investigate the practicality of such an approach by formulating mathematical models and comparing them with experimental data to study missense mutations. We present two case studies: (1) interpreting systemic perturbation for mutations within the cell cycle control mechanisms (G2 to mitosis transition) for yeast; (2) phenotypic classification of neuron-related human diseases associated with mutations within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We show that the application of simplified mathematical models is feasible for understanding the effects of small sequence changes on cellular behavior.

Consistent with modular activity in metabolism, we found that most of the metabolites experimentally detected in each module simultaneously increased their relative abundances during nitrogen fixation. In this work, we explore the relationships among topology, biological function, and optimal activity in the metabolism of R. etli through an integrative analysis based on modeling and metabolome data. Our findings suggest that the metabolic activity during nitrogen fixation is supported by interacting structural modules that correlate with three functional classifications: nucleic acids, peptides, and lipids. More fundamentally, we supply evidence that such modular organization during functional nitrogen fixation is a robust property under different environmental conditions.

These methods have been used to study 40 publicly available HapMap samples of European (CEU) and African (YRI) ancestry to demonstrate a sequencing error rate, <5.63X10(-4), nucleotide diversity of 1.6x10(-3) for CEU and 3.7x10(-3) for YRI, patterns of sequence variation consistent with earlier studies, but a higher rate of heteroplasmy varying between 10% and 50%. These results demonstrate that next-generation sequencing technologies allow interrogation of the mitochondrial genome in greater depth than previously possible which may be of value in biology and medicine.

A strong relevance of this metabolic individuality for biomedical and pharmaceutical research has been reported. However, a considerable amount of the molecules currently quantified by modern metabolomics techniques are chemically unidentified. The identification of these ""unknown metabolites"" is still a demanding and intricate task, limiting their usability as functional markers of metabolic processes. As a consequence, previous GWAS largely ignored unknown metabolites as metabolic traits for the analysis. Here we present a systems-level approach that combines genome-wide association analysis and Gaussian graphical modeling with metabolomics to predict the identity of the unknown metabolites. We apply our method to original data of 517 metabolic traits, of which 225 are unknowns, and genotyping information on 655,658 genetic variants, measured in 1,768 human blood samples. We report previously undescribed genotype-metabotype associations for six distinct gene loci (SLC22A2, COMT, CYP3A5, CYP2C18, GBA3, UGT3A1) and one locus not related to any known gene (rs12413935). Overlaying the inferred genetic associations, metabolic networks, and knowledge-based pathway information, we derive testable hypotheses on the biochemical identities of 106 unknown metabolites. As a proof of principle, we experimentally confirm nine concrete predictions. We demonstrate the benefit of our method for the functional interpretation of previous metabolomics biomarker studies on liver detoxification, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Our approach is generic in nature and can be directly transferred to metabolomics data from different experimental platforms.

In this study we have used a combination of live imaging, single cell lineage analyses, and perturbation of specific signaling pathways to dissect the specification of the adaxial cells of the zebrafish embryo. We show that the adaxial cells are myogenic precursors that form a cell fate equivalence group of approximately 20 cells that consequently give rise to two distinct sub-types of muscle fibers: the superficial slow muscle fibers (SSFs) and muscle pioneer cells (MPs), distinguished by specific gene expression and cell behaviors. Using a combination of live imaging, retrospective and indicative fate mapping, and genetic studies, we show that MP and SSF precursors segregate at the beginning of segmentation and that they arise from distinct regions along the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes of the adaxial cell compartment. FGF signaling restricts MP cell fate in the anterior-most adaxial cells in each somite, while BMP signaling restricts this fate to the middle of the DV axis. Thus our results reveal that the synergistic actions of HH, FGF, and BMP signaling independently create a three-dimensional (3D) signaling milieu that coordinates cell fate within the adaxial cell equivalence group.

Due to their great public health importance it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanism(s) of cold adaptation and temperature sensitivity that are currently unknown. For instance, secondary RNA structures play important roles in influenza biology. Thus, we hypothesized that a relatively minor change in temperature (32-39 degrees C) can lead to perturbations in influenza RNA structures and, that these structural perturbations may be different for mRNAs of the wild type (wt) and ca/ts strains. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel in silico method that enables assessing whether two related RNA molecules would undergo (dis)similar structural perturbations upon temperature change. The proposed method allows identifying those areas within an RNA chain where dissimilarities of RNA secondary structures at two different temperatures are particularly pronounced, without knowing particular RNA shapes at either temperature. We identified such areas in the NS2, PA, PB2 and NP mRNAs. However, these areas are not identical for the wt and ca/ts mutants. Differences in temperature-induced structural changes of wt and ca/ts mRNA structures may constitute a yet unappreciated molecular mechanism of the cold adaptation/temperature sensitivity phenomena.

Activated platelets release many proteins favoring wound healing and promoting angiogenesis. Microparticles (MP) are small plasma membrane vesicles shed from cells upon their activation or apoptosis. Platelet-derived microparticles (PMP) constitute the majority of the pool of MP circulating in the blood. PMP express and may transfer functional receptors, stimulate the release of cytokines, activate intracellular signaling pathways, promote angiogenesis, and are involved in tissue regeneration and cancer metastasis.

Results: Amiloride was shown to block cortical spreading depression, the experimental correlate of aura, and inhibited trigeminal activation in in vivo migraine models, via an acid-sensing ion channel 1 mechanism. Remarkably, amiloride then demonstrated good clinical efficacy in a small open-labeled pilot study of patients, reducing aura and headache symptoms in 4 of 7 patients with otherwise intractable aura.

Little is known about the dynamics of pseudomonads population in extensive agricultural systems under the influence of biotic and abiotic factors. As part of the national consortium BIOSPAS devoted to study soil biology and its relationship with productivity, our lab began to characterize pseudomonad populations in agricultural soils under no-till management. We here report the set up and application of a combination of selective plating and PCR-RFLP analysis of the genus specific gacA and oprF genes, to quantify and study the community structure of culturable pseudomonads in bulk soil and rhizosphere samples. The specificity of both methods has been verified by 16S rDNA and oprF sequencing. The application of selective plating and gacA/oprF PCR-RFLP analyses revealed differences in the amount and predominant type of culturable pseudomonads among geographical locations, among treatments, and between rhizospheric and bulk soil.

Improvements in survival and quality of life have led to a new situation where patients with rare respiratory diseases want to plan their reproductive lives. The intention of this review is to present the experience accumulated in the field of the reproductive health of these women.

In several rare respiratory diseases, a genetic base has been identified. The combination of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, assisted reproduction and molecular biology techniques enable embryos to be studied genetically before being transplanted into the uterus. Therefore, the risk for transmitting a certain disease or chromosome alteration may be avoided in high-risk couples, and prenatal diagnoses may be done by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.

As a general rule, contraceptive methods should be personalized by evaluating the general state of female patients as well as their possibilities for pregnancy, complications and the future possibility of lung transplantation.

In lymphangioleiomyomatosis and primary pulmonary hypertension, pregnancy is considered a contraindication. In the former, there is a very high risk for pneumothorax and loss of lung function. In the latter, mortality reaches 33%. In cystic fibrosis, it is estimated that each year 4% of patients become pregnant and there is no observed loss in lung function.

There are special circumstances in childbirth that should be considered as well as specific anesthesia risks.

Recent discoveries, including the activity of retrotransposons, the extent of copy number variations, somatic and chromosomal mosaicism, and the nature of the epigenome as a regulator of DNA expressivity, are challenging a series of dogmas concerning the nature of the genome and the relationship between genotype and phenotype. According to three widely held dogmas, DNA is the unchanging template of heredity, is identical in all the cells and tissues of the body, and is the sole agent of inheritance. Rather than being an unchanging template, DNA appears subject to a good deal of environmentally induced change. Instead of identical DNA in all the cells of the body, somatic mosaicism appears to be the normal human condition. And DNA can no longer be considered the sole agent of inheritance. We now know that the epigenome, which regulates gene expressivity, can be inherited via the germline. These developments are particularly significant for behavior genetics for at least three reasons: First, epigenetic regulation, DNA variability, and somatic mosaicism appear to be particularly prevalent in the human brain and probably are involved in much of human behavior; second, they have important implications for the validity of heritability and gene association studies, the methodologies that largely define the discipline of behavior genetics; and third, they appear to play a critical role in development during the perinatal period and, in particular, in enabling phenotypic plasticity in offspring. I examine one of the central claims to emerge from the use of heritability studies in the behavioral sciences, the principle of minimal shared maternal effects, in light of the growing awareness that the maternal perinatal environment is a critical venue for the exercise of adaptive phenotypic plasticity.

Postlarval and juvenile gag were collected from late spring to early fall of 2007 and 2008 using a variety of gear types; otoliths from postlarvae collected in previous years were also examined.

The distributions of PLDs were similar among sampling months suggesting no effect of PLD on subsequent survival. Although there was no relationship between PLD and date of ingress, PLD was shorter for fish with later fertilization dates. Juvenile growth rates derived from length and estimated ages were approximately 1.4 mm d(-1) during summer months and did not differ between years.

Individuation of vascular spread biomarkers is actually focused on the study of factors involved both in hemostasis and angiogenesis. Interestingly the microenvironment of sarcomas showed the very same mesenchymal origin of the surrounding stromal cells. The presence of circulating tumor cells and miRNAs in blood samples of sarcoma patients represents the possibility not only to better stratify patients group according to the prognosis but also to tailor new individualized therapy. So, it could be predicted that some genes expressed in a specific sarcoma might have prognostic significance or therapeutic targeting potential and molecular targets can be identified in the tumor or in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore the initial evaluation of a sarcoma patient should include in-depth genetic evaluation including karyotyping and c-DNA/protein expression profiling. The chemokine signaling demonstrated to be deeply implicated in sarcoma development as well as to have a significant role in development of metastatic disease, especially in directing tumor cells towards the preferential sites of metastases in sarcoma, lung and bone. It is unsolved if the blood stream is a more favorable environment compared to lymphatic or if lymph nodes are more efficient in destroying metastatic sarcoma cells. But the comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms of the behavior of mesenchymal malignant tumors is at its dawn.

Spectrum theory is most consistent with the progression of melanoma from the primary site to the in-transit locations, regional or sentinel lymph nodes and beyond to the distant sites. Therefore, early diagnosis and surgical treatment before its spread is the most effective treatment. Recently, new approaches have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma. Genomic profiling and sequencing will form the basis for molecular taxonomy for more accurate subgrouping of melanoma patients in the future. New insights of molecular mechanisms of metastasis are summarized in this review article. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become a standard of care for staging primary melanoma without the need for a more morbid complete regional lymph node dissection. With recent developments in molecular biology and genomics, novel molecular targeted therapy is being developed through clinical trials. ", Oncology 10.1007/s10585-012-9517-x,Meeting the biologic challenge of colorectal metastases,"Abstract: An overview of colorectal cancer discussed (Philip Paty) the good outcome after primary management with local control in 90-95 % of colon and 85 % in rectal cancer patients with major progression to metastases and to death related to hematogenous dissemination. The major disease pathways include the APC, aneuploid pathway involving mutations of P53, KRAS, SMAD 4, or the CMP/MSI pathway, mismatched repair defect as characterized by Lynch syndrome, the major hereditary form which may also have KRAS and P53 mutations. The common sporadic colorectal cancers are MS1 high, with many patients having BRAF and KRAS mutations. The sentinel node biopsy in colorectal cancer surgery may provide more definitive staging and perhaps modification of the extent of resection with better outcome as suggested by Dr. Saha. The identification of sentinel lymph nodes outside of the planned bowel resection may increase the resection biologically indicated by the sentinel lymph node location leading to better outcome. In a small study by Dr. Saha, the operation was enhanced in 21 % by extending the length of bowel resection, which increased node recovery to 18.5 nodes versus 12 nodes with the more conventional resection, increasing nodal recovery, and positivity to 60 % with reduction to five year recurrence rate to 9 % versus 27 % with the conventional resection. A new (Swiss) technique for pathologic node examination, the OSNA (the One Step Nucleic Acid diagnostic system), was presented which demonstrated increased detection of micro-metastases in a focused pathology study of 22 patients (Zuber) to 11 out of 15 patients versus the 7 micro-metastases identified by the standard single slide per node, and compared to 14 out of 15 with an intensive multi-slide technique. This suggests value in pursuing OSNA study by other centers with relevant clinical trials to establish its true value. An analysis of liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) emphasized the value of 10-year follow-up (DeAngelica). The 10-year survival of 102 patients among 612 patients was 17 % (Memorial Sloan Kettering data). At the five-year point 99 of 102 survivors were NED and 86 have been free of disease since the resection. The usual five-year figure after hepatic resection reveals that one-third of five-year survivors die from recurrence of distant disease suggesting the value of longer term follow-up in these patients. An additional question reviewed related to the role of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (with response rates in the 50 % range) to produce down staging of the hepatic metastases and allow one to retrieve these patients with possible residual disease. In a series of 116 patients who had hepatic resection of CRC metastases in presence of regional node metastases, post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (normally not candidates for resection) these patients were demonstrated to have a 95 % recurrence at median time of 9 months. This raises a cautionary note to the literature report of five-year survivals in the 20-30 % range for hepatic metastases in presence of extra hepatic disease. Such may reflect patient selection rather than a true measure of the biology of disease, and warrant clinical trial evaluation. Lastly, regional therapy and overall systemic therapy were addressed by Dr. Kemeny. The CALGB study of hepatic artery infusion (HAI) with FUDR, dexamethasone versus 5FU leucovorin showed an overall survival of 24.4 months with HAI versus 20 months with systemic therapy (P = 0.0034).

An adjuvant trial of HAI at MSK in 156 patients showed an overall survival benefit at 2 year and recent long term 10yr follow-up showing a significant overall survival of 41 % with HAI versus 27 % with systemic therapy (5FU leucovorin). In the neoadjuvant Nordlinger trial for hepatic metastases, there was a significant outcome differences-the preoperative therapy group had 9.2 % increase of progression free survival versus the surgery alone group which suggests the value of combining neoadjuvant surgery in good risk liver resection candidates. Conclude the final lesson from this well presented mini symposium confirms the need for continued evaluation of the numerous discussion points by clinical trial.

Although good functional assays exist to measure these tumor parameters, and their use has led to the understanding of factors affecting outcome after radiotherapy, their application in clinical practice is hampered by technical difficulties, the length of time needed to obtain results and the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials. Recently, with the progress in molecular biology, genome-wide screening methods have been used to look for genetic signatures that can distinguish between good and bad outcome after radiotherapy. One of the most promising candidates is the epidermal growth factor receptor which is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of malignancies, such lung and head and neck cancer. Inhibition of this receptor has led to radio-sensitization with the prolongation of median survival in several cancers. Since there is significant variability in the response of patients with the same disease to radiotherapy, it would be very valuable to be able to predict which patients would benefit from a molecularly targeted therapy administered with concomitant radiation in order to increase the response rate (and cure rate) of those patients with radioresistant tumors. Optimally, this assay should be able to provide results in an efficient and reproducible manner and detect tumor genetic mutations that would provide specificity to the intervention. One approach currently in clinical practice to overcome intrinsic radioresistance and repopulation is stereotactic body radiotherapy coupled with image-guided radiation, a highly precise and powerful form of radiation, allowing radiation oncologist to treat tumors with more aggressive biological doses of radiation without causing serious normal tissues injury.

Oxysterols play critical roles in normal physiologic functions as well as in pathophysiologic processes in a variety of organ systems. This review provides an overview of oxysterol biology from the vantage point of the biliary system. Several oxysterols have been identified in human bile in the context of biliary tract infection and inflammation. This finding has led to investigations regarding the potential pathophysiologic significance of biliary oxysterols in diseases affecting the biliary system, with an emphasis on cholangiocarcinoma. Emerging evidence implicates specific oxysterols in the development and progression of this malignancy.

We investigated the relationships among the levels of these cytokines by assessing clinical findings, liver histology and viremia. Sixty untreated patients and 28 healthy individuals were included in the study. Cytokine levels were determined using ELISA. Differences between HCV and control groups were identified in the median levels of IL-17F (controls = 172.4 pg/mL; HCV = 96.8 pg/mL, p <0.001) and IL-8 (controls = 30.1 pg/mL; HCV = 18.1 pg/mL, p <0.05). IL-6 levels were higher in patients presenting moderate liver necroinflammation than in patients with mild or no liver necroinflammation (p <0.05). IL-17F levels were increased in patients that had increased ALT levels. Additionally, a strong positive correlation was observed between IL-17F and IL-22 levels in the two groups investigated, and the IL-17F/IL-22 ratio was lower in the patients infected with HCV (p < 0.0001). Patients with low HCV viral loads had higher median levels of IL-8 (32.5 pg/mL) than did patients with high HCV loads (16.7 pg/mL, p <0.05). These results suggest that in chronic hepatitis C infection, IL-17F and IL-8 could be associated with the control of liver injury and infection, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The bioreactors might be intended for generation of cell inoculum and production, research, process development, validation, or transfer purposes. During these activities, not only the difficulty of up and downscaling might lead to failure of consistency in cell growth, but also the use of different bioreactor geometries and operation conditions. In such cases, criteria for bioreactor design and process transfer should be carefully evaluated in order to select appropriate cultivation parameters. In this work, power input, mixing time, impeller tip speed, and Reynolds number have been compared systematically for the cultivation of the human cell line AGE1.HN within three partner laboratories using five different bioreactor systems. Proper operation ranges for the bioreactors were identified using the maximal cell-specific growth rate (mu(max)) as indicator. Common optimum values for process transfer criteria were found in these geometrically different bioreactors, in which deviations of mu(max) between cultivation systems can be importantly reduced. The data obtained in this work are used for process standardization and comparability of results obtained in different bioreactor systems, i.e. to guarantee lab-to-lab consistency for systems biology approaches using mammalian cells.

A variety of dissimilatory sulfur metabolisms, i.e. reactions used for energy conservation, are found in archaea from both the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla. Although not yet fully characterized, major processes include aerobic elemental sulfur (S0) oxidation, anaerobic S0 reduction, anaerobic sulfate/sulfite reduction and anaerobic respiration of organic sulfur. Assimilatory sulfur metabolism, i.e. reactions used for biosynthesis of sulfur-containing compounds, also possesses some novel features. Cysteine biosynthesis in some archaea uses a unique tRNA-dependent pathway. Fe-S cluster biogenesis in many archaea differs from that in bacteria and eukaryotes and requires unidentified components. The eukaryotic ubiquitin system is conserved in archaea and involved in both protein degradation and biosynthesis of sulfur-containing cofactors.

In this study, an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and a selection of saccharide were applied to A. castellanii by chemical mutagenesis. To understand the functional roles of a mannose-binding protein (MBP). A. castellanii were treated with methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside abbreviated Man, with and without the EMS pre-treatment, and their adhesion and cytotoxicity were analyzed, using a human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) as the target cell. Both EMS and Man mutants exhibited significantly decreased levels of MBP expression and cytotoxicity to HBMEC, but showed similar levels of binding to HBMEC, as compared with the wild type. Of interest was that the exogenous mannose inhibited amoebae (i.e.. Man mutant) binding to the HBMEC by <20%. Only the mutant Man exhibited a significant decrease in bacterial uptake, as compared to the wild type, 0.020 vs 0.032 (p < 0.05) and proteolytic activity. The results showed that MBP should be clearly provided as the pathogenic target candidate, to further target-based therapy, but EMS mutation should not be associated with initial adhesion and phagocytosis of A. castellanii.

The authors report in this article a new zebrafish transgenic line Tg(-4725sox10:Cre)ba74. This line expresses Cre under the control of a well-characterized portion of the sox10 promoter and, by crossing to a floxed-reporter line, the authors show in this article that expression in this line is consistent with those described for GFP reporter lines using the same promoter. Reporter expression is readily detected in patterns consistent with the early expression domains. Thus, the authors see all major groups (pigment, neural, and skeletal) of NC-derived cell-types, as well as cell-types derived from the known non-NC sites of sox10 expression, including otic epithelium and oligodendrocytes.

There is evidence that this noise can cause reactions on the behavior of the fish resulting in reduced catches. To mitigate the problem and the conflict of interest between the fishing industry and the seismic exploration interest, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) commissioned SINTEF Information and Communication Technology (ICT, Trondheim, Norway) and the Department of Biology, University of Oslo (Oslo, Norway) to develop an acoustic-biological model to predict the impact of seismic noise on the fish population. The ultimate goal is to develop an acoustic-biological model to use in the design and planning of seismic surveys such that the disturbance to fishing interest is minimized. This acoustic module of the model is based on ray theory and can deal with range-dependent bathymetry and depth-dependent sound-speed profiles. The bottom is modeled as a sedimentary fluid layer over a solid elastic rock and the model requires the thickness and seismoacoustic properties of the sediments layer and the rock with compressional speed, shear speed, and absorption. The model simulates the total sound field, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain, out to very large distances. Calculated sound exposure levels are compared with startle response levels for cod. Preliminary conclusions indicate a required distance in the range of 5-10 km, but dependent on the depth and the season. In additions, under certain conditions, there will appear regions with hot spots where the sound level is significantly higher due to caustics and focusing of sound. Modeled results are compared with results obtained from a joint seismoacoustic survey conducted in summer 2009 at Vesteralen-Lofoten area (Nordland VII). In this experiment, signals were recorded at fixed hydrophone positions as the seismic vessel approached from a maximum distance of 30 km toward the receiving positions. The same situation was modeled using available geological and oceanographic information as input to the acoustic model. The agreement between the real and recorded signals and the model results is good. This indicates that in the future acoustic-biological models may be used in the design and planning of seismic surveys such that the disturbance to fishing is minimized.

Today, the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) provides increasingly higher energy beams, up to 150 keV combined with higher brilliance (10(13) X-ray photons/sec). This means that detectors suffer from low X-ray absorption at high spatial resolution (1-10 mu m) and from radiation damage in tomography and diffraction applications. In addition, more and more experiments in medicine require the absorbed dose by the sample to be reduced. In this context, more efficient scintillators are developed and evaluated at the ESRF. In order to perform sub-micrometer and micrometer resolution imaging scintillators 1 mu m to 500 mu m thin are required. Single Crystal Film scintillators (SCF), 1 mu m to 100 mu m can be obtained via Liquid Phase Epitaxy for sub-micrometer resolution. Transparent ceramics, 100 mu m to 500 mu m thick are promising candidates for X-ray imaging requiring high X-ray absorption and good contrast with micrometer resolution. Commonly available scintillators, such as CdWO4 and YAG:Ce suffer from low efficiency, therefore new scintillators with higher light yield and stopping-power are required.

Although several methods have been developed recently to reconstruct biological networks, there are few systematic and comprehensive studies that compare different methods in terms of their ability to handle incomplete datasets, high data dimensions and noisy data. The authors use experimentally measured and synthetic datasets to compare three popular methods - principal component regression (PCR), linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) - in terms of root-mean-squared error (RMSE), average fractional error in the value of the coefficients, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity. This comparison enables the authors to establish criteria for selection of an appropriate approach for network reconstruction based on a priori properties of experimental data. For instance, although PCR is the fastest method, LASSO and LMI perform better in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Both PCR and LASSO are better than LMI in terms of fractional error in the values of the computed coefficients. Trade-offs such as these suggest that more than one aspect of each method needs to be taken into account when designing strategies for network reconstruction.

Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis. Currently, surgical tumor debulking followed by chemotherapy based on platinum and taxane is the standard treatment for advanced disease. However, these patients remain at great risk for recurrence and developing drug resistance. Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed to improve outcomes for patients with advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. Several agents targeted at particular molecules have been developed for ovarian cancer and are now entering clinical trials. The functional targets of these agents are aberrations in tumor tissues including angiogenesis, the human epidermal growth factor receptor family, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and alpha-folate receptor (alpha-FR). The anti-angiogenic compound bevacizumab has been reported as the most effective targeted agent. Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) both for advanced and platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, but did not increase overall survival. A PARP inhibitor, olaparib, applied as maintenance treatment also improved PFS in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. Furthermore, mTOR inhibitors and a monoclonal antibody to alpha-FR, farletuzumab, are attractive treatment strategies either alone or combined with chemotherapy. Understanding the tumor molecular biology and identifying predictive biomarkers are essential steps in selecting the best treatment strategies.

Patients' personal beliefs about depression and antidepressants are regarded as central influences on adherence.

Objectives: The aim was to gain detailed insight into patients' personal accounts of depression and use of antidepressant medication and to relate these accounts to the patients' self-reported level of adherence.

Methods: In-depth, qualitative interviews of 16 depressed patients one, four, eight and twelve months after hospital discharge supplemented by diagnostic interviews and self-report measures. Kleinman's notion of ""explanatory model"" was used as the theoretical perspective on the patients' illness narratives. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically with ""explanatory models"" as the starting point.

Results: Patients had ambiguous experiences of depression and antidepressants. Patients explained their illness and the medical treatment in experience-near terms. Explanations of the reasons for depression were psychosocial and biology and medicine were not central. However, taking antidepressant medication was a meaningful part of being admitted to hospital, and the adoption of the rhetoric and practices of biomedicine strengthened patients' sense of control and hope for recovery. If medicine was ineffective, the explanatory models legitimised alternative strategies towards recovery, including non-adherence.

Conclusions: The patients' reasons for adhering to antidepressants included a range of diverse psychosocial issues, and could be regarded as a central part of their common sense illness management.

We designed three multiplex panels allowing genotyping of 10 polymorphic loci and scrutinized them on 42 samples from two different regions inhabited by two different house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus). The numbers of alleles ranged from 2 to 6 with mean observed heterozygosities 0.1476 and 0.2095 for domesticus and musculus worms, respectively. The described markers will facilitate further studies on population biology and co-evolution of this host-parasite system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we identified and quantified 4623 Kac sites in 1800 Kac proteins in SIRT1(+/+) and SIRT1(-/-) MEF cells, representing the first study to reveal an enzyme-regulated Kac subproteome and the largest Lys acetylome reported to date from a single study. Four hundred eighty-five Kac sites were enhanced by more than 100% after SIRT1 knockout. Our results indicate that SIRT1 regulates the Kac states of diverse cellular pathways. Interestingly, we found that a number of acetyltransferases and major acetyltransferase complexes are targeted by SIRT1. Moreover, we showed that the activities of the acetyltransferases are regulated by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation. Taken together, our results reveal the Lys acetylome in response to SIRT1, provide new insights into mechanisms of SIRT1 function, and offer biomarker candidates for the clinical evaluation of SIRT1-activator compounds.

In general, nanoscience-based approaches have circumvented limitations in the delivery of cancer therapeutics, related to their poor aqueous solubility and toxicity issues with conventional vehicles and resulted in improved pharmacokinetics and biodisiribution. Included in the discussion are promising examples and pharmaceutical perspectives on liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, carbon nanotubes and magnetic nanoparticles.

We engineered sender, processor and receiver cells that interact with each other in ways that resemble natural intercellular communication networks such as multistep information processing cascades, feed-forward-based signaling loops, and two-way communication.

The present study aims to establish an in vitro system for developmental neurotoxicity testing employing mESCs. We developed a robust and reproducible protocol for fast and efficient differentiation of the mESC line D3 into neural cells, optimized with regard to chemical testing.

Morphological examination and immunocytochemical staining confirmed the presence of different neural cell types, including neural progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and radial glial cells. Neurons derived from D3 cells expressed the synaptic proteins PSD95 and synaptophysin, and the neurotransmitters serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Calcium ion imaging revealed the presence of functionally active glutamate and dopamine receptors. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of the neuron-specific marker protein MAP2 on day 12 after induction of differentiation demonstrated a concentration dependent effect of the neurodevelopmental toxicants methylmercury chloride, chlorpyrifos, and lead acetate on neuronal differentiation.

The current study shows that D3 mESCs differentiate efficiently into neural cells involving a neurosphere-like state and that this system is suitable to detect adverse effects of neurodevelopmental toxicants. Therefore, we propose that the protocol for differentiation of mESCs into neural cells described here could constitute one component of an in vitro testing strategy for developmental neurotoxicity.

The ability to integrate a specifically engineered piece of DNA into the genome of a living system is fundamental to our efforts to understand life and exploit its implications for medicine, nanotechnology and bioprospecting. However, transgenesis has been hampered by position effects and multi-copy integration problems, which are mainly due to the use of small, plasmid-based transgenes. Large transgenes based on native genomic regions cloned into bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) circumvent these problems but are prone to fragmentation. Herein, we report that contrary to widely held notions, large BAC-sized constructs do not prohibit transposition. We also report the first reliable method for BAC transgenesis in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The PiggyBac or Sleeping Beauty transposon inverted repeats were integrated into BAC vectors by recombineering, followed by co-lipofection with the corresponding transposase in hESCs to generate robust fluorescent protein reporter lines for OCT4, NANOG, GATA4 and PAX6. BAC transposition delivers several advantages, including increased frequencies of single-copy, full-length integration, which will be useful in all transgenic systems but especially in difficult venues like hESCs.

The best-developed answer, Craver's causal-mechanical account, has several weaknesses. It does not fully explicate the target of explanation, interlevel relation, or interactive nonmodular character of many biological mechanisms as we understand them. An alternative account of MEx, emphasizing interdependence among a mechanism's components ('jointness'), remedies these difficulties.

This ability is typically studied in the lab by asking observers to indicate their estimate of the time between two external sensory events. The results of such studies confirm that humans can accurately estimate durations on a variety of time scales. Although many brain areas are thought to contribute to the representation of elapsed time, recent neurophysiological studies have linked the parietal cortex in particular to the perception of sub-second time intervals. In this Primer, we describe previous work on parietal cortex and time perception, and we highlight the findings of a study published in this issue of PLOS Biology, in which Schneider and Ghose [1] characterize single-neuron responses during performance of a novel ""Temporal Production"" task. During temporal production, the observer must track the passage of time without anticipating any external sensory event, and it appears that the parietal cortex may use a unique strategy to support this type of measurement.

Some internal structures are distributed asymmetrically to the right or left side. A conserved Nodal and BMP signaling system directs molecular pathways that impart the sidedness to those asymmetric structures. In the sea urchin embryo, one such asymmetrical structure, oddly enough, is the entire adult, which grows out of left sided structures produced in the larva. In a paper just published in PLOS Biology, BMP signaling is shown to be necessary early in larval development to initiate the asymmetric specification of one of those left-sided structures, called the left coelomic pouch. This study reports that BMP signaling activates a group of transcription factors asymmetrically in the left coelomic pouch only, which launch the pathway that eventually leads to the formation of the adult that emerges from the larva at metamorphosis.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was first established in 1958, when it was recognized that the recurrence rate and patient outcomes were directly related to the degree of tumor spread at the patient's initial presentation. Changes in understanding of tumor biology led to a recent update in the FIGO staging system that reflects the variation in treatment strategies between endometrial and cervical cancer. Patients with endometrial cancer are primarily treated with hysterectomy; thus, staging is done at surgery and histologic analysis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may accurately depict the extent of endometrial cancer at diagnosis and, in conjunction with the tumor grade and histologic subtype, help stratify risk, which determines the therapeutic course. Cervical carcinoma is staged at clinical examination because many tumors are inoperable at the time of patient presentation. Preoperative MR imaging criteria are not formally included in the revised FIGO staging system because cervical carcinoma is most prevalent in developing countries, where imaging resources are limited. However, MR imaging is highly sensitive and specific for depicting important prognostic factors and, when available, is recommended as an adjunct to clinical examination. The MR imaging findings of uterine carcinoma should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting in conjunction with clinical and histologic findings, an approach that provides accurate staging and risk stratification and allows for individualized treatment.

The in vitro recapitulation of tissue-like structures is meaningful, not only for fundamental cell biology research, but also for tissue engineering (TE). Currently, TE research adopts either the top-down or bottom-up approach. The top-down approach involves defining the macroscopic tissue features using biomaterial scaffolds and seeding cells into these scaffolds. Conversely, the bottom-up approach aims at crafting small tissue building blocks with precision-engineered structural and functional microscale features, using physical and/or chemical approaches. The bottom-up strategy takes advantage of the repeating structural and functional units that facilitate cell-cell interactions and cultures multiple cells together as a functional unit of tissue.

Despite of lacking a nucleus and genomic DNA, platelets possess diverse types of RNAs, ranging from protein coding messenger RNAs to small non-coding RNAs inherited from their parent megakaryocytes. Indeed, platelets are capable of using their own translational machinery to synthesise proteins upon their activation suggesting the possibility of post-transcriptional gene regulation in platelets. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, tiny non-coding RNAs exhibiting a fine-tune control of protein expression by complementary sequence recognition, binding and translational repression of protein coding mRNA transcripts. Multiple functional aspects of miRNAs as well as their expression in platelets or megakaryocytes underscore a role in platelet biology. Changes in miRNA expression patterns have been noted during platelet genesis and activation. In the present review we highlight recently identified megakaryocytic/platelet miRNAs and discuss their role in platelet biogenesis and functions essential to maintain haemostasis in the body.

To better understand their diffusion dynamics and membrane compartmentalization, we labeled lipid raft constituent ganglioside GM1 with single quantum dots through the connection of cholera toxin B subunit, a protein that binds specifically to GM1. Diffusion measurements revealed that single quantum dot-labeled GM1 ganglioside complexes undergo slow, confined lateral diffusion with a diffusion coefficient of similar to 7.87 X 10(-2) mu m(2)/s and a confinement domain about 200 nm in size. Further analysis of their trajectories showed lateral confinement persisting on the order of tens of seconds, comparable to the time scales of the majority of cellular signaling and biological reactions. Hence, our results provide further evidence in support of the putative function of lipid rafts as signaling platforms.

An ideal delivery system should encapsulate and protect the siRNA cargo from serum proteins, exhibit target tissue and cell specificity, penetrate the cell surface, and release its cargo in the desired intracellular compartment. One approach to the design of delivery vehicles that meets all of these requirements utilizes the systematic assembly of multiple components that can address each barrier. This rational approach was adopted by Ren et al., who designed novel myristoylated tandem peptides that consist of a tumor-targeting module and a cell-penetrating module, as described in this issue of ACS Nano. These tandem peptides were formulated with siRNAs into nanocomplexes for cell-specific delivery to a variety of tumor cell lines. The correlation of the structural properties of the nanocomplex to cell-type-specific activity via a computational approach identified the valence of the tumor-targeting ligand and overall nanocomplex charge as important parameters for the activity of the formulations. The in vivo gene silencing potency of these peptide-based nanocomplex formulations was demonstrated by Ren et al. in an ovarian cancer model. Tumor-penetrating nanocomplexes carrying a siRNA sequence against a novel oncogene (ID4) led to a significant reduction in tumor burden and an 80% increase in mouse survival. As such, the combination of a systematic approach with computational modeling can be advantageous for improving the delivery and potency of siRNA therapeutics.

The most significant challenge for using DNAzymes in vivo pertains to nontoxic delivery and maintaining function inside cells. We synthesized multivalent deoxyribozyme ""10-23"" gold nanoparticle (DzNP) conjugates, varying DNA density, linker length, enzyme orientation, and linker composition in order to study the role of the steric environment and gold surface chemistry on catalysis. DNAzyme catalytic efficiency was modulated by steric packing and pro.iimity of the active loop to the gold surface. Importantly, the 10-23 DNAzyme was asymmetrically sensitive to the gold surface and when anchored through the 5' terminus was nhibited 32-fold. This property was used to generate DNAzymes whose catalytic activity is triggered by thiol displacement reactions or by photoexcitation at lambda = 532 nm.

However, the use of plasmids imposes limitations on the size of synthetic gene circuits and the ease with which they can be placed into bacterial hosts. For instance, unique selective markers must be used for each plasmid to ensure their maintenance in the host. These selective markers are most often genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin or kanamycin. However, the simultaneous use of multiple antibiotics to retain different plasmids can place undue stress on the host and increase the cost of growth media. To address this problem, we have developed a method for stably transforming three different plasmids in E. colt using a single antibiotic selective marker. To do this, we first examined two different systems with which two plasmids may be maintained. These systems make use of either T7 RNA polymerase-specific regulation of the resistance gene or split antibiotic resistance enzymes encoded on separate plasmids. Finally, we combined the two methods to create system with which three plasmids can be transformed and stably maintained using a single selective marker. This work shows that large-scale plasmid-based synthetic gene circuits need not be limited by the use of multiple antibiotic resistance genes.

The synthetic gene regulatory circuit is designed to permanently alter gene expression in response to the well characterized inflammatory signal, nitric oxide. The detection of nitric oxide initiates the expression of a DNA recombinase, causing the permanent activation of a DNA switch. We demonstrate that E. coil containing this synthetic circuit respond to nitric oxide from both chemical and biological sources, with permanent DNA recombination occurring in the presence of nitric oxide donor compounds or inflamed mouse ileum explants. In the future, this synthetic genetic circuit will be optimized to allow E. coli to reliably detect and respond to inflammation in vivo.

The next generation of multigene circuits will control the triggering, amplitude, and duration of therapeutic activity in vivo. This will require a host organism that is easy to genetically modify, leverages existing successful circuit designs, and has the potential for use in humans.

While most synthetic gene networks have been explored within microbes, there is a need for further characterization of in vivo circuit behavior in the context of applications where the host microbes are actively being investigated for efficacy and safety, such as tumor drug delivery. One major hurdle is that culture-based selective pressures are absent in vivo, leading to strain-dependent instability of plasmid-based networks over time. Here, we experimentally characterize the dynamics of in vivo plasmid instability using attenuated strains of S. typhimurium and real time monitoring of luminescent reporters. Computational modeling described the effects of growth rate and dosage on live-imaging signals generated by internal bacterial populations.

Furthermore, we demonstrate a multiplexer-decoder circuit. The ribozymes are designed to seek-and-destroy specific RNAs with a certain length by a fully computerized procedure. The algorithm can accurately predict one base substitution that alters the ribozyme's logic function. The ability to sense the length of RNA molecules enables single ribozymes to be used as platforms for multiple interactions. These ribozymes can work as integrated circuits with the functionality of up to five logic gates. The ribozyme design is universal since the allosteric and substrate domains can be altered to sense different RNAs. In addition, the ribozymes can specifically cleave RNA molecules with triplet-repeat expansions observed in genetic disorders such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.

Virginia-type peanuts, harvested from plots treated with mineral salts combinations that mimic the subunit compositions of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) were analyzed for fatty acid and arachin compositions by HPLC and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. Fatty acid desaturase and arachin encoding mRNAs were analyzed by Northern hybridization using the homologous RNAs synthesized by peanut GDH as probes. There were 70-80 % sequence similarities between the GDH-synthesized RNAs and the mRNAs encoding arachins, fatty acid desaturases, glutamate synthase, and nitrate reductase, which similarities induced permutation of the metabolic pathways at the mRNA level. Modeling of mRNAs showed there were 210, 3,150, 1,260, 2,520, and 4,200 metabolic permutations in the control, NPKS-, NS-, Pi-, NH4Cl-, and PK-treated peanuts, respectively. The mRNA cross-talks decreased the arachin to almost zero percent in the NPKS- and PK-treated peanuts, and linoleate to similar to 18 % in the PK-treated peanut. The mRNA cross-talks may account for the vastly reported environmentally induced variability in the linoleate contents of peanut genotypes.

This includes the study of the timing and relationships of the two major clades of extant mammals - marsupials and placenta's. Molecular studies concerned with marsupial and placental origin and diversification can be at odds with the fossil record. Such studies are, however, not a recent phenomenon. Over 150 years ago Charles Darwin weighed two alternative views on the origin of marsupials and placentals. Less than a year after the publication of On the origin of species, Darwin outlined these in a letter to Charles Lyell dated 23 September 1860. The letter concluded with two competing phylogenetic diagrams. One showed marsupials as ancestral to both living marsupials and placentals, whereas the other showed a non-marsupial, non-placental as being ancestral to both living marsupials and placentals. These two diagrams are published here for the first time. These are the only such competing phylogenetic diagrams that Darwin is known to have produced. In addition to examining the question of mammalian origins in this letter and in other manuscript notes discussed here, Darwin confronted the broader issue as to whether major groups of animals had a single origin (monophyly) or were the result of ""continuous creation"" as advocated for some groups by Richard Owen. Charles Lyell had held similar views to those of Owen, but it is clear from correspondence with Darwin that he was beginning to accept the idea of monophyly of major groups.

In Britain, the growth of biology followed T. H. Huxley's principle of teaching the characters of certain plants and animals selected as types of vegetable and animal organization, which brought demands for marine specimens for dissection. The history of the provision of such material in Britain is investigated, particularly apropos of the Marine Station at Millport. Supplementary information is presented on the equally long-standing specimen trade at Plymouth and on two small commercial concerns that supplied marine specimens (from the Isle of Luing and Shoreham-by-Sea). The demise of the specimen-supply trade in Britain in recent decades has resulted from curriculum changes in schools and universities no longer requiring students to do dissections (relating also to Health and Safety concerns about formalin-preserved material); and biology departments that can often no longer, as a result of financial stringency, afford the ""luxury"" of supplying students with the range of practical experiences that previous generations once valued so highly. The concern among some students about the ethics, or religious strictures, surrounding dissection is acknowledged.

Despite IDPs being present in all kingdoms of life, they are more abundant in eukaryotes where they are involved in the vast majority of regulation and signalling processes. The realization that, in some cases, functional states of proteins were partly or fully disordered was in contradiction to the traditional view where a well defined three-dimensional structure was required for activity. Several experimental evidences indicate, however, that structural features in IDPs such as transient secondary-structural elements and overall dimensions are crucial to their function. NMR has been the main tool to study IDP structure by probing conformational preferences at residue level. Additionally, SAXS (small-angle X-ray scattering) has the capacity to report on the three-dimensional space sampled by disordered states and therefore complements the local information provided by NMR. The present review describes how the synergy between NMR and SAXS can be exploited to obtain more detailed structural and dynamic models of IDPs in solution.

These so called IDPs (intrinsically disordered proteins) or intrinsically disordered regions constitute up to 40% of all expressed proteins, and a much higher percentage in proteins involved in the proliferation of cancer. For these proteins, there is a need to develop new methods for structural characterization which exploit their biophysical properties. IM (ion mobility)-MS is uniquely able to examine both absolute conformation(s), populations of conformation and also conformational change, and is therefore highly applicable to the study of IDPs. The present article details the technique of IM-MS and illustrates its use in assessing the relative disorder of the wild-type p53 DNA-core-binding domain of cellular tumour antigen p53. The IM data were acquired on a Waters Synapt HDMS instrument following nESI (nanoelectrospray ionization) from 'native' and low-pH solution conditions.

LRRK2 is a complex molecule containing domains implicated in protein interactions, as well as kinase and GTPase activities. The observation that the common G2019S mutation increases kinase activity in vitro suggests that altered phosphorylation of LRRK2 targets may have pathological outcomes. Given that protein kinases are ideal targets for drug therapies, much effort has been directed at understanding the role of LRRK2 kinase activity on disease onset. However, no clear physiological substrates have been identified to date, indicating that much research is still needed to fully understand the signalling pathways orchestrated by LRRK2 and deregulated under pathological conditions.

","Abstract: Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) have been linked to inherited forms of PD (Parkinson's disease). Substantial pre-clinical research and drug discovery efforts have focused on LRRK2 with the hope that small-molecule inhibitors of the enzyme may be valuable for the treatment or prevention of the onset of PD. The pathway to develop therapeutic or neuroprotective agents based on LRRK2 function (i.e. kinase activity) has been facilitated by the development of both biochemical and cell-based assays for LRRK2. LRRK2 is phosphorylated on Ser(910), Ser(935), Ser(955) and Ser(973) in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme, and these sites of phosphorylation are likely to be regulated by upstream enzymes in an LRRK2 kinase-activity-dependent manner. Knowledge of these phosphorylation sites and their regulation can be adapted to high-throughput-screening-amenable platforms. The present review describes the utilization of LRRK2 phosphorylation as indicators of enzyme inhibition, as well as how such assays can be used to deconvolute the pathways in which LRRK2 plays a role.

We performed a thorough assessment of such research, evaluating urban wildlife publications from 16 leading journals in animal behavior, conservation, ecology, general science, landscape ecology, and wildlife biology from 1971 to 2010. Using a systematic review process, we quantified trends in urban wildlife research over time and in different scientific fields, and also assessed author affiliations, geographic and taxonomic focus, research topics, and study site types. In general, rates of publication for urban wildlife research have been increasing, although still remain low (<2% of publication volume) considering urban growth and its impacts on biodiversity are accelerating globally. Landscape ecology and wildlife biology journals, followed by conservation journals, published the highest percentage of urban wildlife publications, whereas such studies were rare in animal behavior, ecology, and general science journals. Academics were first-authors on ca. 75% of urban wildlife publications, whereas research directed by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and private industry were less common, with little evidence of temporal shifts in these patterns. The majority of urban research studied birds or mammals, and nearly all was conducted in North America, Europe, or Australia, as expected given expansive urban development and associated research focus. Animal behavior was the most common scientific topic in urban wildlife research, followed by conservation, landscape ecology, wildlife management, and population ecology. While suburban and exurban development have been recently identified as an important issue, we found no evidence that research in these study systems has increased. Author affiliation, geographic location, taxonomic focus, and research topics of urban wildlife studies were generally similar to those conducted in non-urban systems, although avian studies were more common, and African and community ecology studies less common, in urban compared to non-urban areas. We suggest that the most critical gaps for urban wildlife researchers are in rapidly urbanizing areas in South America, Africa, and Asia, and on understudied taxa such as herpetiles, fish, and arthropods. Research conducted on multiple taxa and across continents is also rare, but will be necessary for global understanding of ecological dynamics of urban systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Limited tools are available for guiding the selection of translocation sites, however, particularly when establishing rescue populations outside of historic ranges. We developed a Bayesian network model framework for translocation site selection for island birds. The model consisted of four primary components including ecological requirements for survival, anthropogenic threats at the population establishment site, effects the translocated species may have on native species, and operational support associated with the translocation process and ongoing management. We then used the model to identify potential sites for the establishment of a wild population of Guam Micronesian kingfishers (Todiramphus cinnamominus cinnamominus) on an island outside the bird's historic range. Conditional probabilities that guided model evaluations were allocated using information from the literature, expert opinions, and a training set of islands outside the region under consideration for releases. The model was used to evaluate 239 islands where a translocation population of Micronesian kingfishers could be established. Five islands, all in the Federated States of Micronesia, were identified as being suitable for assisted colonization, including Kosrae, Yap, Faichuk, Weno and Fefan. Sensitivity analysis showed a correspondence between model variables and island characteristics indicated by the literature as being the most important for successful translocation. We found the Bayesian network model to be a useful tool for translocation site selection despite limited information on the natural history of the Guam Micronesian kingfisher and the factors that impact the success of translocations.

They inhibit the translation of proteins from mRNA or promote its degradation. Aberrant miRNA expression has been linked to various human diseases and measurement can differentiate between normal and diseased tissue. Expression is tissue-specific and any changes in miRNA expression within a tissue type can be correlated with disease status. Altered miRNA expression has been reported in the smoking-related diseases cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, miRNAs are thought to have vital roles in inflammatory cell differentiation and regulation. miRNAs might, therefore, be useful biomarkers for early detection of disease-related molecular and genetic changes. In this review, we summarize the available scientific evidence for the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers of smoking-related diseases. Studies should be carried out to identify the miRNAs most relevant to specific diseases.

However, recruitment in natural populations is highly variable and rarely well described by classical stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs). Recent analyses suggest that the age composition of the spawning biomass may play an important role in the mismatch between SRRs and data. Here we develop a generalization of the Ricker SRR that incorporates age structure by allowing mortality and fecundity rates to depend on maternal age. We provide a flexible SRR with biologically interpretable parameters that can be estimated from existing fisheries time series and use a Bayesian framework that enables parameters to be informed by experimental data. We apply our method to the Icelandic population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and show models that include age structure effects outperform the classical Ricker SRR that ignores age structure. Our results indicate a strong effect of spawning stock age structure on recruitment dynamics in this population. Our approach provides a biologically interpretable and immediately applicable method for investigating the consequences for spawning stock age structure on recruitment.

The determination of the stability of HO4- in water therefore has the greatest relevance for better understanding the mechanism associated with oxidative cascades in aqueous solution. However, experiments are difficult to perform because of the short-lived character of this species, and in this work we have employed DFT, CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS), MRCI/aug-cc-pVTZ, and combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to investigate this topic. We show that the HO4- anion has a planar structure in the gas phase, with a very large HOO?OO bond length (1.823 angstrom). In contrast, HO4- adopts a nonplanar configuration in aqueous solution, with huge geometrical changes (up to 0.232 angstrom for the HOO?OO bond length) with a very small energy cost. The formation of the HO4- anion is predicted to be endergonic by 5.53 +/- 1.44 and 2.14 +/- 0.37 kcal?mol-1 with respect to the O3 + HO- and HO2 + O2- channels, respectively. Moreover, the combination of theoretical calculations with experimental free energies of solvation has allowed us to obtain accurate free energies for the main reactions involved in the aqueous decomposition of ozone. Thus, the oxygen transfer reaction (O3 + OH- ? HO2 + O2-) is endergonic by 3.39 +/- 1.80 kcal?mol-1, the electron transfer process (O3 + O2- ? O3- + O2) is exergonic by 31.53 +/- 1.05 kcal?mol-1, supporting the chain-carrier role of the superoxide ion, and the reaction O3 + HO2- ? OH + O2- + O2 is exergonic by 12.78 +/- 1.15 kcal?mol-1, which is consistent with the fact that the addition of small amounts of HO2- (through H2O2) accelerates ozone decomposition in water. The combination of our results with previously reported thermokinetic data provides some insights into the potentially important role of the HO4- anion as a key reaction intermediate.

Nitrogen mineralization is the important process transferred from organic nitrogen to plant-available inorganic forms by soil animals and microorganism. Soil nitrogen mineralization processes in coastal wetlands will be greatly impacted by the significant changes of soil water and salt conditions caused by global climate change in the future. However, further studies concerning the effects of water and salt on soil nitrogen mineralization is still needed. The influences of other soil physicalchemical properties and plant community on soil nitrogen mineralization processes are also concluded. The influencing mechanism of soil nitrogen mineralization can be explained using the laboratory incubation, whereas the in situ incubation can contribute to reflecting the real nitrogen mineralization information in the field. The laboratory and in situ incubation methods combined with 15N tracing-isotope technique should be combined and applied to better reflect and explain soil nitrogen mineralization processes. Moreover, the applications of modern molecular biology techniques are also very necessary to quantitatively and accurately study nitrogen mineralization.

Yet, the reproductive biology of many deep-water corals, especially members of the subclass Octocorallia, has not been examined. We used histological techniques to describe the reproductive biology of the deep-water gorgonian coral Acanella arbuscula from the northwest Atlantic. All colonies examined were gonochoric, and no embryos or planula larvae were observed in the polyps. Mean polyp-level fecundity (females: 21.0 +/- 17.5 oocytes polyp(-1), and males: 13.9 +/- 13.5 sperm sacs polyp(-1)) is high compared to other deep-water gorgonians, and polyps closer to the branch tips had the highest fecundities in both females and males. The presence of large oocytes (maximum diameter 717.8 mu m) suggests that A. nrbuscula produces lecithotrophic larvae. Despite the potentially high fecundity and small size at first reproduction, the paucity of information on dispersal and recruitment, combined with its longevity, vulnerability to bottom fishing gear, and ecological role as a structure-forming species, still warrants the classification of A. arbuscula as a vulnerable marine ecosystem indicator.

The development, homeostasis, and effector functions of basophils are tightly regulated by extrinsic signals and in particular by cytokines. IL-3, GM-CSF, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin activate the STAT5 pathway that promotes proliferation, activation, and cytokine secretion but also induces a negative feedback loop via Pim-1 and SOCS proteins. Basophils further express receptors for IL-18 and IL-33, which are associated with the signaling adaptor MyD88 and activate the NF-?B and MAP kinase pathways.

Here an effective coating method is demonstrated and evaluated on SU-8 based 3D microstructures made by two-photon polymerization. Protein streptavidin and gold nanoparticles (NP) were bound to the microstructures utilizing acid treatment-mediated csilane chemistry. The protein surface density, quantified with single molecule fluorescence microscopy revealed that the protein forms a third of a monolayer on the two-photon polymerized structures. The surface coverage of the gold NPs on the microstructures was simply controlled with a single parameter. The possible degrading effect of the acid treatment on the sub-micrometer features of the TPP microstructures was analyzed.

Decontaminants were more effective on cells that were not still attached to their stalks. From the fishermen's perspective, didymo was the aquatic invasive species of highest concern, but there was a wide range of approaches to didymo control.

Patients with breast cancer were examined for pathologic factors predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, using an anthracycline-based regimen. For clinical histomorphology and biomarkers, factors were compared among 16 pathologically complete responses and 52 nonpathologically complete responses, using upivariate analysis and multivariate regression analysis of principal components, using preneoadjuvant chemotherapy needle biopsy samples as follows: degree of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, histologic grade, biology-based tumor type (hormone receptors and HER2 [human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2]), age, clinical TNM stage, and TNM staging. In univariate analysis, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, high histologic grade, and hormone receptors(-)/HER2(+) were significantly associated with pathologically complete responses (93.7%, P < .0001; 81.3%, P = .0206; 43.7%, P = .014, respectively). In multivariate principal component regression analysis, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were the best independent predictor for pathologically complete responses (odds ratio, 4.7; confidence interval, 2.2-10.06; P < .0001). Among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and biology-based tumor types, patients with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had pathologically complete responses more than nonpathologically complete responses, especially in the hormone receptors(-)/HER2(+) group. Among high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cases, T lymphocytes showed more predominant tendency than B lymphocytes in the pathologically complete responses cases, compared with nonpathologically complete responses cases. These findings indicate that high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are important predictors of pathologically complete responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially in the hormone receptors(-)/HER2(+) group.

We show here that the CD8(+) subset of splenic dendritic cells (DC), specialized in major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) presentation of exogenous antigens (cross-presentation), produce high levels of Sb9. Mice deficient in Sb9 are unable to generate a cytotoxic T-cell response against cell-associated antigen by cross-presentation, but maintain normal MHC-II presentation to helper T cells. This impaired cross-priming ability is autonomous to DC and is evident in animals deficient in both Sb9 and GrB, indicating that this role of Sb9 in DC is GrB-independent. In Sb9-deficient mice, CD8(+) DC develop normally, survive as well as wild-type DC after antigenic challenge, and exhibit unimpaired capacity to take up antigen. Although the core processing machinery is unaffected, Sb9-deficient DC appear to process antigen faster. Our results point to a novel, GrB-independent role for Sb9 in DC cross-priming.

In this review, we focus on the role of the T lineage-enriched chromatin organizer and regulator SATB1 in T-cell differentiation. SATB1 mediates Wnt signaling by recruiting beta-catenin to its genomic targets and coordinates T helper type 2 (T(H)2) differentiation by positively regulating GATA-3. In contrast, maintenance of regulatory T cell (Treg) functions are dependent on inhibition of SATB1-mediated modulation of global chromatin organization. We discuss how regulation of the activity of SATB1 has a critical role in driving these two important differentiation pathways in T cells.

Formulating mechanistic mathematical models combining regulatory networks at the transcriptional, translational and epigenetic level, we study how individual helper T cells may adopt their different phenotypes. For each cytokine phenotype, for example, T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 2 (Th2) cells, we find that the intracellular molecular network allows a cell to adopt one of the three states, which we interpret as naive, active and memory states. Cell division markedly speeds up the differentiation into a particular memory state because of DNA demythelation. In a memory state, cells readily resume production of the same cytokine they produced before. Using stochastic models we show that helper T-cell plasticity (that is, the ability to switch phenotype) is low during clonal expansion. Although most memory cells rapidly secrete the original cytokine upon restimulation, some adopt another phenotype and produce different cytokines, allowing for considerable diversity in the phenotypes that are adopted during a memory response. In summary, we show that helper T-cell division expedites cell differentiation by increasing DNA demethylation. We also show that plasticity is low during the clonal expansion phase, but that helper T cells may adopt alternative phenotypes during a memory response.

It is therefore unexpected that complement-deficient animals are less susceptible to carcinogen-induced tumours and more readily control growth of injected tumour cell lines than their wild-type counterparts, implying that complement promotes tumour development and progression. Conversely, natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cells are known to limit progression of the same tumours. Previous studies indicate that sublytic levels of the complement membrane attack complex protect cells against further attack by lytic doses of complement and other pore-formers such as perforin. We hypothesise that inefficient attack by complement in vivo allows tumour cells to avoid lysis by both NK cells and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells, thereby promoting tumour outgrowth. Complement could thus be limiting the efficacy of NK and T cell-targeted cancer therapies, and the inclusion of complement inhibitors could optimise these immunotherapeutic regimes.

Here, we have conducted a comprehensive ex vivo profiling of CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in a cohort of GBM patients. Of the patients analyzed, approximately half exhibited serological evidence of past infection with CMV. Although no CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses could be detected in the serologically negative GBM patients, virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected in all seropositive GBM patients. Using major histocompatibility complex-peptide multimers, the frequency of CMV-specific T-cells in the patients detected ranged from 0.1 to 22% of CD8(+) T-cells and a high proportion of these cells were positive for the human natural killer-1 glycoprotein CD57. Furthermore, ex vivo polychromatic functional analysis of the CMV-specific T-cells from GBM patients revealed that large proportions of these cells were unable to produce multiple cytokines (macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interferon (IFN)gamma) and displayed limited cytolytic function (CD107a mobilization) following stimulation with CMV peptide epitopes. However, in vitro stimulation with CMV peptide epitopes in the presence of gamma C cytokine dramatically reversed the polyfunctional profile of these antigen-specific T-cells with high levels of MIP-1 beta, TNF alpha, IFN gamma and CD107a mobilization. Most importantly, adoptive transfer of these in vitro-expanded T-cells in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) therapy into a patient with recurrent GBM was coincident with a long-term disease-free survival. These studies provide an important platform for a formal assessment of combination therapies based on CMV-specific T-cells and TMZ for recurrent GBM.

We have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (Traf)2(-/-) mice spontaneously develop severe colitis and that the development of colitis largely depends on TNF alpha-dependent apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the immunological disorders of Traf2(-/-) mice are not fully understood. Here we show that interleukin (IL)-10-secreting neutrophils accumulated in peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) cells from Traf2(-/-) mice compared with those from wild-type mice. Treatment of Traf2(-/-) mice with neutralizing antibody against TNF alpha or crossing Traf2(-/-) mice with Tnfr1(-/-) mice reduced the percentages of IL-10-secreting neutrophils, suggesting that the development of IL-10-secreting neutrophils largely depended on TNF alpha signals. Moreover, stimulation of BM cells from wild-type mice with lipopolysaccharide and Pam3CS(K)4, a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 and 2, respectively, induced differentiation of BM cells into IL-10-secreting neutrophils. These results suggest that the development of IL-10-secreting neutrophils is not restricted to Traf2(-/-) mice, but could be generalized to wild-type mice under certain conditions such as inflammation. Finally, combined treatment of Traf2(-/-) mice with neutralizing antibodies against TNF alpha and IL-10, but not each antibody alone, substantially ameliorated colitis and prolonged survival. Together, abrogation of immunosuppressive conditions mediated by IL-10-secreting neutrophils might be an alternative strategy to treat chronic inflammatory diseases at least under certain conditions.

This study identified an unusual pattern of reciprocal expression of Mincle on peripheral blood monocytes or neutrophils isolated from the same donor. Expression on monocytes was inversely correlated with phagocytosis and yeast killing, but was necessary for the induction of inflammatory cytokines in response to ex vivo Candida challenge. In contrast, Mincle expression on neutrophils was associated with phagocytic and candidacidal potential of those cells. Candida challenge upregulated Mincle expression but only in Mincle+ cells. These data highlight species-specific differences between the regulation of Mincle expression in mouse and man. Reciprocal expression of Mincle modified the candidacidal potential of monocytes or neutrophils, suggesting it may also polarize the type of host response to fungal infection.

Ii associates with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and targets the complex in the endocytic pathway to allow antigenic peptide loading. The human Iip35 isoform includes a cytoplasmic extension containing a di-arginine motif causing ER retention. This minor isoform does not exist in mice and its function in humans has not been thoroughly investigated. We have recently generated transgenic mice expressing Iip35 and these were crossed with Ii-deficient mice to generate animals (Tgp35/mIiKO) expressing exclusively the human isoform. In these mice, we show that Iip35 is expressed in antigen presenting cells and is inducible by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Despite the low constitutive expression of the protein and some minor differences in the V beta repertoire of Tgp35/mIiKO mice, Iip35 restored thymic selection of CD4(+) T cells and of invariant natural killer T cells. In vitro functional assays using purified primary macrophages treated with IFN-gamma showed that Iip35 allows presentation of an Ii-dependent ovalbumin T-cell epitope. Altogether, our results suggest that Iip35 is functional and does not require co-expression of other isoforms for antigen presentation.

To understand the mechanisms of PI3K regulation during B-cell activation, we performed a series of biochemical analysis on primary B cells, and found that activity of Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK) is crucial for the activation of PI3K following BCR ligation and this is regulated by the SFK Lyn. We show that the hyperresponsive phenotype of B cells lacking Lyn is predicated on significantly increased basal and inducible PI3K activity that correlates with the constitutive hypophosphorylation of PAG/Cbp (phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains/Csk-binding protein), a concomitant reduction in bound Csk in Lyn(-/-) B cells and elevated levels of active Fyn. Regulating SFK activity may thus be a central mechanism by which Lyn regulates PI3K activity in B cells. This study defines the molecular connection between the BCR and PI3K and reveals this to be a point of Lyn-mediated regulation.

The route by which circulating Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites cross the vascular endothelium to enter the human retina is unknown. Convincing studies using murine encephalitis models have strongly implicated leukocyte taxis as one pathway used by the parasite to access target organs. To establish whether tachyzoites might also interact directly with vascular endothelium, we populated a transwell system with human ocular endothelial cells. Human retinal endothelial monolayers permitted transmigration of tachyzoites of RH and three natural isolate strains. Antibody blockade of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 significantly reduced this migration, but did not impact tachyzoite movement across an endothelial monolayer derived from the choroid, which lies adjacent to the retina within the eye. In demonstrating that tachyzoites are capable of independent migration across human vascular endothelium in vitro, this study carries implications for the development of therapeutics aimed at preventing access of T. gondii to the retina.

However, the lack of RNA-specific modeling techniques demands the development of new tools for RNA-targeted rational drug design. Herein, we implemented integrated approaches of accurate RNA modeling and virtual screening for RNA inhibitor discovery with the most comprehensive evaluation to date of five docking and 11 scoring methods. For the first time, statistical analysis was heavily employed to assess the significance of our predictions. We found that GOLD:GOLD Fitness and rDock:rDock_solv could accurately predict the RNA ligand poses, and ASP rescoring further improved the ranking of ligand binding poses. Due to the weak correlations (R-2 < 0.3) of existing scoring with experimental binding affinities, we implemented two new RNA-specific scoring functions, iMDLScore1 and iMDLScore2, and obtained better correlations with R-2 = 0.70 and 0.79, respectively. We also proposed a multistep virtual screening approach and demonstrated that rDock:rDock_solv together with iMDLScore2 rescoring obtained the best enrichment on the flexible RNA targets, whereas GOLD:GOLD Fitness combined with rDock_solv rescoring outperformed other methods for rigid RNAs. This study provided practical strategies for RNA modeling and offered new insights into RNA small molecule interactions for drug discovery.

In this study, the expression of C19MC-MIR371-3 clusters and the molecular mechanisms presiding their modulation were investigated in a series of six normal parathyroids, 24 adenomas (Ad), 15 Ca and five matched metastases. The general expression levels of C19MC or MIR371-3 clusters in Ad lesions did not differ from normal glands, while they distinguished Ad from Ca at unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis (P=0.0008). MIR517C showed the most significant difference in expression between Ca and Ad (P=0.0003) and it positively correlated with serum calcium, parathormone and tumour weight. In regard to the molecular mechanism determining C19MC cluster activation, we could detect C19MC copy number (CN) gain in ten Ca (67%) extending distal to the MIR371-3 cluster in almost all samples. Conversely, only four Ad (16%) showed C19MC amplification, with one case presenting distal genomic aberration to MIR371-3. Globally, CN variations of 19q13.4 loci were significantly associated with MIR517C up-regulation (P=0.006). Opposite to normal glands where C19MC promoter was methylated, hypomethylation occurred in 15 out of 30 analysed tumours. Though the epigenetic status did not correlate with C19MC miRNA expression levels, loss of C19MC promoter methylation was significantly associated with Ca and metastatic disease (P=0.01). In conclusion, C19MC cluster aberrations are a characteristic of Ca with respect to Ad. Altogether, these evidences point towards a role for 19q13.4 miRNA clusters as oncogenes in parathyroid tumourigenesis.

Diverse bioinformatics tools have been developed to help unravel these mechanisms, by handling and processing data at different stages: from data collection and storage to the identification of molecular targets and from the detection of DNA motif signatures in the regulatory sequences of functionally related genes to the identification of relevant regulatory networks. Moreover, the large amount of genome-wide scale data recently produced has attracted professionals from diverse backgrounds to this cutting-edge realm of molecular biology. This mini-review is intended as an orientation for multidisciplinary professionals, introducing a streamlined workflow in gene transcription regulation with emphasis on sequence analysis.

Likewise, proteomics can provide important functional information regarding biosynthetic pathways, as well as insights into mechanism of action, of novel marine natural products. The goal of this review is to (1) explore the application of proteomics methodologies to marine systems, (2) assess the technical approaches that have been used, and (3) evaluate the pros and cons of this proteomic research, with the intent of providing a critical analysis of its future roles in marine sciences. To date, proteomics techniques have been utilized to investigate marine microbe, plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate physiology, developmental biology, seafood safety, susceptibility to disease, and responses to environmental change. However, marine proteomics studies often suffer from poor experimental design, sample processing/optimization difficulties, and data analysis/interpretation issues. Moreover, a major limitation is the lack of available annotated genomes and proteomes for most marine organisms, including several ""model species"". Even with these challenges in mind, there is no doubt that marine proteomics is a rapidly expanding and powerful integrative molecular research tool from which our knowledge of the marine environment, and the natural products from this resource, will be significantly expanded.

In this study, we describe the eggs of Malacopsylla grossiventris and Phthiropsylla agenoris and compare their surface ultrastructure using scanning electron microscopy. Eggs of both flea species are similar in their general appearance, i.e., the presence of disks and absence of lateral aeropyles, but they differ in size, texture of the surface, and number of micropyles and aeropyles. In addition, the eggs of M. grossiventris and P. agenoris are larger (719-800 mu m) than most of the flea eggs known (<600 pi m), and the length/width ratio is 2.0, while it varies between 1.6 and 1.8 in other species. As opposed to other large species, malacopsyllids have expandable (telescoping) abdomens that display growth. It is possible that a clutch of eggs has more than 2 eggs. Females of M. grossiventris were observed fixed with their mouthparts to the skin of their hosts. Indeed, some of these specimens were observed copulating on the venter of their hosts.

Although seaweeds are known to be vulnerable to physical and chemical changes in the marine environment, the impacts of ongoing and future anthropogenic climate change in seaweed-dominated ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe the ways in which changes in the environment directly affect seaweeds in terms of their physiology, growth, reproduction, and survival. We consider the extent to which seaweed species may be able to respond to these changes via adaptation or migration. We also examine the extensive reshuffling of communities that is occurring as the ecological balance between competing species changes, and as top-down control by herbivores becomes stronger or weaker. Finally, we delve into some of the ecosystem-level responses to these changes, including changes in primary productivity, diversity, and resilience. Although there are several key areas in which ecological insight is lacking, we suggest that reasonable climate-related hypotheses can be developed and tested based on current information. By strategically prioritizing research in the areas of complex environmental variation, multiple stressor effects, evolutionary adaptation, and population, community, and ecosystem-level responses, we can rapidly build upon our current understanding of seaweed biology and climate change ecology to more effectively conserve and manage coastal ecosystems.

This characteristic suggests the possibility of exploiting species from this group as renewable sources for jet fuel. An oil-rich strain of Botryococcus (Trebouxiophyceae) was isolated from a freshwater pond in the state of Bahia, Brazil, and is presently maintained under standard conditions at the Culture Collection of the Institute of Biology, Federal University of Bahia. The taxonomic classification of the species was based on light microscopy (LM); and TEM and SEM were used to better characterize its features, which have never before been described at this level. The LM characterization included the size of the colonies (35.7157 mu m) and cells (810 x 59 mu m) and their connection in sub-colonies by mucilaginous strands, as well as the presence of mucilaginous processes on the periphery of some of the colonies, with most of the cells included inside the colony. Reproduction occurred through divisions into two to four autospores. These features characterized the species as Botryococcus terribilis Komarek and Marvan. The TEM study showed, in addition to the presence of starch grains, pyrenoids that are penetrated by thick thylakoids. The pyrenoid bodies appear as electron-dense protein inclusions located in the chloroplast and surrounded by a starch sheath.

The SAXS experiments yield one-dimensional profile that needs further analysis to reveal structural information. The pair distance distribution function (PDDF), P(r), can provide molecular structures more intuitively, and it can be used to guide ab initio model reconstructions, making it a critical step to derive P(r) from experimental SAXS profiles. To calculate the P(r) curves, a new method based on a specially designed parametric functional form is developed, and implemented in pregxs. This method is tested against both synthetic and experimental data, the estimated P(r) functions are in good agreement with correct or known P(r). The method can also predict the molecular size.

Method: Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA expression and DNA methylation of GST-PI in paired tumor (T) and non-tumor (N) lung tissue of 91 NSCLC patients. Of all 91 patients 49% were stage 1,21% stage II and 30% stage IIIA. Forty-seven percent of the patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 36% adenocarcinoma and 17% large cell carcinoma. All patients were R0 resected.

Results: GST-PI mRNA expression could be measured in 100% in both (T and N) tissues; GST-PI DNA methylation was detected in 14% (N) and 14% (T). The median GST-PI mRNA expression in N was 7.83 (range: 0.01-19.43) and in T 13.15 (range: 0.01-116.8; p <= 0.001). The median GST-PI methylation was not significantly different between land N. No associations were seen between the mRNA expression or DNA methylation levels and clinical or histopathologic parameters such as gender, age, TNM stage, tumor histology and grading. The median survival of the investigated patients was 59.7 years (the median follow-up was 85.9 months). High GST-PI DNA methylation was significantly associated with a worse prognosis (p = 0.041, log rank test). No correlation was found between the GST-PI DNA methylation levels and the correlating mRNA expression levels.

Conclusion: GST-PI mRNA expression seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. High levels of GST-PI DNA methylation in tumor tissue of NSCLC patients have a potential as a biomarker identifying subpopulations with a more aggressive tumor biology. Quantitation of GST-PI DNA methylation may be a useful method to identify patients with a poor prognosis after curative resection and who will benefit from intensive adjuvant therapy.

Whether HR on admission could be correlated and perhaps participate to inflammation has not been reported. Methods: Between March 2007 and February 2010, we conducted a retrospective study on all patients admitted to our center for acute pericarditis. Diagnosis criteria included two of the following ones: typical chest pain, friction rub, pericardial effusion on cardiac echography, or typical electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. Primary end-point was biology: CRP on admission, on days 1, 2, 3, and especially peak. Results: We included 73 patients. Median age was 38 years (interquartiles 28-51) and median hospitalization duration was 2.0 days (1.5-3.0). Median heart rate was 88.0 beats per minute (bpm) on admission (interquartiles 76.0-100.0) and 72.0 on discharge (65.0-80.0). Heart rate on admission was significantly correlated with CRP peak (p < 0.001), independently of temperature on admission, hospitalization duration and age. Recurrences occurred within 1 month in 32% of patients. Heart rate on hospital discharge was correlated with recurrence, independently of age. Conclusion: In acute pericarditis, heart rate on admission is independently correlated with CRP levels and heart rate on discharge seems to be independently correlated to recurrence. This could suggest a link between heart rate and pericardial inflammation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study uses scale-invariant microvascular morphological quantification to track vessel maturation and remodeling in a split-thickness skin-grafting model over 21 days, comparing the results to classical techniques. Methods: Images from a previous study of split-thickness skin grafting in rats were analyzed. Microvascular morphology (fractal and multifractal dimensions, lacunarity, and vessel density) within fibrin interfaces of samples over time was quantified using classical semi-automated methods and automated multifractal and lacunarity analyses. Results: Microvessel morphology increased in density and complexity, from three to seven days after engraftment and then regressed by 21 days. Vessel density increased from 0.07 on day 3 to 0.20 on day 7 and then decreased to 0.06 on day 21. A similar trend was seen for the fractal dimension that increased from 1.56 at three days to 1.77 at seven days then decreased to 1.57 by 21 days. Vessel diameters did not change whereas complexity and density did, signaling remodeling. Conclusions: This new automated analysis identified design parameters for tissue engraftment and could be used in other models of graft vessel biology to track proliferation and pruning of complex vessel beds.

This wide range may reflect differences in the efficacy of selection due to differences in the effective population size (N-e). However, most comparisons have been made among distantly related organisms that differ not only in N-e but also in many other aspects of their biology. Here, we estimate alpha in three closely related lineages of house mice that have a similar ecology but differ widely in N-e: Mus musculus musculus (N-e similar to 25,000-120,000), M. m. domesticus (N-e similar to 58,000-200,000), and M. m. castaneus (N-e similar to 200,000-733,000). Mice were genotyped using a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array, and the proportions of replacement and silent mutations within subspecies were compared with those fixed between each subspecies and an outgroup, Mus spretus. There was significant evidence of positive selection in M. m. castaneus, the lineage with the largest N-e, with alpha estimated to be approximately 40%. In contrast, estimates of alpha for M. m. domesticus (alpha = 13%) and for M. m. musculus (alpha = 12 %) were much smaller. Interestingly, the higher estimate of alpha for M. m. castaneus appears to reflect not only more adaptive fixations but also more effective purifying selection. These results support the hypothesis that differences in N-e contribute to differences among species in the efficacy of selection.

However, an early study of the pike cichlid's visual system suggested a lack of short-wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors, a surprising finding as many African cichlids have highly developed short-wavelength vision. In this study, we found evidence for only four expressed cone opsins (LWS, RH2a, SWS2a, and SWS2b), plus one pseudogene (RH2b). Taken together with our microspectrophotometry data, which revealed the presence of three types of cone photoreceptor, including one sensitive to short-wavelength light, this would indicate a broader spectral capacity than previously believed from earlier visual studies of this fish. Relative to the highly diverse African cichlids, however, this Neotropical cichlid appears to have a greatly reduced opsin complement, reflecting both gene loss along the Neotropical lineage (lacking functional RH2b and, possibly, SWS1 opsins) and gene duplication within the African clade (which possesses paralogous RH2a alpha and RH2a beta opsins). Molecular evolutionary analyses show that positive selection has shaped the SWS2b and RH1 opsins along the Neotropical lineage, which may be indicative of adaptive evolution to alter nonspectral aspects of opsin biology. These results represent the first molecular evolutionary study of visual pigments in a Neotropical cichlid and thus provide a foundation for further study of a morphologically and ecologically diverse clade that has been understudied with respect to the link between visual ecology and diversification.

Yet the genetic and genomic architectures that produce genetic variation to enable environmental adaptation have remained poorly understood. Here we show that the proportion of duplicated genes (P-D) in the whole genomes of fully sequenced Drosophila species is significantly correlated with environmental variability within the habitats measured by the climatic envelope and habitat diversity. Furthermore, species with a low P-D tend to lose the duplicated genes owing to their faster evolution. These results indicate that the rapid relaxation of functional constraints on duplicated genes resulted in a low P-D for species with lower habitat diversity, and suggest that the maintenance of duplicated genes gives organisms an ecological advantage during evolution. We therefore propose that the P-D in a genome is related to adaptation to environmental variation.

Several T6SS components are proposed to be part of a macromolecular complex resembling the bacteriophage tail. The T6SS protein HsiE1 (TagJ) is unique to the H1-T6SS and absent from the H2- and H3-T6SSs. We demonstrate that HsiE1 interacts with a predicted N-terminal a-helix in HsiB1 (TssB) thus forming a novel subcomplex of the T6SS. HsiB1 is homologous to the Vibrio cholerae VipA component, which contributes to the formation of a bacteriophage tail sheath-like structure. We show that the interaction between HsiE1 and HsiB1 is specific and does not occur between HsiE1 and HsiB2. Proteins of the TssB family encoded in T6SS clusters lacking a gene encoding a TagJ-like component are often devoid of the predicted N-terminal helical region, which suggests co-evolution. We observe that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 20 amino acids of HsiB1 interacts with purified HsiE1 protein. This interaction is a common feature to other bacterial T6SSs that display a TagJ homologue as shown here with Serratia marcescens. We further show that hsiE1 is a non-essential gene for the T6SS and suggest that HsiE1 may modulate incorporation of HsiB1 into the T6SS.

Because of the distribution of many Lecanorchis taxa in various climate conditions, we hypothesized that mycorrhizal diversity and specificity are different among the different taxa of Lecanorchis. In the present study, identities of mycorrhizal fungi were examined for 90 individuals of 10 Lecanorchis taxa at 26 sites from Niigata to Okinawa Prefectures in Japan. Phylogenetic analyses of Lecanorchis taxa based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) divided the examined Lecanorchis taxa into three groups, groups A, B, and C. ITS rDNA sequences suggested that fungi associating with Lecanorchis were ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi in Lactarius, Russula, Atheliaceae, and Sebacina, with Lactarius and Russula dominant. Our results suggested some degree of mycorrhizal specialization among Lecanorchis taxa. Interestingly, the Lecanorchis group C had some specific relationships with Lactarius, whereas less specificity was found in the relationships with Russula. However, observed specificity results may be biased by geographic opportunity, and we suggest further research to assess whether Lecanorchis species are limited to the associations we observed.

Whether amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is also characterized by a presymptomatic period, and if so how long this period lasts, is unclear. Answers to these questions will not only inform our understanding of disease biology and potential environmental risk factors for ALS, but also the design and implementation of early therapeutic and even preventative clinical trials. Moreover, the potential impact of studying people at genetic risk for ALS, the only population in which it is currently possible to study presymptomatic disease, is underscored by recent progress in our understanding of the shared genetic basis of familial and apparently sporadic ALS. Studying presymptomatic ALS, however, has proven difficult due to the challenge in identifying an at-risk population and various logistical and ethical considerations. In this article we present the rationale for studying presymptomatic ALS, summarize the early evidence supporting the existence of a presymptomatic phase of the disease, and discuss the challenges of studying presymptomatic ALS.

Specifically, a library of mutant pathways is created by de novo assembly of promoter mutants of varying strengths for each pathway gene in a target organism followed by high-throughput screening/selection. To demonstrate this approach, a single round of COMPACTER was used to generate both a xylose utilizing pathway with near-highest efficiency and a cellobiose utilizing pathway with highest efficiency that were ever reported in literature for both laboratory and industrial yeast strains. Interestingly, these engineered xylose and cellobiose utilizing pathways were all host-specific.

Although the details of target hub regulation remain poorly understood, recent experiments suggest that pairs of miRNAs can cooperate if their binding sites reside in close proximity. To test this and other hypotheses, we established a novel approach to investigate mechanisms of collective miRNA repression. The approach presented here combines miRNA target prediction and transcription factor prediction with data from the literature and databases to generate a regulatory map for a chosen target hub. We then show how a kinetic model can be derived from the regulatory map. To validate our approach, we present a case study for p21, one of the first experimentally proved miRNA target hubs. Our analysis indicates that distinctive expression patterns for miRNAs, some of which interact cooperatively, fine-tune the features of transient and long-term regulation of target genes. With respect to p21, our model successfully predicts its protein levels for nine different cellular functions. In addition, we find that high abundance of miRNAs, in combination with cooperativity, can enhance noise buffering for the transcription of target hubs.

However, these 3D structures have rarely been applied to constructing efficient molecular devices that function in living cells. Here, we demonstrate a 3D structure-based molecular design principle for constructing short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated genetic information converters; these converters respond to specific proteins and trigger the desired gene expression by modulating the function of the RNA-processing enzyme Dicer. The inhibitory effect on Dicer cleavage against the shRNA designed to specifically bind to U1A spliceosomal protein was correlated with the degree of steric hindrance between Dicer and the shRNA-protein complex in vitro: The level of the hindrance was predicted based on the models. Moreover, the regulation of gene expression was achieved by using the shRNA converters designed to bind to the target U1A or nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p50 proteins expressed in human cells. The 3D molecular design approach is widely applicable for developing new devices in synthetic biology.

A variant in the 3'UTR of the KRAS oncogene, referred to as the KRAS variant, is associated with both cancer risk and altered tumor biology. Here, we test the hypothesis that the KRAS variant can act as a biomarker of outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and investigate the cause of altered outcome in KRAS variant-positive EOC patients. As this variant seems to be associated with tumor biology, we additionally test the hypothesis that this variant can be directly targeted to impact cell survival. EOC patients with complete clinical data were genotyped for the KRAS variant and analyzed for outcome (n = 536), response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 25) and platinum resistance (n = 306). Outcome was separately analyzed for women with known BRCA mutations (n = 79). Gene expression was analyzed on a subset of tumors with available tissue. Cell lines were used to confirm altered sensitivity to chemotherapy associated with the KRAS variant. Finally, the KRAS variant was directly targeted through small-interfering RNA/miRNA oligonucleotides in cell lines and survival was measured. Postmenopausal EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to die of ovarian cancer by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.57, P = 0.019, n = 279). Perhaps explaining this finding, EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to be platinum resistant (odds ratio 3.18, confidence interval: 1.31-7.72, P = 0.0106, n = 291). In addition, direct targeting of the KRAS variant led to a significant reduction in EOC cell growth and survival in vitro. These findings confirm the importance of the KRAS variant in EOC, and indicate that the KRAS variant is a biomarker of poor outcome in EOC likely due to platinum resistance. In addition, this study supports the hypothesis that these tumors have continued dependence on such 3'UTR lesions, and that direct targeting may be a viable future treatment approach.

Climate change may result in elevated temperatures affecting trematode transmission. Therefore understanding their thermobiology forms an important step in determining the future dynamics of parasite populations. An empirical relationship exists between the mean expected life span of lecithotrophic larvae and the half life of their population (t(0.5)) and therefore t(0.5) is a good indicator of glycogen utilization. In this study experimental data on the effects of temperature on miracidial survival were compiled from the scientific literature and evaluated in terms of metabolism using Q(10) and Arrhenius activation energy (E* or mu). Temperature poorly influenced survival/metabolism with all miracidia having distinct zone(s) of thermostability. Overall there were few differences in Q(10) and E* values between most species temperature ranges whilst there were only limited strain-specific variations in thermal responses of laboratory-maintained Schistosoma mansoni. Miracidia demonstrated a trend of greater thermal resistance than cercariae. In particular, comparative studies on 4 strains of the same species of miracidia and cercariae showed little correlation in thermal biology between the 2 life-history stages. The importance of these results for trematode transmission under global climate change is discussed. ", Parasitology 10.1152/physrev.00038.2011,ION CHANNELS IN PLANTS,"Abstract: Hedrich R. Ion Channels in Plants. Physiol Rev 92: 1777-1811, 2012; doi:10.1152/physrev.00038.2011.-Since the first recordings of single potassium channel activities in the plasma membrane of guard cells more than 25 years ago, patch-clamp studies discovered a variety of ion channels in all cell types and plant species under inspection. Their properties differed in a cell type- and cell membrane-dependent manner. Guard cells, for which the existence of plant potassium channels was initially documented, advanced to a versatile model system for studying plant ion channel structure, function, and physiology. Interestingly, one of the first identified potassium-channel genes encoding the Shaker-type channel KAT1 was shown to be highly expressed in guard cells. KAT1-type channels from Arabidopsis thaliana and its homologs from other species were found to encode the K+-selective inward rectifiers that had already been recorded in early patch-clamp studies with guard cells. Within the genome era, additional Arabidopsis Shaker-type channels appeared. All nine members of the Arabidopsis Shaker family are localized at the plasma membrane, where they either operate as inward rectifiers, outward rectifiers, weak voltage-dependent channels, or electrically silent, but modulatory subunits. The vacuole membrane, in contrast, harbors a set of two-pore K+ channels. Just very recently, two plant anion channel families of the SLAC/SLAH and ALMT/QUAC type were identified. SLAC1/SLAH3 and QUAC1 are expressed in guard cells and mediate Slow- and Rapid-type anion currents, respectively, that are involved in volume and turgor regulation. Anion channels in guard cells and other plant cells are key targets within often complex signaling networks. Here, the present knowledge is reviewed for the plant ion channel biology. Special emphasis is drawn to the molecular mechanisms of channel regulation, in the context of model systems and in the light of evolution.

Its method and design resemble those of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is a unique medical system that assisted the ancient Chinese in dealing with disease. The technology platforms of systems biology, especially metabolomics, could provide more rapid, direct, concise and effective methods for disease research. In particular, metabolomics could provide useful tools for exploring the essence of Chinese medicine syndromes (CMS) disease, facilitating personalized TCM. Moreover, metabolomics has the potential to enable mapping of early biochemical changes in disease and hence provide an opportunity to develop predictive biomarkers that can trigger earlier interventions. A future hope for the metabonomic approach is the identification of biomarkers that are able to highlight individuals likely to suffer from disease and enable early diagnosis of the disease or the identification of those at risk, and it will help to understand CMS and modernize TCM. In this review, we focus on the key role of robust metabolomic approaches as an aid for traditional herbal medicine; particular attention will be paid to the past successes in applications of metabonomics to contribute to low-molecular-weight metabolites (biomarkers) discovery in TCM research.

Here, we focus on methods to improve protein stability without comprising biological function. We found that the four isoforms of the Arabidopsis RAD23 protein family are relatively stable. The UBA2 domain derived from RAD23a can be used as a portable stabilizing signal to prolong the half-life of two unstable transcription factors (TFs), HFR1 and PIF3. The increased stability of the TFUBA2 fusion proteins results in an enhanced phenotype in transgenic plants compared to expression of the TF alone. Similar results were obtained for the RAD23a UBA1 domain. In addition to UBA1/2 of RAD23a, the UBA domain from the Arabidopsis DDI1 protein also increased the half-life of the unstable protein JAZ10.1, which is involved in jasmonate signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that UBA fusions can be used to increase the stability of unstable proteins for basic plant biology research as well as crop improvement.

Since high-throughput data for protein modifications are inherently incomplete, we developed a strategy to extend and validate such primary datasets. We selected interesting protein candidates from a global screen in yeast and employed a modified histidine biotin tag that allows tandem affinity purifications of our targets under denaturing conditions. Products in question can be digested directly from affinity resins and phosphopeptides can be further enriched via TiO2 before MS analysis. Our robust protocol can be amended for SILAC as well as iTRAQ quantifications or label-free approaches based on selective reaction monitoring, allowing completion of the phosphorylation pattern in a first step, followed by a detailed analysis of the phosphorylation kinetics. We exemplify the value of such a strategy by an in-depth analysis of Pan1, a highly phosphorylated factor involved in early steps of endocytosis.

Membrane proteins are of great interest particularly those with functional domains exposed to the extracellular environment. Integral membrane proteins represent about one-third of the proteins encoded by the human genome and assume a variety of key biological functions, such as cell-to-cell communication, receptor-mediated signal transduction, selective transport, and pharmacological actions. More than two-thirds of membrane proteins are drug targets, highlighting their immensely important pharmaceutical significance. Most plasma membrane proteins and proteins from other cellular membranes have several PTMs; for example, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and nitrosylation, and moreover, PTMs of proteins are known to play a key role in tumor biology. These modifications often cause change in stoichiometry and microheterogeneity in a protein molecule, which is apparent during electrophoretic separation. Furthermore, the analysis of glyco- and phosphoproteome of cell membrane presents a number of challenges mainly due to their low abundance, their large dynamic range, and the inherent hydrophobicity of membrane proteins. Under pathological conditions, PTMs, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are frequently altered and have been recognized as a potential source for disease biomarkers. Thus, their accurate differential expression analysis, along with differential PTM analysis is of paramount importance.

The objective of this study was to evaluate smother crop mixtures, seeded at different times, for Canada thistle control. Field trials were established in 2009 and 2010 to evaluate the ability of smother crop mixtures to suppress Canada thistle growth and development. Canada thistle aboveground biomass was suppressed 50% in 2009 and 87% in 2010 by the sorghum-sudangrass mixture, averaged over planting times. The oat mixture suppressed annual weed biomass more than 58% in 2009 and 67% in 2010 in all planting dates. Percent cover of Canada thistle was affected by crop mixture in 2009 and 2010, with sorghum-sudangrass being the most suppressive. The sorghum-sudangrass mixture was more suppressive of Canada thistle, probably because it included soybean and sunflower, all high-biomass, competitive crops. Planting date affected smother crop suppression of Canada thistle growth, but the effect was not consistent between 2009 and 2010 due to differences in weather conditions.

Although it has been in Prairie Canada for many years, basic biological and spatial data is lacking. In this study we determined growth rates and seed production using season long field data, statistically modelled season long growth, and developed an interpolated growing degree-day (GDD's) risk surface. We found that stems emerged from perennial root stocks in late May to early June after about 45 GDD's. On average, stems reached 50 % of their final height at about 338 GDD's, and final stem heights were reached at about 1007 GDD's. The mean number of seed capsules produced per stem was 276.4 while the mean number of seeds produced by a seed capsule was 79.4. We found that a three parameter logistic function was a robust predictor of growth (R (2) = 0.86). Our interpolated risk surface indicated that GDD's may be a constraining parameter for the distribution of purple loosestrife in Prairie Canada.

In habitats that remain unchanged for many generations, stabilizing selection maximizes exploitation of resources by reducing trait diversity to a narrow optimal range. One might expect that such ostensibly homogeneous populations would have a reduced potential for heritable adaptive responses when faced with fitness-reducing environmental changes. However, field studies have documented populations that, even after long periods of evolutionary stasis, can still rapidly evolve in response to changed environmental conditions. We argue that degeneracy, the ability of diverse population elements to function similarly, can satisfy both the current need to maximize fitness and the future need for diversity. Degenerate ensembles appear functionally redundant in certain environmental contexts and functionally diverse in others. We propose that genetic variation not contributing to the observed range of phenotypes in a current population, also known as cryptic genetic variation (CGV), is a specific case of degeneracy. We argue that CGV, which gradually accumulates in static populations in stable environments, reveals hidden trait differences when environments change. By allowing CGV accumulation, static populations prepare themselves for future rapid adaptations to environmental novelty. A greater appreciation of degeneracy's role in resolving the inherent tension between current stabilizing selection and future directional selection has implications in conservation biology and may be applied in social and technological systems to maximize current performance while strengthening the potential for future changes.

We aimed to review recent findings to investigate the potential for clinical use.

Methods: Relevant papers were identified through online searches regarding tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in colorectal cancer. Identified papers were studied, focusing on clinically applicable uses for TIL data in the management of colorectal cancer.

Findings: The majority of identified studies were retrospective and observational in nature. The widest TIL investigation was in post resection prognosis but TIL subtypes, counts and methodology showed variability between studies. Recent reports explored TIL in predicting response to adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments.

Conclusion: An increasing body of evidence supports that visibility of colorectal cancer to immune attack is substantial and that it limits disease progression. Analysis of the adaptive immune infiltrate in resected colorectal cancer specimens offers prognostic information which is independent of conventionally measured parameters and potentially superior in predictive value.

These receptors are the target of GnRH agonists (through receptor desensitization) and antagonists (through receptor blockade) for the treatment of steroid-dependent pathologies, including hormone-dependent tumors. It has also become increasingly clear that GnRH-R are expressed in cancer tissues, either related (i.e. prostate, breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers) or unrelated (i.e. melanoma, glioblastoma, lung, and pancreatic cancers) to the reproductive system. In hormone-related tumors, GnRH-R appear to be expressed even when the tumor has escaped steroid dependence (such as castration-resistant prostate cancer). These receptors are coupled to a G(alpha i)-mediated intracellular signaling pathway. Activation of tumor GnRH-R by means of GnRH agonists elicits a strong antiproliferative, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenic (more recently demonstrated) activity. Interestingly, GnRH antagonists have also been shown to elicit a direct antitumor effect; thus, these compounds behave as antagonists of GnRH-R at the pituitary level and as agonists of the same receptors expressed in tumors. According to the ligand-induced selective-signaling theory, GnRH-R might assume various conformations, endowed with different activities for GnRH analogs and with different intracellular signaling pathways, according to the cell context. Based on these consistent experimental observations, tumor GnRH-R are now considered a very interesting candidate for novel molecular, GnRH analog-based, targeted strategies for the treatment of tumors expressing these receptors. These agents include GnRH agonists and antagonists, GnRH analog-based cytotoxic (i.e. doxorubicin) or nutraceutic (i.e. curcumin) hybrids, and GnRH-R-targeted nanoparticles delivering anticancer compounds.

Our results here demonstrated that GNR-array as gain material embedded into a high finesse microcavity can serve as an ultralow lasing threshold nanolaser with promising applications ranging widely from optical fiber communication with increasing data processing speed to digital optical recording and biology spectroscopy.

The idea of an evolving universe dates back only to the 19th century, and became a guiding principle for astronomical research only in the second half of the 20th century. The modern synthesis in evolutionary biology hastened the acceptance of the idea in its cosmic setting, as did the confirmation of the Big Bang theory for the origin of the universe. NASA programmes such as Origins incorporated it as a guiding principle. Cosmic evolution encompasses physical, biological and cultural evolution, and may result in a physical, biological or postbiological universe, each with its own implications for long-term human destiny, and each imbuing the meaning of life with different values. It has the status of an increasingly accepted worldview that is beginning to have a profound effect not only in science but also in religion and philosophy.

Both are dependent on decoding those historic phenomena called 'fossils', here taken to include biogenic traces of activity and waste products. There is the shared problem of data restoration from incomplete data sets; the importance of contextual analysis of potentially viable habitats; the centrality of cell theory; the need to reject the null hypothesis of an abiogenic origin for candidate cells via morphospace analysis; the need to demonstrate biology-like behaviour (e.g., association with biofilm-like structures; tendency to form clusters and 'mats'; and a preference for certain substrates), and of metabolism-like behaviour (e.g., within the candidate cell wall; within surrounding 'waste products'; evidence for syntrophy and metabolic cycles; and evidence for metabolic tiers). We combine these ideas into a robust protocol for demonstrating ancient or extra-terrestrial life, drawing examples from Earth's early geological record, in particular from the earliest known freshwater communities of the 1.0 Ga Torridonian of Scotland, from the 1.9 Ga Gunflint Chert of Canada, from the 3.4 Ga Strelley Pool sandstone of Australia, and from the 3.46 Ga Apex Chert also of Australia.

Molecular Mechanisms and Personalized Medicine Meeting Report","Abstract: Objective: To review the current understanding of the underlying molecular, biologic, and genetic mechanisms involved in ovarian cancer development and how these mechanisms can be targets for prevention, detection, and treatment of the disease and its recurrence.

Methods: In May 2012, we convened a meeting of researchers, clinicians, and consumer advocates to review the state of current knowledge on molecular mechanisms and identify fruitful areas for further investigations.

Results: The meeting consisted of 7 scientific sessions ranging from Epidemiology, Early Detection, and Biology to Therapeutics and Quality of Life. Sessions consisted of talks and panel discussions by international leaders in ovarian cancer research. A special career development session by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer Academy as well as an oral abstract and poster session showcased promising new research by junior scientists.

Conclusions: Technological advances in the last decade have increased our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in a host of biological activities related to ovarian cancer. Understanding the role these mechanisms play in cancer initiation and progression will help lead to the development of prevention and treatment modalities that can be personalized to each patient, thereby helping to overcome this highly fatal malignancy.

In order to investigate the effect of phase disorder on dynamics of the array, we take into account that individual uncoupled Duffing oscillator with a parametric excitation is chaotic no matter what the initial phase of the excitation is. It is shown that phase disorder by randomly choosing the initial phases of excitations can suppress spatio-temporal chaos in the system coupled by chaotic Duffing oscillators. When all the phases are the same and deterministic, the oscillators remain chaotic and asynchronous no matter what the common phase is. When driven asynchronously by introducing phase disorder, the oscillators coupled in the array appear more regular with increase of the amplitude of random phase, and the highest level of synchrony between them is induced by intermediate phase disorder, displaying a resonance like phenomenon caused from the transition of the coupled oscillators from chaos to periodic motion. Since varying the initial phases of excitations is more feasible than altering parameters intrinsic to the oscillators coupled in an array, this study provides a practical method for control and synchronization of chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional, spatially extended systems, which might have potential applications in engineering, neuroscience and biology.

In addition, the identified genetic determinants may be used to enhance current risk factor profiles.

Evidence Acquisition: There have been more than 40 published GWAS on skeletal phenotypes, predominantly focused on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and spine.

Evidence Synthesis: Sixty-six BMD loci have been replicated across all the published GWAS, confirming the highly polygenic nature of BMD variation. Only seven of the 66 previously reported genes (LRP5, SOST, ESR1, TNFRSF11B, TNFRSF11A, TNFSF11, PTH) from candidate gene association studies have been confirmed by GWAS. Among 59 novel BMD GWAS loci that have not been reported by previous candidate gene association studies, some have been shown to be involved in key biological pathways involving the skeleton, particularly Wnt signaling (AXIN1, LRP5, CTNNB1, DKK1, FOXC2, HOXC6, LRP4, MEF2C, PTHLH, RSPO3, SFRP4, TGFBR3, WLS, WNT3, WNT4, WNT5B, WNT16), bone development: ossification (CLCN7, CSF1, MEF2C, MEPE, PKDCC, PTHLH, RUNX2, SOX6, SOX9, SPP1, SP7), mesenchymal-stem-cell differentiation (FAM3C, MEF2C, RUNX2, SOX4, SOX9, SP7), osteoclast differentiation (JAG1, RUNX2), and TGF-signaling (FOXL1, SPTBN1, TGFBR3). There are still 30 BMD GWAS loci without prior molecular or biological evidence of their involvement in skeletal phenotypes. Other skeletal phenotypes that either have been or are being studied include hip geometry, bone ultrasound, quantitative computed tomography, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography, biochemical markers, and fractures such as vertebral, nonvertebral, hip, and forearm.

Conclusions: Although several challenges lie ahead as GWAS moves into the next generation, there are prospects of new discoveries in skeletal biology. This review integrates findings from previous GWAS and provides a roadmap for future directions building on current GWAS successes.

In a recent work, we reported that the transcriptional regulator Id1 contributes to thyroid cancer progression by powering the invasion capacity of tumor cells.

Objective: The intent of this work was to further investigate the biology of invasive thyroid tumors, through the analysis of the molecular interactions existing between Id1 and some of its target genes and through the characterization of the function of these factors in the progression of thyroid tumors.

Results: We showed that Id1 controls the expression of the Runx2 isoform I and that this transcription factor plays a central role in mediating the Id1 proinvasive function in thyroid tumor cells. We demonstrated that Runx2 regulates proliferation, migration, and invasiveness by activating a panel of genes involved in matrix degradation and cellular invasion, which we previously identified as Id1 target genes in thyroid tumor cells. Finally, we show that Runx2 is strongly expressed in metastatic human thyroid tumors both at the primary site and in metastases.

Conclusion: Overall, our experiments demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown molecular axis that controls thyroid tumor invasiveness by altering the ability of tumor cells to interact with the surrounding microenvironment. These factors could prove to be valuable markers that permit early diagnosis of aggressive thyroid tumors.

To analyze the tree-structured data, various measures for computing the similarity between them have been developed and applied. Among them, tree edit distance is one of the most widely used measures. However, the tree edit distance problem for unordered trees is NP-hard. Therefore, it is required to develop efficient algorithms for the problem. Recently, a practical method called clique-based algorithm has been proposed, but it is not fast for large trees.

This article presents an improved clique-based method for the tree edit distance problem for unordered trees. The improved method is obtained by introducing a dynamic programming scheme and heuristic techniques to the previous clique-based method. To evaluate the efficiency of the improved method, we applied the method to comparison of real tree structured data such as glycan structures. For large tree-structures, the improved method is much faster than the previous method. In particular, for hard instances, the improved method achieved more than 100 times speed-up.

Here we present SLIQ, a set of simple linear inequalities derived from the geometry of contigs on the line that can be used to predict the relative positions and orientations of contigs from individual mate pair reads and thus produce a contig digraph. The SLIQ inequalities can also filter out unreliable mate pairs and can be used as a preprocessing step for any scaffolding algorithm. We tested the SLIQ inequalities on five real data sets ranging in complexity from simple bacterial genomes to complex mammalian genomes and compared the results to the majority voting procedure used by many other scaffolding algorithms. SLIQ predicted the relative positions and orientations of the contigs with high accuracy in all cases and gave more accurate position predictions than majority voting for complex genomes, in particular the human genome. Finally, we present a simple scaffolding algorithm that produces linear scaffolds given a contig digraph. We show that our algorithm is very efficient compared to other scaffolding algorithms while maintaining high accuracy in predicting both contig positions and orientations for real data sets.

It enables very fast detection of clashes and free potential energy calculations. The efficiency of chain trees is closely related to the bounding volumes associated with chain tree nodes. A protein subchain associated with a node of a chain tree will clash with another subchain only if their bounding volumes intersect. It is therefore essential that bounding volumes are as tight as possible while intersection tests can be carried out efficiently. We compare the performance of four different types of bounding volumes in connection with the rotation of protein bonds. It is observed that oriented bounding boxes are not as good as could be expected judging by their extensive use in various applications. Both rectangular-and line-swept spheres are shown to have very good tightness of fit but the line-swept, or even simple spheres, are shown to be significantly faster because of quick overlap checks. We also investigate how the performance of the recently introduced adjustable chain trees is affected by different bounding volume types.

Moreover, recent studies demonstrate that several MAPKs bind directly to chromatin at target genes.

The wheatear, a small songbird, has declined dramatically throughout Europe. It is known to live in alpine meadows, in tundra, and rural landscapes as well as in urban areas, but it is unknown if these urban populations reproduce sufficiently. This study aimed to investigate reproductive success and habitat requirements of the wheatear in the city of Berlin, Germany. We analysed occurrence and breeding success in relation to vegetation and surface structure of the settled sites, intensity of direct disturbance by humans and dogs, as well as degree of sealing and residential population density in the surrounding urban matrix. Finally, we compared early-settled to late-settled territories to appraise habitat preferences of wheatears.

The proportion of successful nests was high (73%) compared to other regions and habitats. Area size of a site greatly affected the probability of wheatear occurrence; it was much higher on sites larger than five hectare. Factors affecting breeding success differed completely from those explaining variation in occurrence, indicating that breeding success seems not to be related to habitat preferences. There was no influence of the urban matrix at a landscape level (200 m and 2000 m zone) on occurrence or breeding success. To maintain and create habitat for endangered open-land species as the wheatear, we recommend minimum area size of five hectare, sparse vegetation, open soils, short grass, and very few trees and shrubs.

Chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) are important in this resource portfolio because of their demonstrated use for gene discovery, genetic and epigenetic studies, functional characterizations, and systems analysis. CSSs are made by replacing a single chromosome in a host strain with the corresponding chromosome from a donor strain. A complete CSS panel involves a total of 22 engineered inbred strains, one for each of the 19 autosomes, one each for the X and Y chromosomes, and one for mitochondria. A genome survey simply involves comparing each phenotype for each of the CSSs with the phenotypes of the host strain. The CSS panels that are available for laboratory mice have been used to dissect a remarkable variety of phenotypes and to characterize an impressive array of disease models. These surveys have revealed considerable phenotypic diversity even among closely related progenitor strains, evidence for strong epistasis and for heritable epigenetic changes. Perhaps most importantly, and presumably because of their unique genetic constitution, CSSs, and congenic strains derived from them, the genetic variants underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are readily identified and functionally characterized. Together these studies show that CSSs are important resource for laboratory mice. ", Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity
